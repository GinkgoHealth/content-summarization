text,"Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course
[This appears to be the discussion]:
In addition to providing empirical measures and predictive equations for total expenditure from infancy to old age (Tables S1, S2), our analyses bring to light major changes in metabolic rate across the life course. To begin, we can infer fetal metabolic rates from maternal measures during pregnancy: if body size-adjusted expenditures were elevated in the fetus, then adjusted expenditures for pregnant mothers, particularly late in pregnancy when the fetus accounts for a substantial portion of a mothers weight, would be likewise elevated. Instead, the stability of adjusted total and basal expenditures at ~100% during pregnancy (Figure 2B) indicates that the growing fetus maintains a fat free mass- and fat mass-adjusted metabolic rate similar to adults, which is consistent with adjusted expenditures of neonates (both ~100%; Figure 2) in the first weeks after birth. Total and basal expenditures, both absolute and size-adjusted values, then accelerate rapidly over the first year. This early period of metabolic acceleration corresponds to a critical period in early development in which growth often falters in nutritionally-stressed populations (19). Increasing energy demands could be a contributing factor.
After rapid acceleration in total and basal expenditure during the first year, adjusted expenditures progressively decline thereafter, reaching adult levels at ~20 yr. Elevated adjusted expenditures in this life stage may reflect the metabolic demands of growth and development. Adult expenditures, adjusted for body size and composition, are remarkably stable, even during pregnancy and post-partum. Declining metabolic rates in older adults could increase the risk of weight gain. However, neither fat mass nor percentage increased in this period (Figure S3), consistent with the hypothesis that energy intake is coupled to expenditure (20).
Following previous studies (2125), we calculated the effect of organ size on basal expenditure over the lifespan (Methods). At rest, the tissue-specific metabolic rates (Watts/gram) of the heart, liver, brain, and kidneys are much greater than those of the muscles and other lean tissue or fat (2125). Organs with a high tissue-specific metabolic rate, particularly the brain and liver, account for a greater proportion of fat free mass in young individuals, and thus organ-based basal expenditure, estimated from organ size and tissue-specific metabolic rate, follows a power-law relationship with fat free mass, roughly consistent with observed basal expenditures (Methods, Figure S6). Still, observed basal expenditure exceeded organ-based estimates by ~30% in early life (1  20 y) and was ~20% lower than organ-based estimates in subjects over 60 y (Figure S6), consistent with previous work indicating that tissue-specific metabolic rates are elevated in children and adolescents (22, 24) and reduced in older adults (21, 23, 25).
We investigated the contributions of daily physical activity and changes in tissue-specific metabolic rate to total and basal expenditure using a simple model with two components: activity and basal expenditure (Figure 3; Methods). Activity expenditure was modeled as a function of physical activity and body mass, assuming activity costs are proportional to weight, and could either remain constant at adult levels over the lifespan or follow the trajectory of daily physical activity measured via accelerometry, peaking at 5  10 y and declining thereafter (11, 26, 27) (Figure 3). Similarly, basal expenditure was modeled as a power function of fat free mass (consistent with organ-based BEE estimates; Methods) multiplied by a tissue specific metabolism term, which could either remain constant at adult levels across the lifespan or follow the trajectory observed in adjusted basal expenditure (Figure 2). For each scenario, total expenditure was modeled as the sum of activity and basal expenditure (Methods).
Models that hold physical activity or tissue-specific metabolic rates constant over the lifespan do not reproduce the observed patterns of age-related change in absolute or adjusted measures of total or basal expenditure (Figure 3). Only when age-related changes in physical activity and tissue-specific metabolism are included does model output match observed expenditures, indicating that variation in both physical activity and tissue-specific metabolism contribute to total expenditure and its components across the lifespan. Elevated tissue-specific metabolism in early life may be related to growth or development (22, 24). Conversely, reduced expenditures in later life may reflect a decline in organ level metabolism (23, 25, 28).
Metabolic models of life history commonly assume continuity in tissue-specific metabolism over the life course, with cellular metabolic rates increasing in a power-law manner (Energy = aMassb) and the energy available for growth during the juvenile period made available for reproduction in adults (29, 30). Measures of humans here challenge this view, with size adjusted metabolism elevated ~50% in childhood compared to adults (including pregnant females), and ~25% lower in the oldest subjects. It remains to be determined whether these fluctuations occur in other species. In addition to affecting energy balance, nutritional needs, and body weight, these metabolic changes present a potential target for clinical investigation into the kinetics of disease, pharmaceutical activity, and healing, processes intimately related to metabolic rate. Further, there is considerable metabolic variation among individuals, with TEE and its components varying more than ± 20% even when controlling for fat free mass, fat mass, sex, and age (Figure 1, ?,2,2, Table S2). Elucidating the processes underlying metabolic changes across the life course and variation among individuals may help reveal the roles of metabolic variation in health and disease.

","High doses of anti-inflammatory drugs compromise muscle strength and hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young adults.

Discussion 
The interest in this study was spurred by the intriguing observation that while NSAIDs might have a negative impact on acute exercise responses (satellite cell activity, translational signalling and protein synthesis), previous human studies have failed to demonstrate a detrimental effect of NSAIDs on the development of muscle hypertrophy in response to chronic resistance training in young adults, possibly due to differences in drug dosage across studies. Accordingly, in the current study, healthy young men and women performed 8 weeks of supervised resistance training with concomitant high- or low-dose NSAID treatment. The major and novel findings were that 1) maximal overthe-counter doses of ibuprofen compromised resistance exercise-induced muscle hypertropy
independent of training mode; 2) increases in muscle strength were attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions; 3) while the resistance-training intervention resulted in several muscle molecular adaptations, the only marked difference across medical treatment was a significant ibuprofen-induced downregulation of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 mRNA, compared with an upregulation in the ASA group. This is the first study showing that daily consumption of high doses of NSAIDs attenuates strength and muscle hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young healthy individuals. We acknowledge that a limitation of the current study was that we did not include a non-treated control group. However, the increase in muscle volume (7.5%) in the ASA group was of a similar, and expected, magnitude to that previously reported by our group20 and others.21,22 In the light of this, the magnitude of the reduction in muscle hypertrophy in response to the ibuprofen treatment was quite remarkable and, if anything, should the ASA treatment have had a small effect on the adaptive response, it would only have masked an even greater difference across groups than what is reported herein. Nonetheless, given the marked effect of ibuprofen and the fact that the increase in muscle size in the control group (0.14% per day) was of similar magnitude as the average rate of hypertrophy reported in past studies employing knee-extensor resistance training,23 we are confident that our data provide strong proof-of-principle evidence that the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent of the dose of intake. The rationale for using acetylsalicylic acid instead of ibuprofen as a low-dose comparator in the current study was based on the fact that when the drug is consumed orally, it undergoes substantial presystemic hydrolysis in the gut and liver before it enters the systemic bloodstream. As the drug will, however, encounter blood in the portal circulation, low doses of acetylsalicylic acid will exert its antiplatelet effect with no or limited effect on systemic targets such as peripheral tissue.1618 Consequently, the potential circulatory effects are factored out and we hypothesize that the negative effect of ibuprofen was due to muscle-specific COX inhibition rather than the antiplatelet effect achieved by both ibuprofen and low doses of acetylsalicylic acid.18,24 The results of the present study are in agreement with animal studies showing an inhibitory effect of COX inhibitors on muscle hypertrophy.8,9,25 They also agree with acute human data reporting attenuated protein synthesis,5 translational signalling13 and satellite cell activity11,12 in response to resistance training with concomitant high-dose NSAID administration. Our hypothesis of a dose-dependent effect is also supported by the only comparable training study in young healthy subjects.14 That particular study reported no effect of ibuprofen on muscle hypertrophy or strength gains after 6 weeks of training consisting of six sets of biceps curls 23 days week---------------1 . The drug dose was consumed on training days only, resulting in a total intake of 8001200 mg week---------------1 , 14 compared with 1200 mg per day in the current study. This indeed highlights the potential importance of drug dosage where, evidently, intake of maximal over-the-counter doses is potent enough to interfere with the normal hypertrophic development of 0.10.2% per day seen in the ASA group as well as in other studies employing conventional resistance-training programmes for the knee extensors.23 It is generally agreed that repeated increases in muscle protein synthesis following each exercise bout is the most important mechanism underlying training-induced muscle hypertrophy.26,27 Thus, it seems plausible to suggest that the main explanation for the clear attenuation of hypertrophy, which was evident in both training modes (FW and WS), was diminished prostaglandin production and hence decreased muscle protein synthetic response after each training session in the IBU group. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that COX and prostaglandins play an important role in regulating the molecular events controlling muscle hypertrophy. For example, C2C12 myotube diameter was shown to be regulated by PGF2a in an mTORdependent manner7 , and exercise-induced increases in p70S6K (downstream of mTOR) was blunted by ibuprofen treatment in the early hours following acute resistance exercise.13 In the current study, however, there were no group interactions for any of the target proteins examined, suggesting that the ibuprofenmodulating effect on muscle adaptations is not associated with differential expression of steady-state proteins in response to chronic training. Perhaps assessing satellite cell content,11 or the phosphorylation levels of translational signalling proteins in response to acute exercise,13 would have provided more mechanistic insights. We measured several key molecular markers for COX and prostaglandin-mediated metabolism, regulators of muscle growth and atrophy, and several cytokines and myokines that have been shown to regulate skeletal muscle protein metabolism and exercise adaptations.4 The most clear-cut molecular evidence for an effect of ibuprofen on peripheral muscle tissue was the marked drug effect on IL-6 mRNA, where levels in the ibuprofen group were downregulated despite a significant upregulation in the control group. The reduction of IL-6 in the ibuprofen group is coherent with previous studies suggesting PGE2 as a stimulator of IL-6 transcription in both human muscle28 and other cell types.29 It has previously been reported that the NSAID-modulating effects on muscle hypertrophy in older subjects were associated with lowered expression of IL-6 and subsequently MuRF-1, resulting in a more beneficial cellular environment for muscle growth.30 While our data are coherent with that of Trappe and colleagues regarding the expression of IL-6 in the ibuprofen-treated group (downregulated) compared to the control group (upregulated), the muscle hypertrophy data certainly contradict these findings. In that study, elderly subjects (6078 years) performed 12 weeks of resistance training with simultaneous daily ibuprofen treatment of 1200 mg. The increase in muscle size was substantially greater with ibuprofen compared with placebo,15 and this was supported by acute data showing no interference of ibuprofen on muscle protein synthesis in the same age group.31 Thus, interestingly, there may be distinct differences in the response to resistance training and NSAID consumption in the young vs. the elderly, and probably also in the mechanistic underpinnings of exercise-induced tissue remodelling in these age groups. Specifically, in the present cohort of young subjects, it is possible that blunting of important inflammatory processes, as reflected by the downregulated IL-6 gene expression, contributed to the attenuated hypertrophic response because previous studies have shown that induction of IL-6, and also other inflammatory and proteolytic factors, has an important role in muscle regenerative processes during hypertrophic conditions.32,33 In contrast, the role of inflammatory processes may be different in the elderly where an ibuprofen-induced downregulation of IL-6 could reduce chronic low-grade inflammation and thereby restore the blunted anabolic response to resistance exercise typically seen in aged populations.34 Thus, based on the current data and given the complex regulation of mRNA and protein levels,35,36 future studies should directly compare the response to resistance exercise and NSAID treatment in young vs. old populations as well as incorporate better time resolution, including both acute and chronic biopsy time points and perhaps also higher-throughput techniques, to provide more conclusive evidence of the critical mechanisms regulating the interactive effects of NSAIDs and resistance exercise on muscle adaptations. The functional data showed that increases in muscle strength were attenuated in IBU compared with ASA, but only in the FW leg. In our mind, this leads to two questions: first, if this strength difference was explained by the larger increase in muscle size in the control group, why was strength not reduced in the WS leg? Second, if not muscle size, what other mechanisms could explain the fact that strength was negatively affected by ibuprofen only in the FW leg? Regarding the first question, although muscle mass and strength are generally highly correlated at baseline in pre-training situations,37,38 the same does not necessarily apply when it comes to increases in strength and muscle size following short-term resistance training.39,40 This was also the case in the current study, where in fact the correlation between changes in muscle size and strength was very weak (R2 ~0.05; data not shown). Thus, it appears that strength gains can occur irrespective of the magnitude of increase in muscle volume and hence, this could explain why, in the WS leg, the larger increase in muscle volume for the ASA group did not result in a larger increase in strength compared with IBU. It is plausible that with longer-term training, once neural adaptations have plateaued,41 the relationship between muscle size and strength would be restored and hence the negative effect of ibuprofen on strength would be even more evident. As to the second question raised above, we did speculate beforehand that perhaps NSAID consumption could affect acute training performance and thereby the capacity to perform high-intensity repetitive work bouts. It appeared at first that the strength reduction in the FW leg was not related to a reduction in day-to-day training performance, as both groups performed an equal amount of work throughout the 8-week training programme. Interestingly, however, a closer look at the data in Figure 1 reveals that the ibuprofen group certainly showed a levelling-off effect during the last week of flywheel training, which likely explains the lower strength gains noted. Regarding the logical follow-up question of why training performance in the FW leg was negatively affected by ibuprofen only at the end of the training period, we are unable to provide a definite answer. However, given that the main differences between the two training modes is the eccentric overload, provoking greater inflammatory stimulus, and the maximal unlimited resistance provided by the flywheel device,21,42 it is tempting to speculate that one (or both) of these two features are particularly prone to ibuprofen treatment, at least after a few weeks of accumulated training. It should also be noted that day-to-day performance levels varied much more in the FW leg, indicating that this training regime was more stressful for the subjects. Alternatively, as indicated earlier, the relationship between muscle mass and strength became more important at the end of the training period, and hence, the levelling-off phenomenon in the IBU group was due to the compromised hypertrophic development. Altogether, based on the current data and given the knowledge of different time resolutions for the underlying mechanisms of muscle strength, longer training studies could clarify whether interference in muscle growth will be associated with reduced muscle strength, and whether different training modes, such as eccentric overload, are even more sensitive to concomitant NSAID treatment. Notwithstanding, our findings raise the concern that resistance-training studies employing strict work-matched increases across groups might overlook important effects of various factors such as medical treatments or supplements that would have become evident if maximal efforts had been allowed throughout each set and training session. In summary, we show for the first time that maximal over-the-counter doses of NSAIDs compromise resistance exercise-induced increases in muscle size and strength in young adults. The gains in muscle size were attenuated by ibuprofen independent of the type of training performed, whereas muscle strength was attenuated only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. Furthermore, while the resistance-training intervention resulted in several muscle molecular adaptations, the only marked difference across medical treatment was a significant ibuprofen-induced reduction in IL-6 gene expression, which in our mind reflected a changed inflammatory environment that, speculatively, contributed to the attenuated hypertrophic development in the ibuprofen group. This study improves our understanding of how NSAIDs work and interacts with chronic exercise responses, and considering the potency of the drug to modify muscle mass and function, the mechanistic findings should contribute to a better understanding of regulation of muscle growth in general. More importantly, however, the results have implications for the millions of individuals worldwide who consume NSAIDs on a regular basis while trying to obtain the best possible benefits of resistance training. 

","High doses of anti-inflammatory drugs compromise muscle strength and hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young adults.

Discussion 
The interest in this study was spurred by the intriguing observation that while NSAIDs might have a negative impact on acute exercise responses (satellite cell activity, translational signalling and protein synthesis), previous human studies have failed to demonstrate a detrimental effect of NSAIDs on the development of muscle hypertrophy in response to chronic resistance training in young adults, possibly due to differences in drug dosage across studies. Accordingly, in the current study, healthy young men and women performed 8 weeks of supervised resistance training with concomitant high- or low-dose NSAID treatment. The major and novel findings were that 1) maximal overthe-counter doses of ibuprofen compromised resistance exercise-induced muscle hypertropy
independent of training mode; 2) increases in muscle strength were attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions; 3) while the resistance-training intervention resulted in several muscle molecular adaptations, the only marked difference across medical treatment was a significant ibuprofen-induced downregulation of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 mRNA, compared with an upregulation in the ASA group. This is the first study showing that daily consumption of high doses of NSAIDs attenuates strength and muscle hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young healthy individuals. We acknowledge that a limitation of the current study was that we did not include a non-treated control group. However, the increase in muscle volume (7.5%) in the ASA group was of a similar, and expected, magnitude to that previously reported by our group20 and others.21,22 In the light of this, the magnitude of the reduction in muscle hypertrophy in response to the ibuprofen treatment was quite remarkable and, if anything, should the ASA treatment have had a small effect on the adaptive response, it would only have masked an even greater difference across groups than what is reported herein. Nonetheless, given the marked effect of ibuprofen and the fact that the increase in muscle size in the control group (0.14% per day) was of similar magnitude as the average rate of hypertrophy reported in past studies employing knee-extensor resistance training,23 we are confident that our data provide strong proof-of-principle evidence that the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent of the dose of intake. The rationale for using acetylsalicylic acid instead of ibuprofen as a low-dose comparator in the current study was based on the fact that when the drug is consumed orally, it undergoes substantial presystemic hydrolysis in the gut and liver before it enters the systemic bloodstream. As the drug will, however, encounter blood in the portal circulation, low doses of acetylsalicylic acid will exert its antiplatelet effect with no or limited effect on systemic targets such as peripheral tissue.1618 Consequently, the potential circulatory effects are factored out and we hypothesize that the negative effect of ibuprofen was due to muscle-specific COX inhibition rather than the antiplatelet effect achieved by both ibuprofen and low doses of acetylsalicylic acid.18,24 The results of the present study are in agreement with animal studies showing an inhibitory effect of COX inhibitors on muscle hypertrophy.8,9,25 They also agree with acute human data reporting attenuated protein synthesis,5 translational signalling13 and satellite cell activity11,12 in response to resistance training with concomitant high-dose NSAID administration. Our hypothesis of a dose-dependent effect is also supported by the only comparable training study in young healthy subjects.14 That particular study reported no effect of ibuprofen on muscle hypertrophy or strength gains after 6 weeks of training consisting of six sets of biceps curls 23 days week---------------1 . The drug dose was consumed on training days only, resulting in a total intake of 8001200 mg week---------------1 , 14 compared with 1200 mg per day in the current study. This indeed highlights the potential importance of drug dosage where, evidently, intake of maximal over-the-counter doses is potent enough to interfere with the normal hypertrophic development of 0.10.2% per day seen in the ASA group as well as in other studies employing conventional resistance-training programmes for the knee extensors.23 It is generally agreed that repeated increases in muscle protein synthesis following each exercise bout is the most important mechanism underlying training-induced muscle hypertrophy.26,27 Thus, it seems plausible to suggest that the main explanation for the clear attenuation of hypertrophy, which was evident in both training modes (FW and WS), was diminished prostaglandin production and hence decreased muscle protein synthetic response after each training session in the IBU group.

","Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women

DISCUSSION
This study examined the independent and combined effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in healthy eumenorrheic women, and the potential efficacy of acute water ingestion as a remedy to the deleterious impact of hypohydration. The main findings were that: 1) mild hypohydration increased pain sensitivity, 2) menstrual phase did not affect pain sensitivity, nor did it influence the effect of hypohydration on pain, and 3) acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity.

Hypohydration and Pain in Women
Independent of menstrual phase, mild hypohydration following 24 h of fluid restriction reduced pain tolerance (?8%) and increased pain intensity (+13%) and pain unpleasantness (+12%) ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (hereafter referred to as pain ratings) during ischemic pain stimulation, when compared with euhydration. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies that showed negative effects of mild hypohydration on experimental pain sensitivity in men (7, 8). Ogino et al. (7) observed a decrease in pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) following a combination of exercise-induced dehydration and fluid restriction, whereas Bear et al. (8) found an increase in pain intensity ratings but no difference in pain thresholds after 24 h of fluid restriction. Therefore, the current findings extend these previous results to women by showing that mild hypohydration also increases experimental pain sensitivity in women. The previous studies also did not include pain measures that reflect the affective/emotional experience of pain (i.e., pain tolerance or pain unpleasantness ratings) that may be important for chronic pain, whereas both pain threshold and pain intensity ratings assess the sensory/discriminative aspect of pain (49, 50). Although Bear et al. (8) measured pain tolerance, the nature of the stimulus-response relationship for the cold pressor taski.e., plateau and gradual decline in the perceived intensity of the pain stimulus (41)resulted in a large proportion (?2/3) of participants who were able to tolerate the pain until the 4-min cut-off time, thereby precluding meaningful analyses of the results. This issue was not apparent with the ischemic pain test used in the present study, as there was only one instance where the 20-min time limit was reached. Therefore, the current findings further add to the previous data by showing that mild hypohydration also negatively impacts the affective/emotional aspect of pain, as evidenced by the decrease in pain tolerance and increase in pain unpleasantness ratings compared with EUH.

The exact mechanisms underlying the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration cannot be determined from the current data. However, one potential mechanism through which hypohydration may increase pain sensitivity is thirst perception. Geuter et al. (51) showed that an increase in thirst perceptioninduced by consumption of salty snacks followed by 5 h of fluid deprivationled to an increase in pain intensity ratings during noxious heat stimulation, whereas subsequent ad libitum fluid intake, which reduced thirst perception, decreased pain ratings. In another study, stimulation of thirst sensation via hypertonic saline infusion increased pain intensity ratings during noxious pressure stimulation, which were associated with stronger activation of pain-related brain regions; namely, the anterior cingulate cortex and insula (52). Similar findings were reported in the study by Ogino et al. (7). These brain regions were previously shown to be activated and deactivated independently by an increase and decrease in thirst perception, respectively (5254). However, it is not apparent from these data whether the increased pain sensitivity and pain-related brain activity were due to thirst perception per se, physiological hypohydration, or both.

Menstrual Phase and Experimental Pain Sensitivity
Menstrual phase did not modulate the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration, nor did it independently affect pain sensitivity. The lack of a menstrual phase effect on ischemic pain sensitivity is consistent with the findings of most previous studies that examined ischemic pain responses across the menstrual cycle (18, 5558). In contrast, studies by Fillingim et al. (59) and Pfleeger et al. (60) observed greater pain sensitivity during the luteal compared with follicular phase. However, concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone were not measured in the study by Pfleeger et al. (60), whereas the specific definition of the luteal phase used by Fillingim et al. (59) differed from that in the current study. We examined the ML phase when concentrations of both 17?-estradiol and progesterone are elevated, whereas Fillingim et al. (59) included the late-luteal period in their classification of the luteal phase, during which concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone are declining rapidly and are less stable compared with the ML phase. Given that menstrual phases characterized by fluctuating or unstable 17?-estradiol levels have been associated with increased severity of various chronic pain conditions (14), this may explain why Fillingim et al. (59) observed phase differences in pain sensitivity whereas we did not.

The equivocal and inconclusive results regarding menstrual phase effects on experimental pain sensitivity are thought to be due, in part, to the lack of proper verification of menstrual phases through blood measurements of 17?-estradiol and progesterone (15, 16), making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relationship between menstrual phase/hormone status and pain sensitivity. Similar to previous observations (22, 23), Sosm was lower in the ML than EF phase (Table 2); however, this phase difference in hydration did not appear to impact any of the ischemic pain measures (Figs. 13). In this study, we showed that after hydration status was controlled, menstrual phases were properly verified and potential confounders (e.g., dietary and lifestyle factors and dysmenorrhea) were minimized, there was no difference in ischemic pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases. As such, our data suggest that the hormonal fluctuations within the menstrual cycle do not greatly impact pain sensitivity.

Interestingly, although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phase, there was a positive correlation between 17?-estradiol and pain sensitivity, suggesting that women with higher baseline levels of 17?-estradiol may be more sensitive to pain than those with lower 17?-estradiol levels (i.e., between-subject effect). However, given the weak strength of the correlation (r = ?0.32) (48), this finding should be interpreted with caution.

Effects of Acute Water Ingestion
Given that thirst perception may be a potential mechanism linking hypohydration and increased pain sensitivity, we hypothesized that acute water ingestion when hypohydrated would reduce pain sensitivity. This would also help to delineate the effects of thirst and hypohydration per se, on pain, since acute water ingestion would be expected to reduce thirst without altering hydration status (38, 61). However, contrary to our hypothesis, ischemic pain tolerance was not affected by ingestion of 5 mL·kg?1 of water, despite the significant decrease in thirst perception ratings. Meanwhile, ratings of both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness increased, which may appear counterintuitive as participants reported feeling more pain despite being less thirsty. These unexpected findings may be explained by carryover (sensitization) effects from the baseline pain test. A previous study showed that repeated pain stimulation within a single session produced a sensitization effect, whereby pain ratings increased gradually with each repeated stimulation (62). Therefore, this sensitization effect may have masked potential positive effects of acute water ingestion on pain. Future studies that either utilize a longer interval between the repeated pain tests, or perform the postwater ingestion pain test on a separate day, are required to gain further understanding on the relative importance of thirst perception and physiological hypohydration on pain.

Considerations
There are several considerations and limitations of this study that should be noted in addition to those already discussed earlier. First, only healthy, eumenorrheic women were included in this study, which ignores postmenopausal women and oral contraceptive pill users, who have different hormonal profiles compared with eumenorrheic women. Therefore, it is possible that hypohydration may affect pain sensitivity differently in these women compared with eumenorrheic women. Second, blood samples were not obtained after water ingestion to confirm that hydration status was not altered. However, previous data indicate that consuming a moderate volume of water, similar to that in the current study, does not acutely alter hydration status in hypohydrated men (38, 61). In addition, the relatively short interval of 30 min between water ingestion and the subsequent pain test was likely insufficient for hydration status to be altered, because a previous study showed that at least 75 min is required for 300 mL of water to be completely absorbed into the bloodstream (63). Third, as participants could not be blinded to the hydration intervention, the increased pain sensitivity observed during HYPO may have been confounded by nocebo effects (64, 65). Although participants were not aware of the study hypotheses, they were aware of the aims of the study, one of which was to investigate the effects of hypohydration on pain sensitivity. Given the negative connotations of hypohydration or dehydration, it is conceivable that participants would expect hypohydration to increase pain sensitivity, which may have subsequently influenced participants actual responses to the ischemic pain test. Fourth, the body mass change values in HYPO may not accurately reflect the fluid losses induced by the 24 h of fluid restriction. Due to the scheduling constraints that included two experimental visits within 3 days per menstrual phase, we were unable to obtain a baseline body mass at the start of the hydration intervention; thus, body mass change in HYPO was calculated using EUH body mass. As the EUH and HYPO trials within each menstrual phase were separated by at least 48 h, it is likely that the values were confounded by factors other than the change in body water content (e.g., urine and fecal losses, food and fluid consumption). Acknowledging this limitation, we obtained other measures of hydration status (i.e., Sosm, USG, copeptin, and thirst ratings) in addition to body mass change for a more accurate assessment of hydrations status. Finally, our sample size may have limited our ability to detect statistically significant menstrual phase effects on pain. As such, the effects of menstrual phase on pain require further investigation. Our study could provide a reference for future studies with a similar design to base their sample size calculations on. Nevertheless, large effect sizes (?2p
 = 0.370.55) were obtained for the main effect of hypohydration on pain, with an observed power of 0.70.9, which suggests a low probability of false negatives.

Perspectives and Significance
Our data indicate that hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women and this effect may not be reversed immediately by water ingestion. Whereas, menstrual phase (EF vs. ML) does not appear to affect pain sensitivity. These findings suggest that insufficient water intake throughout the day may exacerbate pain perception in healthy women. Given the high prevalence of hypohydration among the general population (25), future studies should investigate whether hypohydration may worsen chronic pain conditions, and the potential efficacy of maintaining adequate hydration in alleviating pain symptoms. This may be especially important for older adults, who are more likely to be hypohydrated and experience chronic pain (25, 66). For human pain researchers, controlling or measuring hydration status of participants may be important to minimize confound, as clinically and physiologically relevant tests such as the cold pressor are affected (67). Although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases after controlling for hydration status, more high-quality research is required to accurately determine whether menstrual phase does or does not affect pain sensitivity. Therefore, until a consensus on the topic has been reached, our data do not discount the need for future pain researchers to verify menstrual phase.

The lack of a menstrual phase effect on ischemic pain sensitivity is consistent with the findings of most previous studies that examined ischemic pain responses across the menstrual cycle (18, 5558). In contrast, studies by Fillingim et al. (59) and Pfleeger et al. (60) observed greater pain sensitivity during the luteal compared with follicular phase. However, concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone were not measured in the study by Pfleeger et al. (60), whereas the specific definition of the luteal phase used by Fillingim et al. (59) differed from that in the current study. We examined the ML phase when concentrations of both 17?-estradiol and progesterone are elevated, whereas Fillingim et al. (59) included the late-luteal period in their classification of the luteal phase, during which concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone are declining rapidly and are less stable compared with the ML phase. Given that menstrual phases characterized by fluctuating or unstable 17?-estradiol levels have been associated with increased severity of various chronic pain conditions (14), this may explain why Fillingim et al. (59) observed phase differences in pain sensitivity whereas we did not.

The equivocal and inconclusive results regarding menstrual phase effects on experimental pain sensitivity are thought to be due, in part, to the lack of proper verification of menstrual phases through blood measurements of 17?-estradiol and progesterone (15, 16), making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relationship between menstrual phase/hormone status and pain sensitivity. Similar to previous observations (22, 23), Sosm was lower in the ML than EF phase (Table 2); however, this phase difference in hydration did not appear to impact any of the ischemic pain measures (Figs. 13). In this study, we showed that after hydration status was controlled, menstrual phases were properly verified and potential confounders (e.g., dietary and lifestyle factors and dysmenorrhea) were minimized, there was no difference in ischemic pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases. As such, our data suggest that the hormonal fluctuations within the menstrual cycle do not greatly impact pain sensitivity.

Interestingly, although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phase, there was a positive correlation between 17?-estradiol and pain sensitivity, suggesting that women with higher baseline levels of 17?-estradiol may be more sensitive to pain than those with lower 17?-estradiol levels (i.e., between-subject effect). However, given the weak strength of the correlation (r = ?0.32) (48), this finding should be interpreted with caution.

Effects of Acute Water Ingestion
Given that thirst perception may be a potential mechanism linking hypohydration and increased pain sensitivity, we hypothesized that acute water ingestion when hypohydrated would reduce pain sensitivity. This would also help to delineate the effects of thirst and hypohydration per se, on pain, since acute water ingestion would be expected to reduce thirst without altering hydration status (38, 61). However, contrary to our hypothesis, ischemic pain tolerance was not affected by ingestion of 5 mL·kg?1 of water, despite the significant decrease in thirst perception ratings. Meanwhile, ratings of both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness increased, which may appear counterintuitive as participants reported feeling more pain despite being less thirsty. These unexpected findings may be explained by carryover (sensitization) effects from the baseline pain test. A previous study showed that repeated pain stimulation within a single session produced a sensitization effect, whereby pain ratings increased gradually with each repeated stimulation (62). Therefore, this sensitization effect may have masked potential positive effects of acute water ingestion on pain. Future studies that either utilize a longer interval between the repeated pain tests, or perform the postwater ingestion pain test on a separate day, are required to gain further understanding on the relative importance of thirst perception and physiological hypohydration on pain.

Considerations
There are several considerations and limitations of this study that should be noted in addition to those already discussed earlier. First, only healthy, eumenorrheic women were included in this study, which ignores postmenopausal women and oral contraceptive pill users, who have different hormonal profiles compared with eumenorrheic women. Therefore, it is possible that hypohydration may affect pain sensitivity differently in these women compared with eumenorrheic women. Second, blood samples were not obtained after water ingestion to confirm that hydration status was not altered. However, previous data indicate that consuming a moderate volume of water, similar to that in the current study, does not acutely alter hydration status in hypohydrated men (38, 61). In addition, the relatively short interval of 30 min between water ingestion and the subsequent pain test was likely insufficient for hydration status to be altered, because a previous study showed that at least 75 min is required for 300 mL of water to be completely absorbed into the bloodstream (63). Third, as participants could not be blinded to the hydration intervention, the increased pain sensitivity observed during HYPO may have been confounded by nocebo effects (64, 65). Although participants were not aware of the study hypotheses, they were aware of the aims of the study, one of which was to investigate the effects of hypohydration on pain sensitivity. Given the negative connotations of hypohydration or dehydration, it is conceivable that participants would expect hypohydration to increase pain sensitivity, which may have subsequently influenced participants actual responses to the ischemic pain test. Fourth, the body mass change values in HYPO may not accurately reflect the fluid losses induced by the 24 h of fluid restriction. Due to the scheduling constraints that included two experimental visits within 3 days per menstrual phase, we were unable to obtain a baseline body mass at the start of the hydration intervention; thus, body mass change in HYPO was calculated using EUH body mass. As the EUH and HYPO trials within each menstrual phase were separated by at least 48 h, it is likely that the values were confounded by factors other than the change in body water content (e.g., urine and fecal losses, food and fluid consumption). Acknowledging this limitation, we obtained other measures of hydration status (i.e., Sosm, USG, copeptin, and thirst ratings) in addition to body mass change for a more accurate assessment of hydrations status. Finally, our sample size may have limited our ability to detect statistically significant menstrual phase effects on pain. As such, the effects of menstrual phase on pain require further investigation. Our study could provide a reference for future studies with a similar design to base their sample size calculations on. Nevertheless, large effect sizes (?2p
 = 0.370.55) were obtained for the main effect of hypohydration on pain, with an observed power of 0.70.9, which suggests a low probability of false negatives.

Perspectives and Significance
Our data indicate that hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women and this effect may not be reversed immediately by water ingestion. Whereas, menstrual phase (EF vs. ML) does not appear to affect pain sensitivity. These findings suggest that insufficient water intake throughout the day may exacerbate pain perception in healthy women. Given the high prevalence of hypohydration among the general population (25), future studies should investigate whether hypohydration may worsen chronic pain conditions, and the potential efficacy of maintaining adequate hydration in alleviating pain symptoms. This may be especially important for older adults, who are more likely to be hypohydrated and experience chronic pain (25, 66). For human pain researchers, controlling or measuring hydration status of participants may be important to minimize confound, as clinically and physiologically relevant tests such as the cold pressor are affected (67). Although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases after controlling for hydration status, more high-quality research is required to accurately determine whether menstrual phase does or does not affect pain sensitivity. Therefore, until a consensus on the topic has been reached, our data do not discount the need for future pain researchers to verify menstrual phase.
