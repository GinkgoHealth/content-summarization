response_01,Scientists found that people who regularly do strength training have faster and stronger muscles than those who do not. They measured something called muscle fiber conduction velocity (MFCV) during explosive force contractions and found that the strength-trained group had higher MFCV and could recruit larger motor units in a shorter amount of time. This means they could generate more force faster. The study suggests that training can improve the neural strategies of muscle control and lead to better explosive force performance.,"Resistance-trained individuals have been found to have higher explosive torque and early rate of torque development than untrained individuals. This is due to the recruitment of motor units with greater conduction velocities, which allows for the faster development of peak mechanical torques in a shorter time.

I just read this really interesting study about how strength training can affect our muscles' ability to generate explosive force. Basically, the researchers found that people who were regularly strength-trained were able to generate more force in the first 50 milliseconds of a contraction compared to people who weren't trained. This was because they were able to recruit bigger muscle fibers with faster conduction velocities more quickly. It's really fascinating because this is the first study to show this kind of thing! It's important because it can help us understand how our muscles work and how to train them to be more explosive.","This article talks about how exercise affects our appetite and how much we eat. Studies have shown that people who exercise more have better control over their hunger and eat less. Exercise can also change how our body responds to hormones that make us feel full after eating. However, the type of food we eat is also important. Eating high-fat foods can make us eat more, even if we exercise a lot. This research can help us understand how to stay healthy and control our appetite.","Regular exercise can influence our appetite control mechanisms, leading to better hormonal satiety signaling and sensitivity to hunger and satiety cues. However, the impact can vary depending on the level of physical activity and body composition. Studies show that physically active individuals are better able to compensate for the energy they consume, but diet composition is also important. A high-fat, energy-dense diet can lead to overconsumption of energy, regardless of physical activity level.

So, I read this article about how exercise and physical activity can affect our appetite and how much we eat. Basically, when we exercise, our body releases certain hormones that make us feel full and satisfied after we eat. This can help us control our appetite and not overeat. However, if we eat foods that are high in fat and calories, even if we exercise, we might still end up eating too much and gaining weight. The article also talks about how everyone's body is different, and what works for one person might not work for another. So, it's important to find a balance between exercise and eating healthy foods to keep our body in good shape.","Hey there! I just read an interesting scientific article about how physical activity can affect our appetite and eating behavior. The article talks about how our body has different mechanisms that control our appetite, and how physical activity can impact these mechanisms. 

One interesting point is that individuals with low levels of physical activity tend to have a non-regulated appetite, meaning they may have trouble controlling how much they eat. On the other hand, those with higher levels of physical activity tend to have a more regulated appetite, meaning they have more sensitive hunger and fullness signals. 

Another interesting point is that physical activity can affect our appetite in two different ways: it can increase our drive to eat due to burning more calories, but it can also enhance our satiety response to food. This means that physically active individuals may be better at matching their food intake to their energy needs.

However, the article also highlights the importance of diet composition. Eating a high-fat, energy-dense diet can lead to overconsumption of calories, regardless of physical activity level. 

Overall, the article suggests that the impact of physical activity on appetite control is not a ""one size fits all"" approach, and that more research is needed to fully understand how different factors like body composition, sex, and age can affect the relationship between physical activity and appetite."

text,"Higher muscle fiber conduction velocity and early rate of torque development in chronically strength-trained individuals
DISCUSSION
MFCV was measured during explosive force contractions in a group of resistance-trained individuals and a control cohort. ST exhibited greater explosive torque, early RTD, and greater MFCV with respect to controls throughout the contraction. When explosive torque was normalized to maximal torque, ST had a higher RTD at the beginning of the contraction (0–50 ms). Moreover, a greater absolute and normalized conduction velocity (MFCVMAX) during the EMD and in the first 50 ms of torque generation was observed for the ST group. This result indicates a recruitment of motor units with greater conduction velocities. This is the first study showing that ST may recruit larger motor units in a shorter amount of time.

Muscle Fiber Conduction Velocity
The average MFCV values are in agreement with previous reports of MFCV during steady-state contractions. For example, Farina et al. reported estimates of MFCV in the BB during isometric steady-state contractions at 50% MVC of ~4.6 m/s (30). Zwarts and Arendt-Nielsen estimated MFCV at high contraction forces of the BB and reported values ranging between 3.22 and 5.11 m/s (57). MFCV average values in the present study were also in agreement with estimates of single-motor unit conduction velocities using intramuscular EMG recordings during voluntary and electrical activation of the BB muscle. Moreover, the present estimates are also in accordance with other studies involving different muscular contractions and protocols (25, 26, 32, 41, 42, 47, 48).

Interestingly, only two studies assessed MFCV in power athletes and only during electrical stimulation and maximal voluntary contractions (43, 49). Sadoyama et al. reported a significantly higher maximal MFCV in a group of trained sprinters compared with endurance runners (4.84 vs. 4.31 m/s; 49). Moreover, they reported a significant relation between the relative area of fast-twitch fibers and conduction velocity (49).

Recently, Methenitis et al. estimated MFCV during electrical stimulation of muscle fibers in endurance runners and power-trained and ST individuals and separately measured RTD (43). They reported significant relations between MFCV, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and rate of force development (43). However, estimates of MFCV were assessed during electrical stimulation and thus separately from the voluntary generation of explosive force. Therefore, it was not possible to associate the underlying neural strategies of muscle control with explosive force performance. Collectively, these previous results indicate that MFCV may be an indicator of muscle explosive performance, although no previous study assessed MFCV during explosive torque generation.

Explosive Torque and RTD
The RTD was significantly greater for ST during the early phase of explosive torque generation (Fig. 3A). However, when the moment-time curve was normalized to the maximal strength, the RTD for the resistance-trained subjects was significantly different only in the first 50 ms of the contraction (Fig. 3B). Because the relative explosive torque at 150 and 200 ms from contraction onset was similar between the two groups, the controls developed higher RTD during the second and third time windows from force onset (Fig. 3B).

Previous studies found an increase in the EMG amplitude and rate of force development in the initial phase of contraction after 4 wk of explosive training (7). In addition, a greater normalized rate of force development in the first 50 ms of contraction was found for power athletes during knee extensor explosive torque (51). Because the first 50 ms of contraction strongly reflect neural activation (13, 15, 16, 54), strength or power training presumably increases RTD by a faster recruitment of motor units, as discussed below.

MFCV During the Explosive Phase of Contraction
ST individuals have the ability to develop higher levels of force in the first 50 ms of contraction. This seems to be associated with greater MFCV in the same time interval, which indicates recruitment of motor units with greater conduction velocity. The role of motor unit recruitment during explosive force contraction is not well understood because it is not possible to identify representative populations of motor units in very short time intervals.

The primary determinant of motor unit twitch force is the number of muscle fibers innervated by the axon (17, 53). Motor unit peak twitch forces in humans range from ~6 to ~78 mN·m with maximal tetanic forces ranging from ~30 to ~200 mN·m (36, 38). Therefore, one of the mechanisms that determined the increase in RTD during the first 0–50-ms interval in the ST may have been the recruitment of larger motor units with greater and faster twitches. There is evidence showing correlations between electrically evoked twitch torque and early voluntary rate of force development, which could be associated with the differences in muscle fiber composition and/or Ca2+ saturation for the trained individuals (3, 34).

Interestingly, the two groups showed similar EMD values, which is in accordance with a previous study that compared the EMD in power-trained and untrained cohorts (51). This finding is, however, contradictory with a higher MFCV during the EMD. A higher absolute MFCV value should theoretically anticipate the release of Ca2+ and thus the rise in force. However, these problems may be related to the techniques employed in assessing the delay between the neural and muscular apparatus. The EMD during explosive contractions may not be sensitive to differences in neural activation due to a compressed recruitment (12, 15). We have recently shown that when the EMD is assessed as the time difference between the neural drive and force during the sustained contractions, the central nervous system modulates the delay broadly and according to the rate of force development (12). Indeed, the neuromechanical delay seems to be predominantly influenced by the type of recruited motor units and the intrinsic properties of the motor neuron (5, 12). Future studies assessing the neuromechanical delay in strength/power-trained individuals may be warranted.

MFCV increases with voluntary force production due to the relation between motor unit recruitment thresholds and fiber diameter (4, 8, 11, 35). This association implies that the ordered recruitment of motor units may be assessed by estimates of conduction velocity (10). We have recently reported that large, high-threshold motor units innervate fibers with large diameter (11), which explains the association between motor unit mechanical properties and conduction velocity previously reported (4). Moreover, we have recently demonstrated that the increase in average MFCV during voluntary force contractions is associated with the progressive recruitment of motor units with increasing conduction velocity and predicts recruitment thresholds at the individual subject level (10).

In the present study, MFCV was the average of the conduction velocities of the active motor units during explosive force contractions, in time intervals of 50 ms following EMG onset. We showed that there may be significant differences in the recruited motor units during explosive tasks in ST compared with moderately active individuals. Absolute MFCV values were greater in ST throughout the full duration of the explosive contractions (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the early absolute and normalized MFCV were positively associated with RTD (Fig. 4). Because absolute MFCV values are linearly related to the diameters of muscle fibers, higher absolute conduction velocity values may indicate that ST have muscle fibers with larger diameters due to the strength training-induced hypertrophy (43) compared with controls (24, 43).

However, when MFCV values were normalized to the maximal value during MVF (full motor unit recruitment), ST had a significantly greater MFCV-rel during the initial phase of the explosive contractions. Specifically, MFCV-relEMD and MFCV-rel0–50 were on average ~9% greater (Fig. 4B). This suggests that during the early phase of explosive force, ST have the ability to recruit motor units with faster conduction velocities in a shorter time. It takes ~100 ms more for the controls to reach similar values of normalized MFCV compared with the ST group. Interestingly, the changes in conduction velocity did not differ between groups (Fig. 4, A and B), and the MFCV plateaued in the interval 50–100 ms, which can be interpreted as full motor unit recruitment (10). This interpretation is in agreement with previous studies reporting that most motor units are recruited at one-third of maximal force during explosive contractions (15, 16). Moreover, MFCV increased in all subjects from the EMD to 0–50 ms, indicating that the ordered recruitment according to the size of the motor unit was preserved during the explosive tasks in both groups.

The underlying mechanism that may determine an increase in explosive force for the ST individuals may be an anticipated recruitment of high-threshold motor units with high conduction velocities. The difference between MFCV of high- and low-threshold motor units within a muscle is ~2 m/s (11). A faster motor unit recruitment (and conduction velocity) would achieve greater peak mechanical torques in a shorter time. The release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is correlated to the speed of the action potential on the fiber membrane (21). Indeed, MFCV is related to motor unit time-to-peak twitch forces (4). The increase in MFCV may potentially allow a faster calcium uptake and thus anticipating the rise in force.

Van Cutsem et al. reported an increase in motor unit discharge rates following ballistic training (55) and concluded, in agreement with other studies, that RTD depends on motor unit discharge rate (16, 18, 55). On the other hand, the recruitment threshold of motor units significantly influences the discharge rate at a given absolute force (18). Anticipating the recruitment of high-threshold motor units would result in reaching motor unit peak discharge rate and motor unit peak RTD in a shorter time. Accordingly, in the present study, MFCV was positively associated with RTD (Fig. 4A), suggesting that motor unit recruitment may play an important role in explosive force production.

Interestingly, the correlation between RTD0–50 and early MFCV values (MFCVEMD,0–50) was different for the ST and untrained individuals. MFCV0–50 was not correlated with RTD0–50 in the ST group (Fig. 4). This result indicates that ST completed the motor unit recruitment during the very early phase of explosive force, i.e., between the EMD and the first 50 ms from contraction onset (Fig. 4B). The increase in MFCV during the explosive force at the 50- and 100-ms time points for the ST is presumably due to some subjects continuing the recruitment while the subjects with higher RTD achieved a faster plateau in MFCV (Fig. 4). Indeed, it took more time for the untrained individuals to reach high MFCV (and full motor unit recruitment) values (Figs. 3 and 4).

It must be noted that the number of subjects in the present study may be too low for a correlation study. Moreover, the cross-sectional design cannot isolate the innate and environmental factors that contributed to the explosive force and MFCV differences found between the cohorts. However, in the present study the trained individuals performed combined strength and explosive training for >3 yr. Recent evidence showed a significant increase in explosive force production after 12 wk of isometric explosive training compared with isometric sustained-contraction strength training (6). The large differences in the early RTD for the trained subjects in the present study may also indicate that the neural contributors to explosive strength could be related to chronic exposure to explosive/strength training and that the neural adaptations may continue over time. Future studies assessing the neural contributors to explosive force in large cohorts and longitudinal (>1 yr) interventions are warranted.

Conclusion
Resistance-trained individuals showed higher RTD and explosive force in the very early phase of contraction that was accompanied by an increase in absolute and normalized MFCV compared with controls. These observations may be explained by recruitment of fast-twitch motor units (i.e., large motor units with large muscle fiber diameters) in a shorter amount of time in the resistance-trained cohort than in controls. In addition to the functional implications in the study of human explosive force, the study also presents a methodology that may be applied in the assessment of the neural strategies of muscle control in health, training, and pathology.
","Higher muscle fiber conduction velocity and early rate of torque development in chronically strength-trained individuals
DISCUSSION
MFCV was measured during explosive force contractions in a group of resistance-trained individuals and a control cohort. ST exhibited greater explosive torque, early RTD, and greater MFCV with respect to controls throughout the contraction. When explosive torque was normalized to maximal torque, ST had a higher RTD at the beginning of the contraction (0–50 ms). Moreover, a greater absolute and normalized conduction velocity (MFCVMAX) during the EMD and in the first 50 ms of torque generation was observed for the ST group. This result indicates a recruitment of motor units with greater conduction velocities. This is the first study showing that ST may recruit larger motor units in a shorter amount of time.

Muscle Fiber Conduction Velocity
The average MFCV values are in agreement with previous reports of MFCV during steady-state contractions. For example, Farina et al. reported estimates of MFCV in the BB during isometric steady-state contractions at 50% MVC of ~4.6 m/s (30). Zwarts and Arendt-Nielsen estimated MFCV at high contraction forces of the BB and reported values ranging between 3.22 and 5.11 m/s (57). MFCV average values in the present study were also in agreement with estimates of single-motor unit conduction velocities using intramuscular EMG recordings during voluntary and electrical activation of the BB muscle. Moreover, the present estimates are also in accordance with other studies involving different muscular contractions and protocols (25, 26, 32, 41, 42, 47, 48).

Interestingly, only two studies assessed MFCV in power athletes and only during electrical stimulation and maximal voluntary contractions (43, 49). Sadoyama et al. reported a significantly higher maximal MFCV in a group of trained sprinters compared with endurance runners (4.84 vs. 4.31 m/s; 49). Moreover, they reported a significant relation between the relative area of fast-twitch fibers and conduction velocity (49).

Recently, Methenitis et al. estimated MFCV during electrical stimulation of muscle fibers in endurance runners and power-trained and ST individuals and separately measured RTD (43). They reported significant relations between MFCV, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and rate of force development (43). However, estimates of MFCV were assessed during electrical stimulation and thus separately from the voluntary generation of explosive force. Therefore, it was not possible to associate the underlying neural strategies of muscle control with explosive force performance. Collectively, these previous results indicate that MFCV may be an indicator of muscle explosive performance, although no previous study assessed MFCV during explosive torque generation.

Explosive Torque and RTD
The RTD was significantly greater for ST during the early phase of explosive torque generation (Fig. 3A). However, when the moment-time curve was normalized to the maximal strength, the RTD for the resistance-trained subjects was significantly different only in the first 50 ms of the contraction (Fig. 3B). Because the relative explosive torque at 150 and 200 ms from contraction onset was similar between the two groups, the controls developed higher RTD during the second and third time windows from force onset (Fig. 3B).

Previous studies found an increase in the EMG amplitude and rate of force development in the initial phase of contraction after 4 wk of explosive training (7). In addition, a greater normalized rate of force development in the first 50 ms of contraction was found for power athletes during knee extensor explosive torque (51). Because the first 50 ms of contraction strongly reflect neural activation (13, 15, 16, 54), strength or power training presumably increases RTD by a faster recruitment of motor units, as discussed below.

MFCV During the Explosive Phase of Contraction
ST individuals have the ability to develop higher levels of force in the first 50 ms of contraction. This seems to be associated with greater MFCV in the same time interval, which indicates recruitment of motor units with greater conduction velocity. The role of motor unit recruitment during explosive force contraction is not well understood because it is not possible to identify representative populations of motor units in very short time intervals.

The primary determinant of motor unit twitch force is the number of muscle fibers innervated by the axon (17, 53). Motor unit peak twitch forces in humans range from ~6 to ~78 mN·m with maximal tetanic forces ranging from ~30 to ~200 mN·m (36, 38). Therefore, one of the mechanisms that determined the increase in RTD during the first 0–50-ms interval in the ST may have been the recruitment of larger motor units with greater and faster twitches. There is evidence showing correlations between electrically evoked twitch torque and early voluntary rate of force development, which could be associated with the differences in muscle fiber composition and/or Ca2+ saturation for the trained individuals (3, 34).

Interestingly, the two groups showed similar EMD values, which is in accordance with a previous study that compared the EMD in power-trained and untrained cohorts (51). This finding is, however, contradictory with a higher MFCV during the EMD. A higher absolute MFCV value should theoretically anticipate the release of Ca2+ and thus the rise in force. However, these problems may be related to the techniques employed in assessing the delay between the neural and muscular apparatus. The EMD during explosive contractions may not be sensitive to differences in neural activation due to a compressed recruitment (12, 15). We have recently shown that when the EMD is assessed as the time difference between the neural drive and force during the sustained contractions, the central nervous system modulates the delay broadly and according to the rate of force development (12). Indeed, the neuromechanical delay seems to be predominantly influenced by the type of recruited motor units and the intrinsic properties of the motor neuron (5, 12). Future studies assessing the neuromechanical delay in strength/power-trained individuals may be warranted.

MFCV increases with voluntary force production due to the relation between motor unit recruitment thresholds and fiber diameter (4, 8, 11, 35). This association implies that the ordered recruitment of motor units may be assessed by estimates of conduction velocity (10). We have recently reported that large, high-threshold motor units innervate fibers with large diameter (11), which explains the association between motor unit mechanical properties and conduction velocity previously reported (4). Moreover, we have recently demonstrated that the increase in average MFCV during voluntary force contractions is associated with the progressive recruitment of motor units with increasing conduction velocity and predicts recruitment thresholds at the individual subject level (10).

In the present study, MFCV was the average of the conduction velocities of the active motor units during explosive force contractions, in time intervals of 50 ms following EMG onset. We showed that there may be significant differences in the recruited motor units during explosive tasks in ST compared with moderately active individuals. Absolute MFCV values were greater in ST throughout the full duration of the explosive contractions (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the early absolute and normalized MFCV were positively associated with RTD (Fig. 4). Because absolute MFCV values are linearly related to the diameters of muscle fibers, higher absolute conduction velocity values may indicate that ST have muscle fibers with larger diameters due to the strength training-induced hypertrophy (43) compared with controls (24, 43).

However, when MFCV values were normalized to the maximal value during MVF (full motor unit recruitment), ST had a significantly greater MFCV-rel during the initial phase of the explosive contractions. Specifically, MFCV-relEMD and MFCV-rel0–50 were on average ~9% greater (Fig. 4B). This suggests that during the early phase of explosive force, ST have the ability to recruit motor units with faster conduction velocities in a shorter time. It takes ~100 ms more for the controls to reach similar values of normalized MFCV compared with the ST group. Interestingly, the changes in conduction velocity did not differ between groups (Fig. 4, A and B), and the MFCV plateaued in the interval 50–100 ms, which can be interpreted as full motor unit recruitment (10). This interpretation is in agreement with previous studies reporting that most motor units are recruited at one-third of maximal force during explosive contractions (15, 16). Moreover, MFCV increased in all subjects from the EMD to 0–50 ms, indicating that the ordered recruitment according to the size of the motor unit was preserved during the explosive tasks in both groups.

The underlying mechanism that may determine an increase in explosive force for the ST individuals may be an anticipated recruitment of high-threshold motor units with high conduction velocities. The difference between MFCV of high- and low-threshold motor units within a muscle is ~2 m/s (11). A faster motor unit recruitment (and conduction velocity) would achieve greater peak mechanical torques in a shorter time. The release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is correlated to the speed of the action potential on the fiber membrane (21). Indeed, MFCV is related to motor unit time-to-peak twitch forces (4). The increase in MFCV may potentially allow a faster calcium uptake and thus anticipating the rise in force.

Van Cutsem et al. reported an increase in motor unit discharge rates following ballistic training (55) and concluded, in agreement with other studies, that RTD depends on motor unit discharge rate (16, 18, 55). On the other hand, the recruitment threshold of motor units significantly influences the discharge rate at a given absolute force (18). Anticipating the recruitment of high-threshold motor units would result in reaching motor unit peak discharge rate and motor unit peak RTD in a shorter time. Accordingly, in the present study, MFCV was positively associated with RTD (Fig. 4A), suggesting that motor unit recruitment may play an important role in explosive force production.

Interestingly, the correlation between RTD0–50 and early MFCV values (MFCVEMD,0–50) was different for the ST and untrained individuals. MFCV0–50 was not correlated with RTD0–50 in the ST group (Fig. 4). This result indicates that ST completed the motor unit recruitment during the very early phase of explosive force, i.e., between the EMD and the first 50 ms from contraction onset (Fig. 4B). The increase in MFCV during the explosive force at the 50- and 100-ms time points for the ST is presumably due to some subjects continuing the recruitment while the subjects with higher RTD achieved a faster plateau in MFCV (Fig. 4). Indeed, it took more time for the untrained individuals to reach high MFCV (and full motor unit recruitment) values (Figs. 3 and 4).

It must be noted that the number of subjects in the present study may be too low for a correlation study. Moreover, the cross-sectional design cannot isolate the innate and environmental factors that contributed to the explosive force and MFCV differences found between the cohorts. However, in the present study the trained individuals performed combined strength and explosive training for >3 yr. Recent evidence showed a significant increase in explosive force production after 12 wk of isometric explosive training compared with isometric sustained-contraction strength training (6). The large differences in the early RTD for the trained subjects in the present study may also indicate that the neural contributors to explosive strength could be related to chronic exposure to explosive/strength training and that the neural adaptations may continue over time. Future studies assessing the neural contributors to explosive force in large cohorts and longitudinal (>1 yr) interventions are warranted.

Conclusion
Resistance-trained individuals showed higher RTD and explosive force in the very early phase of contraction that was accompanied by an increase in absolute and normalized MFCV compared with controls. These observations may be explained by recruitment of fast-twitch motor units (i.e., large motor units with large muscle fiber diameters) in a shorter amount of time in the resistance-trained cohort than in controls.

However, in the present study the trained individuals performed combined strength and explosive training for >3 yr. Recent evidence showed a significant increase in explosive force production after 12 wk of isometric explosive training compared with isometric sustained-contraction strength training (6). The large differences in the early RTD for the trained subjects in the present study may also indicate that the neural contributors to explosive strength could be related to chronic exposure to explosive/strength training and that the neural adaptations may continue over time. Future studies assessing the neural contributors to explosive force in large cohorts and longitudinal (>1 yr) interventions are warranted.

Conclusion
Resistance-trained individuals showed higher RTD and explosive force in the very early phase of contraction that was accompanied by an increase in absolute and normalized MFCV compared with controls. These observations may be explained by recruitment of fast-twitch motor units (i.e., large motor units with large muscle fiber diameters) in a shorter amount of time in the resistance-trained cohort than in controls. In addition to the functional implications in the study of human explosive force, the study also presents a methodology that may be applied in the assessment of the neural strategies of muscle control in health, training, and pathology.
","Homeostatic and non-homeostatic appetite control along the spectrum of physical activity levels an updated perspective

284 5. The impact of physical activity and exercise on the mechanisms of appetite control 
285 Emerging studies are shedding light on the mechanisms contributing to the proposed 
286 dysregulation of appetite at lower levels of PA and more sensitive appetite control at higher 
287 levels of PA. These mechanisms may not necessarily be the same along the whole spectrum 
288 of PA levels. Acutely, exercise has been shown to influence gastric emptying [78], attenuate 
289 the release of ghrelin and increase the secretion of PYY, GLP-1 and pancreatic polypeptide 
290 [79]. Chronic exercise may increase the postprandial secretion of GLP-1 and PYY [80]. 
291 Therefore, habitual PA (and exercise) may interact with food intake to enhance hormonal 
292 satiety signalling [81]. Moreover, regular PA and exercise training are associated with several 
293 other physiological adaptations such as improved sensitivity to insulin [82] and leptin [83, 84], 
294 substrate metabolism [85], and body composition [86], which have been proposed as 
295 mechanisms involved in food intake and eating behaviour [87, 88]. Evidence suggests that PA 
296 influences appetite control through a dual-process action which increases the drive to eat but 
297 also post-meal satiety [89]. Several studies have now demonstrated that physically active 
298 individuals show better energy compensation than their less active counterparts following 
299 consumption of preloads differing in energy content such that they reduce EI to offset the 
300 difference in energy consumed from the preloads [10, 90-94]. This preload-test meal paradigm 
301 is effective in measuring the strength of satiety [95]. These improvements in satiety may be 
302 associated with exercise-induced adaptations in episodic satiety signalling [80, 91, 96] or
303 gastric emptying [97]. In contrast, we have shown that satiation does not appear to be 
14
304 influenced by PA level in non-obese individuals when measured with a passive 
305 overconsumption paradigm comparing ad libitum EI at meals high in fat or carbohydrate [9]. 
306 However, in overweight and obese individuals, Caudwell et al. [1] showed that exercise 
307 training led to a reduction in EI at a high-fat/energy dense test meal. This may be associated 
308 with enhanced satiation, but given the homeostatic and non-homeostatic determinants of food 
309 intake, may also reflect changes in food hedonics or behavioural traits. 
310 While there is strong support that habitual PA affects homeostatic mechanisms 
311 controlling food intake, less is known on its effect on non-homeostatic processes, and their 
312 contribution to appetite control along the spectrum of PA levels. Indeed, secondary analyses 
313 from the study from Caudwell et al. [1] revealed a reduction in hedonic wanting for high-fat 
314 foods relative to low-fat foods (Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire), disinhibition and binge 
315 eating following exercise training [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. Furthermore, another 
316 study from our group found inverse associations between time spent in MVPA and disinhibition 
317 and binge eating, but these did not remain significant after controlling for body fat [24]. This 
318 corroborates a study by Shook et al. who found greater disinhibition in their lowest quintile of 
319 MVPA but not when controlling for body weight [77], and the aforementioned reduction in 
320 disinhibition and binge eating score following 12 weeks of exercise training which did not 
321 remain significant after controlling for change in body fat [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. 
322 These differences in disinhibition and binge eating were not apparent in non-obese individuals 
323 varying in PA levels [9, 10], suggesting the influence of habitual PA on eating behaviour traits 
324 may be more strongly influenced by body composition. In terms of food hedonics, differences 
325 in the rewarding value of foods (liking and wanting) have been observed in lean active 
326 compared to overweight inactive males [98], but in non-obese individuals, PA level did not 
327 influence liking and wanting for high-fat food in the hungry or fed states [9, 10]. In inactive 
328 individuals with overweight and obesity, 12 weeks of exercise training (125-250 kcal per 
329 exercise session) did not affect liking or wanting [99], whereas another 12-week intervention 
330 at a higher dose of exercise (500 kcal per exercise session) reduced the hedonic wanting for 
15
331 high-fat food independent of changes in body fat [Beaulieu et al. unpublished results]. 
332 Moreover, habitual (self-reported) PA may differently impact food cravings depending on 
333 exercise type and sex [100]. These studies suggest there may be differing effects of PA on
334 non-homeostatic appetite control according to an individual’s body fat status, sex, and dose 
335 and type of PA. 
336 Therefore, we can propose that in addition to individuals with non-regulated appetite 
337 having blunted satiety signalling, excess body fat in these individuals may amplify non 338 homeostatic inputs favouring overconsumption. In contrast, individuals with regulated appetite 
339 with higher levels of PA have enhanced postprandial sensitivity, allowing for EI to be better 
340 matched to EE in response to hunger and satiety signals. This is demonstrated in an updated 
341 perspective of the zones of appetite control in Figure 3.

350 6. Interaction between physical activity and diet composition on energy intake and 
351 energy balance 
352 While PA appears to affect several mechanisms of appetite control, as described 
353 above, whether it renders individuals less susceptible to overconsumption in the current 
354 obesogenic food environment has not been extensively examined. This is important to 
355 consider, with headlines stating “You cannot outrun a bad diet” [101]. Only a few studies have 
356 investigated the impact of PA and diet composition on EI and energy balance. A study by 
357 Tremblay et al. [102] in males found that consumption of a high-fat diet over two days following 
358 a 500-kcal exercise bout led to a positive energy balance, whereas consumption of a low-fat 
359 diet was able to maintain the energy deficit produced by exercise. Along those lines, 
360 Murgatroyd et al. [103] showed in males that increasing the dietary fat content (and energy 
361 density) of an ad libitum diet in a day where exercise was imposed (~675 kcal) increased EI 
362 and led to a positive energy balance (albeit not statistically significant). Moreover, consumption 
363 of a high-fat diet while imposing inactivity resulted in a daily positive energy balance of 
364 approximately 1000 kcal more than with imposed exercise, and 1200 kcal more than with 
365 exercise on a low-fat diet. Other studies in males [104] and females [105] corroborated these 
366 findings by demonstrating that the consumption of a high-fat meal following an exercise bout 
367 resulted in significantly greater relative EI (after considering the EE of the exercise) compared 
368 with a low-fat meal. Interestingly, palatability of both high-fat and low-fat meals increased after 
369 exercise compared to rest in females, but not in males [105]. These studies highlight the 
370 potency of the phenomenon of passive overconsumption. Therefore, the degree of 
371 compensation observed in response to PAEE can readily be modulated simply by altering the
372 energy density of the diet and proposals about compensation need to be interpreted with care. 
17
373 Whether being habitually physically active enhances the response to dietary 
374 manipulations is also of interest. As discussed above, we have shown that physically active 
375 individuals are also prone to acute passive overconsumption with an imposed high-fat meal 
376 [9]. In addition, while individuals with higher levels of PA were found to be sensitive to the 
377 acute nutritional manipulation of preloads varying in energy content by reducing EI at the 
378 following meal, objectively-measured daily EI (including the preload) was greater after a high 379 energy relative to a low-energy preload regardless of PA level, demonstrating an effect of 
380 passive overconsumption [10]. Others have shown that active individuals may compensate 
381 beyond the immediate meal following intake of a high-energy preload, attenuating the risk of 
382 overconsumption, but this was measured with food records and daily EI including the preload 
383 was not reported [90, 91, 93]. The long-term compensatory response to high energy density 
384 food consumption in physically active individuals is unknown. The EE associated with PA may 
385 be helpful in mitigating episodes of overconsumption and fluctuations in EI over time [106, 
386 107]. However, given the available evidence, in the general population, higher levels of 
387 habitual PA in conjunction with a diet lower in energy density appear to be optimal for appetite 
388 control and energy balance. 
389
390 7. Implications and future directions 
391 The impact of PA on the mechanisms of appetite control has implications for individuals 
392 wishing to lose fat mass through exercise as large variability in the individual response to 
393 exercise interventions have been observed [89, 108]. These varying responses in fat loss to 
394 exercise training suggest that some individuals compensate for the increase in PA (and EE) 
395 through greater food intake or other mechanisms impacting on energy balance, minimizing 
396 the effect of exercise on fat loss. In both those susceptible and resistant to exercise-induced 
397 weight loss, hunger and the strength of satiety were enhanced with exercise training, showing 
398 a robust effect of the dual-process action of PA on appetite control; however, the increase in 
18
399 hunger was greater in those resistant to weight loss [89]. The compensatory adaptations in 
400 appetite control and eating behaviour following exercise-induced weight loss are beyond the 
401 scope of this review and have been reviewed elsewhere [20, 109, 110]. Nevertheless, it should 
402 be acknowledged that certain baseline (pre-intervention) characteristics of appetite may 
403 predict the susceptibility to exercise-induced weight loss such as the hedonic response to 
404 acute exercise [111] and the peptide response to food consumption [112], which is of interest 
405 for future research to help personalise interventions to promote successful fat loss with 
406 exercise. 
407 The role of PAEE in driving EI is important for future research to clarify as it can make 
408 up a significant proportion of TDEE in physically active individuals (see Figure 1) [113]. While 
409 the influence of PA on some processes of appetite appear to be independent of body fat, more 
410 research is required to understand the role of body composition and body fat status in the 
411 relationship between PA level and appetite control. We have reported above that PA (or 
412 factors associated with PA) may moderate the relationship between fat mass and EI, which is 
413 an interesting avenue for future research. Other potential moderators of the relationship 
414 between PA and appetite that remain to be examined further include sex [114] and age [93]. 
415 Additionally, very little is known on how the type, dose, intensity and timing of habitual PA and 
416 exercise affect homeostatic and non-homeostatic appetite. The mechanisms responsible for 
417 the apparent enhancement in the satiety response to food consumption in physically active
418 individuals also remain to be fully elucidated. Finally, in light of the research on the interaction 
419 between PA and dietary manipulations, it is important for future research to take an energy 
420 balance perspective [115] to increase our understanding of the complex relationships and 
421 interactions among PA, diet composition, body composition and appetite control along the 
422 spectrum of PA levels. 
423
424 8. Summary 
19
425 Food intake is modulated by several homeostatic and non-homeostatic mechanisms 
426 controlling appetite. Evidence is accumulating to support the view that EI along the spectrum 
427 of PA is J-shaped, with individuals with low levels of PA being in a non-regulated zone of 
428 appetite whereas those with higher levels of PA operating in a regulated zone with more 
429 sensitive appetite control. Body fat also varies along the spectrum of PA and may impact the 
430 sensitivity of satiety signals and non-homeostatic inputs (food hedonics and behavioural traits) 
431 favouring overconsumption at lower levels of PA, but this remains to be fully understood. PA
432 affects the homeostatic mechanisms of appetite via a proposed dual-process action of
433 increased drive to eat from greater EE, but also by enhanced satiety response to food, likely 
434 through more sensitive postprandial signalling. An important tenet of our current position is 
435 that PAEE is a determinant of EI (although with greater variability than RMR). These 
436 processes generate a better adjustment of EI to EE in response to hunger and satiety signals 
437 at higher levels of PA. However, special attention needs to be given to diet composition, with 
438 a high-fat energy-dense diet leading to acute passive overconsumption of energy along the 
439 entire spectrum of PA. Importantly, the strength of the various mechanisms and determinants 
440 of appetite will vary between individuals along the spectrum of PA, highlighting the need to 
441 recognise that the impact of PA on appetite control is not a case of ‘one size fits all’.

14
304 influenced by PA level in non-obese individuals when measured with a passive 
305 overconsumption paradigm comparing ad libitum EI at meals high in fat or carbohydrate [9]. 
306 However, in overweight and obese individuals, Caudwell et al. [1] showed that exercise 
307 training led to a reduction in EI at a high-fat/energy dense test meal. This may be associated 
308 with enhanced satiation, but given the homeostatic and non-homeostatic determinants of food 
309 intake, may also reflect changes in food hedonics or behavioural traits. 
310 While there is strong support that habitual PA affects homeostatic mechanisms 
311 controlling food intake, less is known on its effect on non-homeostatic processes, and their 
312 contribution to appetite control along the spectrum of PA levels. Indeed, secondary analyses 
313 from the study from Caudwell et al. [1] revealed a reduction in hedonic wanting for high-fat 
314 foods relative to low-fat foods (Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire), disinhibition and binge 
315 eating following exercise training [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. Furthermore, another 
316 study from our group found inverse associations between time spent in MVPA and disinhibition 
317 and binge eating, but these did not remain significant after controlling for body fat [24]. This 
318 corroborates a study by Shook et al. who found greater disinhibition in their lowest quintile of 
319 MVPA but not when controlling for body weight [77], and the aforementioned reduction in 
320 disinhibition and binge eating score following 12 weeks of exercise training which did not 
321 remain significant after controlling for change in body fat [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. 
322 These differences in disinhibition and binge eating were not apparent in non-obese individuals 
323 varying in PA levels [9, 10], suggesting the influence of habitual PA on eating behaviour traits 
324 may be more strongly influenced by body composition. In terms of food hedonics, differences 
325 in the rewarding value of foods (liking and wanting) have been observed in lean active 
326 compared to overweight inactive males [98], but in non-obese individuals, PA level did not 
327 influence liking and wanting for high-fat food in the hungry or fed states [9, 10]. In inactive 
328 individuals with overweight and obesity, 12 weeks of exercise training (125-250 kcal per 
329 exercise session) did not affect liking or wanting [99], whereas another 12-week intervention 
330 at a higher dose of exercise (500 kcal per exercise session) reduced the hedonic wanting for 
15
331 high-fat food independent of changes in body fat [Beaulieu et al. unpublished results]. 
332 Moreover, habitual (self-reported) PA may differently impact food cravings depending on 
333 exercise type and sex [100]. These studies suggest there may be differing effects of PA on
334 non-homeostatic appetite control according to an individual’s body fat status, sex, and dose 
335 and type of PA. 
336 Therefore, we can propose that in addition to individuals with non-regulated appetite 
337 having blunted satiety signalling, excess body fat in these individuals may amplify non 338 homeostatic inputs favouring overconsumption. In contrast, individuals with regulated appetite 
339 with higher levels of PA have enhanced postprandial sensitivity, allowing for EI to be better 
340 matched to EE in response to hunger and satiety signals. This is demonstrated in an updated 
341 perspective of the zones of appetite control in Figure 3.

350 6. Interaction between physical activity and diet composition on energy intake and 
351 energy balance 
352 While PA appears to affect several mechanisms of appetite control, as described 
353 above, whether it renders individuals less susceptible to overconsumption in the current 
354 obesogenic food environment has not been extensively examined. This is important to 
355 consider, with headlines stating “You cannot outrun a bad diet” [101]. Only a few studies have 
356 investigated the impact of PA and diet composition on EI and energy balance. A study by 
357 Tremblay et al. [102] in males found that consumption of a high-fat diet over two days following 
358 a 500-kcal exercise bout led to a positive energy balance, whereas consumption of a low-fat 
359 diet was able to maintain the energy deficit produced by exercise. Along those lines, 
360 Murgatroyd et al. [103] showed in males that increasing the dietary fat content (and energy 
361 density) of an ad libitum diet in a day where exercise was imposed (~675 kcal) increased EI 
362 and led to a positive energy balance (albeit not statistically significant). Moreover, consumption 
363 of a high-fat diet while imposing inactivity resulted in a daily positive energy balance of 
364 approximately 1000 kcal more than with imposed exercise, and 1200 kcal more than with 
365 exercise on a low-fat diet. Other studies in males [104] and females [105] corroborated these 
366 findings by demonstrating that the consumption of a high-fat meal following an exercise bout 
367 resulted in significantly greater relative EI (after considering the EE of the exercise) compared 
368 with a low-fat meal. Interestingly, palatability of both high-fat and low-fat meals increased after 
369 exercise compared to rest in females, but not in males [105]. These studies highlight the 
370 potency of the phenomenon of passive overconsumption. Therefore, the degree of 
371 compensation observed in response to PAEE can readily be modulated simply by altering the
372 energy density of the diet and proposals about compensation need to be interpreted with care. 
17
373 Whether being habitually physically active enhances the response to dietary 
374 manipulations is also of interest. As discussed above, we have shown that physically active 
375 individuals are also prone to acute passive overconsumption with an imposed high-fat meal 
376 [9]. In addition, while individuals with higher levels of PA were found to be sensitive to the 
377 acute nutritional manipulation of preloads varying in energy content by reducing EI at the 
378 following meal, objectively-measured daily EI (including the preload) was greater after a high 379 energy relative to a low-energy preload regardless of PA level, demonstrating an effect of 
380 passive overconsumption [10]. Others have shown that active individuals may compensate 
381 beyond the immediate meal following intake of a high-energy preload, attenuating the risk of 
382 overconsumption, but this was measured with food records and daily EI including the preload 
383 was not reported [90, 91, 93]. The long-term compensatory response to high energy density 
384 food consumption in physically active individuals is unknown. The EE associated with PA may 
385 be helpful in mitigating episodes of overconsumption and fluctuations in EI over time [106, 
386 107]. However, given the available evidence, in the general population, higher levels of 
387 habitual PA in conjunction with a diet lower in energy density appear to be optimal for appetite 
388 control and energy balance. 
389
390 7. Implications and future directions 
391 The impact of PA on the mechanisms of appetite control has implications for individuals 
392 wishing to lose fat mass through exercise as large variability in the individual response to 
393 exercise interventions have been observed [89, 108]. These varying responses in fat loss to 
394 exercise training suggest that some individuals compensate for the increase in PA (and EE) 
395 through greater food intake or other mechanisms impacting on energy balance, minimizing 
396 the effect of exercise on fat loss. In both those susceptible and resistant to exercise-induced 
397 weight loss, hunger and the strength of satiety were enhanced with exercise training, showing 
398 a robust effect of the dual-process action of PA on appetite control; however, the increase in 
18
399 hunger was greater in those resistant to weight loss [89]. The compensatory adaptations in 
400 appetite control and eating behaviour following exercise-induced weight loss are beyond the 
401 scope of this review and have been reviewed elsewhere [20, 109, 110]. Nevertheless, it should 
402 be acknowledged that certain baseline (pre-intervention) characteristics of appetite may 
403 predict the susceptibility to exercise-induced weight loss such as the hedonic response to 
404 acute exercise [111] and the peptide response to food consumption [112], which is of interest 
405 for future research to help personalise interventions to promote successful fat loss with 
406 exercise. 
407 The role of PAEE in driving EI is important for future research to clarify as it can make 
408 up a significant proportion of TDEE in physically active individuals (see Figure 1) [113]. While 
409 the influence of PA on some processes of appetite appear to be independent of body fat, more 
410 research is required to understand the role of body composition and body fat status in the 
411 relationship between PA level and appetite control. We have reported above that PA (or 
412 factors associated with PA) may moderate the relationship between fat mass and EI, which is 
413 an interesting avenue for future research. Other potential moderators of the relationship 
414 between PA and appetite that remain to be examined further include sex [114] and age [93]. 
415 Additionally, very little is known on how the type, dose, intensity and timing of habitual PA and 
416 exercise affect homeostatic and non-homeostatic appetite. The mechanisms responsible for 
417 the apparent enhancement in the satiety response to food consumption in physically active
418 individuals also remain to be fully elucidated. Finally, in light of the research on the interaction 
419 between PA and dietary manipulations, it is important for future research to take an energy 
420 balance perspective [115] to increase our understanding of the complex relationships and 
421 interactions among PA, diet composition, body composition and appetite control along the 
422 spectrum of PA levels. 
423
424 8. Summary 
19
425 Food intake is modulated by several homeostatic and non-homeostatic mechanisms 
426 controlling appetite. Evidence is accumulating to support the view that EI along the spectrum 
427 of PA is J-shaped, with individuals with low levels of PA being in a non-regulated zone of 
428 appetite whereas those with higher levels of PA operating in a regulated zone with more 
429 sensitive appetite control. Body fat also varies along the spectrum of PA and may impact the 
430 sensitivity of satiety signals and non-homeostatic inputs (food hedonics and behavioural traits) 
431 favouring overconsumption at lower levels of PA, but this remains to be fully understood. PA
432 affects the homeostatic mechanisms of appetite via a proposed dual-process action of
433 increased drive to eat from greater EE, but also by enhanced satiety response to food, likely 
434 through more sensitive postprandial signalling. An important tenet of our current position is 
435 that PAEE is a determinant of EI (although with greater variability than RMR). These 
436 processes generate a better adjustment of EI to EE in response to hunger and satiety signals 
437 at higher levels of PA. However, special attention needs to be given to diet composition, with 
438 a high-fat energy-dense diet leading to acute passive overconsumption of energy along the 
439 entire spectrum of PA. Importantly, the strength of the various mechanisms and determinants 
440 of appetite will vary between individuals along the spectrum of PA, highlighting the need to 
441 recognise that the impact of PA on appetite control is not a case of ‘one size fits all’.

","Homeostatic and non-homeostatic appetite control along the spectrum of physical activity levels an updated perspective

284 5. The impact of physical activity and exercise on the mechanisms of appetite control 
285 Emerging studies are shedding light on the mechanisms contributing to the proposed 
286 dysregulation of appetite at lower levels of PA and more sensitive appetite control at higher 
287 levels of PA. These mechanisms may not necessarily be the same along the whole spectrum 
288 of PA levels. Acutely, exercise has been shown to influence gastric emptying [78], attenuate 
289 the release of ghrelin and increase the secretion of PYY, GLP-1 and pancreatic polypeptide 
290 [79]. Chronic exercise may increase the postprandial secretion of GLP-1 and PYY [80]. 
291 Therefore, habitual PA (and exercise) may interact with food intake to enhance hormonal 
292 satiety signalling [81]. Moreover, regular PA and exercise training are associated with several 
293 other physiological adaptations such as improved sensitivity to insulin [82] and leptin [83, 84], 
294 substrate metabolism [85], and body composition [86], which have been proposed as 
295 mechanisms involved in food intake and eating behaviour [87, 88]. Evidence suggests that PA 
296 influences appetite control through a dual-process action which increases the drive to eat but 
297 also post-meal satiety [89]. Several studies have now demonstrated that physically active 
298 individuals show better energy compensation than their less active counterparts following 
299 consumption of preloads differing in energy content such that they reduce EI to offset the 
300 difference in energy consumed from the preloads [10, 90-94]. This preload-test meal paradigm 
301 is effective in measuring the strength of satiety [95]. These improvements in satiety may be 
302 associated with exercise-induced adaptations in episodic satiety signalling [80, 91, 96] or
303 gastric emptying [97]. In contrast, we have shown that satiation does not appear to be 
14
304 influenced by PA level in non-obese individuals when measured with a passive 
305 overconsumption paradigm comparing ad libitum EI at meals high in fat or carbohydrate [9]. 
306 However, in overweight and obese individuals, Caudwell et al. [1] showed that exercise 
307 training led to a reduction in EI at a high-fat/energy dense test meal. This may be associated 
308 with enhanced satiation, but given the homeostatic and non-homeostatic determinants of food 
309 intake, may also reflect changes in food hedonics or behavioural traits. 
310 While there is strong support that habitual PA affects homeostatic mechanisms 
311 controlling food intake, less is known on its effect on non-homeostatic processes, and their 
312 contribution to appetite control along the spectrum of PA levels. Indeed, secondary analyses 
313 from the study from Caudwell et al. [1] revealed a reduction in hedonic wanting for high-fat 
314 foods relative to low-fat foods (Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire), disinhibition and binge 
315 eating following exercise training [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. Furthermore, another 
316 study from our group found inverse associations between time spent in MVPA and disinhibition 
317 and binge eating, but these did not remain significant after controlling for body fat [24]. This 
318 corroborates a study by Shook et al. who found greater disinhibition in their lowest quintile of 
319 MVPA but not when controlling for body weight [77], and the aforementioned reduction in 
320 disinhibition and binge eating score following 12 weeks of exercise training which did not 
321 remain significant after controlling for change in body fat [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. 
322 These differences in disinhibition and binge eating were not apparent in non-obese individuals 
323 varying in PA levels [9, 10], suggesting the influence of habitual PA on eating behaviour traits 
324 may be more strongly influenced by body composition. In terms of food hedonics, differences 
325 in the rewarding value of foods (liking and wanting) have been observed in lean active 
326 compared to overweight inactive males [98], but in non-obese individuals, PA level did not 
327 influence liking and wanting for high-fat food in the hungry or fed states [9, 10]. In inactive 
328 individuals with overweight and obesity, 12 weeks of exercise training (125-250 kcal per 
329 exercise session) did not affect liking or wanting [99], whereas another 12-week intervention 
330 at a higher dose of exercise (500 kcal per exercise session) reduced the hedonic wanting for 
15
331 high-fat food independent of changes in body fat [Beaulieu et al. unpublished results]. 
332 Moreover, habitual (self-reported) PA may differently impact food cravings depending on 
333 exercise type and sex [100]. These studies suggest there may be differing effects of PA on
334 non-homeostatic appetite control according to an individual’s body fat status, sex, and dose 
335 and type of PA. 
336 Therefore, we can propose that in addition to individuals with non-regulated appetite 
337 having blunted satiety signalling, excess body fat in these individuals may amplify non 338 homeostatic inputs favouring overconsumption. In contrast, individuals with regulated appetite 
339 with higher levels of PA have enhanced postprandial sensitivity, allowing for EI to be better 
340 matched to EE in response to hunger and satiety signals. This is demonstrated in an updated 
341 perspective of the zones of appetite control in Figure 3.

351 energy balance

363 of a high-fat diet while imposing inactivity resulted in a daily positive energy balance of 
364 approximately 1000 kcal more than with imposed exercise, and 1200 kcal more than with 
365 exercise on a low-fat diet. Other studies in males [104] and females [105] corroborated these 
366 findings by demonstrating that the consumption of a high-fat meal following an exercise bout
