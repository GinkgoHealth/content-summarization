text,"Impact of insufficient sleep on dysregulated blood glucose control under standardised meal conditions
DISCUSSION
Here, we describe for the first time how sleep duration, quality and midpoint associate with postprandial glucose metabolism in healthy individuals. While sleep is generally recognised as one of the pillars of good health, the data reported here suggest that one-size-fits-all sleep recommendations are suboptimal, particularly in the context of postprandial glycaemic control, a key component of diabetes prevention.

By analysing both between-person and within-person effects, this study provides unique and powerful insights into both population-level and person-level effects of sleep on metabolic health. Notably, our data suggest that sleep duration, efficiency and midpoint are important determinants of postprandial glycaemic control at a population level, while illustrating that to optimise sleep recommendations it is likely necessary to tailor these to the individual.

Diet, sleep and health are interrelated. Several studies have investigated the relationship between sleep duration and glucose metabolism in pregnant women and reported a positive association between reduced sleep duration and impaired glucose metabolism [4, 27]. However, we are not aware of any other studies to date that investigate the relationship between objectively assessed sleep characteristics and postprandial glucose metabolism in generally healthy adults. The findings from this intervention study, with repeated test meal challenges, combined with objective assessments of sleep and blood glucose from a large population, complement a relatively small body of knowledge around a topic that is likely to be of high relevance for diabetes prevention [26]. Importantly, many earlier studies were undertaken in sleep laboratories with small sample size [11]. While the controlled environment of such studies is necessary to understand specific aspects of sleep and metabolism, the real-world, community-dwelling setting of the current study provides novel insights into how habitual sleep affects metabolic health.

The main analyses in this study focused on interactions of sleep and meal type and selected the OGTT as the ‘breakfast’ against which all other breakfast meals were compared. This is primarily because the OGTT is the standard clinical test used to assess glucose tolerance. While this is not a realistic breakfast meal, there is a growing trend, particularly among younger people [28], to consume energy drinks as a pick-me-up the morning after a poor night’s sleep, with the sugar content of a 75 g OGTT equating to roughly two to three servings of standard energy drinks.

SPT
With SPT being a marker of sleep duration, the lack of a significant marginal effect in the model without interactions indicates that sleep duration is not a major determinant of glucose metabolism. While this finding does not support some prior studies that have demonstrated a potential link between decreased sleep duration and insulin resistance, it is consistent with findings from a randomised controlled trial of 42 normal-weight adult short sleepers [11]. This may be because the effect of sleep duration in glycaemic control may be non-linear, with sleep affecting glucose metabolism only once sleep duration dips below a specific bound [11]. Moreover, sleep duration for the vast majority of PREDICT1 participants fell within the recommended range, as indicated by the mean 6.87 h of sleep within the lowest quartile of the SPT distribution (Table 1). Accordingly, this study may have been underpowered to detect an association between sleep duration and postprandial glycaemic control.

We found a significant statistical interaction between SPT and meal type, with high-carbohydrate meals and high-fat meals resulting in significantly lower glucose iAUCs compared with the OGTT reference, which contained only sugar. Although this study did not include pregnant women, the interaction effect between carbohydrate-rich meals and SPT is consistent with the results reported in a prior study in which reduced sleep was associated with impaired carbohydrate metabolism in pregnant women [29]. Thus, we conclude that the SPT has a similar impact on postprandial carbohydrate metabolism in men and pregnant and non-pregnant women. Additionally, the significant interaction between SPT and high-fat meals is supported by the finding that sleep disruption in fat-fed mice negatively affected glucose metabolism, with metabolism improving after recovery sleep [30]. As for the within-person SPT model, our findings suggest that both a longer SPT in general, as well as having a longer SPT than one is used to, are associated with improved postprandial glycaemic control the following morning. The presence of a significant finding with the SPT × high-carbohydrate meal interaction term in the person-centred model suggests that getting more sleep than usual might be more important for postprandial glycaemic control than the absolute amount of sleep achieved. This insight offers a potential avenue for personalised (within-person) sleep interventions.

SE
Better SE, between-person as well as within-person, was significantly associated with lower glucose iAUC, meaning that better SE, which is a proxy of sleep quality, was associated with better glucose management following breakfast. However, the absence of SE × meal interactions suggests that SE may be beneficial for postprandial glucose response irrespective of meal composition. Although there is not much research on SE and glucose metabolism in healthy adults, our findings concur with a recent meta-analysis in which poor sleep quality was associated with poor glycaemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes [12]. Moreover, since SE can be viewed as a proxy for sleep quality, and because we found a significant association between SE and glucose regulation, but not between SPT and glucose regulation, our findings suggest that sleep quality is more important than sleep duration with respect to glycaemic control. However, sleep apnoea is known to affect SE, and sleep apnoea was not measured in the PREDICT1 study.

Sleep midpoint
The presence of significant effects in both between-person and within-person sleep midpoint models adjusted for sleep duration suggests a novel finding that later sleep midpoint, such as that caused by going to bed later, is associated with impaired postprandial glucose response to breakfast the following morning. This concurs with the proposition that human metabolic health is determined to a considerable extent by chronobiology [31]. Alternatively, later sleep midpoint may reflect alteration of sleep stages caused by going to bed later. Thus, the significance of later sleep midpoint may also be indicative of the role of specific sleep stages, such as slow-wave sleep, on glucose metabolism, supporting the view that treating slow-wave sleep disorders may help improve glycaemic control [32].

The 2 h glucose iAUC response to an OGTT breakfast is roughly twice that following a high-fat breakfast, indicating that a high-fat breakfast might help to mitigate the detrimental effects of poor sleep on postprandial glycaemia. Although comparing areas may have its drawbacks, for those whose sleep is often compromised, these effects may be cumulative. Thus, over time, there may be a meaningful clinical impact on glycaemic health. Nevertheless, because of the short duration of the current study, we are not able to assess this hypothesis.

Much of the research linking poor sleep with altered glucose metabolism is based upon observational studies, meaning that the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the associations reported here are not well understood [33]. However, poor sleep quality (measured by sleep fragmentation in healthy volunteers) appears to alter glucose responses through shifting sympathovagal balance and morning cortisol levels, which could in turn lead to decreased insulin sensitivity, increased hepatic glucogenesis and decreased insulin secretion [33]. In addition to cortisol levels, growth hormone, the secretion of which is sleep-dependent and which is essential for metabolic regulation, could also be at play [34,35,36]. Moreover, the glucose intolerance observed elsewhere in sleep-deprived individuals may derive from dysregulation of sympathetic and parasympathetic control of pancreatic function [37].

Strengths and limitations
This study significantly extends our understanding of the interplay between sleep and metabolic health. First, the fairly limited literature on sleep and postprandial blood glucose regulation is dominated by small studies that focus on populations with comorbid conditions (e.g. diabetes and obstructive sleep apnoea). In the few larger published studies, sleep has typically been assessed through self-report, which may be prone to bias. Moreover, most studies are cross-sectional and based in highly controlled environments. By contrast, our study is set within a large prospective cohort of generally healthy individuals, in whom high-resolution objectively assessed time-series sleep and glucose data were obtained. These design features made it possible to look at both intra- and inter-individual variation during the analyses, have generalisable results and shed light on cause and effect. The risk of non-compliance due to a non-clinical setting was addressed by high levels of staff support and all data points were checked for compliance and validity. We also examined the effects of within-person sleep measures, thus broadening the scope of previous studies that up to now only included between-person differences. In addition, instead of relying on fasting blood assays, the study focused on postprandial glucose, which is more relevant to everyday life scenarios because most people find themselves most often in a postprandial state during waking hours [26].

Notwithstanding the strengths of the study, it is limited in that no screening was performed for sleep disorders (e.g. sleep apnoea and insomnia), meaning that we could not control for disorders that have been shown to be associated with impaired glucose tolerance [38, 39]. In addition, while actigraphy overcomes many limitations of self-report measures, it is not as accurate as polysomnography in estimating sleep duration and efficiency and does not offer insight into individual sleep stages. The distribution of meal types was imbalanced, with high-fat and high-carbohydrate standardised meals having the highest number of entries. Thus, it is possible that analyses focused on the non-high-carbohydrate and non-high-fat meals may have lacked statistical power. An additional limitation is that owing to the free-living nature of the trial, physical activity levels varied within and between individuals, which may have interacted with sleep and meal type to affect blood glucose concentrations, a hypothesis that our study was not powered to examine.

Future studies assessing the impact of sleep stages on postprandial blood glucose levels are likely to extend the findings of the current analysis, as would exploration of these effects in individuals who are sleep-deprived owing to shift work or endogenous sleep disorders such as sleep apnoea.

Conclusion
Overall, this study suggests that sleep duration, quality and midpoint are important modifiable lifestyle features for improving postprandial glucose metabolism in healthy adults. As a consequence, this study’s findings may inform lifestyle strategies to improve postprandial blood glucose levels, focusing on earlier bedtime routines and maximising high-quality uninterrupted sleep. A combination of both generalised and more personalised sleep guidelines is likely required to ensure optimal metabolic health per se and maximise the effectiveness of guidelines for diabetes prevention.

Sleep midpoint
The presence of significant effects in both between-person and within-person sleep midpoint models adjusted for sleep duration suggests a novel finding that later sleep midpoint, such as that caused by going to bed later, is associated with impaired postprandial glucose response to breakfast the following morning. This concurs with the proposition that human metabolic health is determined to a considerable extent by chronobiology [31]. Alternatively, later sleep midpoint may reflect alteration of sleep stages caused by going to bed later. Thus, the significance of later sleep midpoint may also be indicative of the role of specific sleep stages, such as slow-wave sleep, on glucose metabolism, supporting the view that treating slow-wave sleep disorders may help improve glycaemic control [32].

The 2 h glucose iAUC response to an OGTT breakfast is roughly twice that following a high-fat breakfast, indicating that a high-fat breakfast might help to mitigate the detrimental effects of poor sleep on postprandial glycaemia. Although comparing areas may have its drawbacks, for those whose sleep is often compromised, these effects may be cumulative. Thus, over time, there may be a meaningful clinical impact on glycaemic health. Nevertheless, because of the short duration of the current study, we are not able to assess this hypothesis.

Much of the research linking poor sleep with altered glucose metabolism is based upon observational studies, meaning that the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the associations reported here are not well understood [33]. However, poor sleep quality (measured by sleep fragmentation in healthy volunteers) appears to alter glucose responses through shifting sympathovagal balance and morning cortisol levels, which could in turn lead to decreased insulin sensitivity, increased hepatic glucogenesis and decreased insulin secretion [33]. In addition to cortisol levels, growth hormone, the secretion of which is sleep-dependent and which is essential for metabolic regulation, could also be at play [34,35,36]. Moreover, the glucose intolerance observed elsewhere in sleep-deprived individuals may derive from dysregulation of sympathetic and parasympathetic control of pancreatic function [37].

Strengths and limitations
This study significantly extends our understanding of the interplay between sleep and metabolic health. First, the fairly limited literature on sleep and postprandial blood glucose regulation is dominated by small studies that focus on populations with comorbid conditions (e.g. diabetes and obstructive sleep apnoea). In the few larger published studies, sleep has typically been assessed through self-report, which may be prone to bias. Moreover, most studies are cross-sectional and based in highly controlled environments. By contrast, our study is set within a large prospective cohort of generally healthy individuals, in whom high-resolution objectively assessed time-series sleep and glucose data were obtained. These design features made it possible to look at both intra- and inter-individual variation during the analyses, have generalisable results and shed light on cause and effect. The risk of non-compliance due to a non-clinical setting was addressed by high levels of staff support and all data points were checked for compliance and validity. We also examined the effects of within-person sleep measures, thus broadening the scope of previous studies that up to now only included between-person differences. In addition, instead of relying on fasting blood assays, the study focused on postprandial glucose, which is more relevant to everyday life scenarios because most people find themselves most often in a postprandial state during waking hours [26].

Notwithstanding the strengths of the study, it is limited in that no screening was performed for sleep disorders (e.g. sleep apnoea and insomnia), meaning that we could not control for disorders that have been shown to be associated with impaired glucose tolerance [38, 39]. In addition, while actigraphy overcomes many limitations of self-report measures, it is not as accurate as polysomnography in estimating sleep duration and efficiency and does not offer insight into individual sleep stages. The distribution of meal types was imbalanced, with high-fat and high-carbohydrate standardised meals having the highest number of entries. Thus, it is possible that analyses focused on the non-high-carbohydrate and non-high-fat meals may have lacked statistical power. An additional limitation is that owing to the free-living nature of the trial, physical activity levels varied within and between individuals, which may have interacted with sleep and meal type to affect blood glucose concentrations, a hypothesis that our study was not powered to examine.

Future studies assessing the impact of sleep stages on postprandial blood glucose levels are likely to extend the findings of the current analysis, as would exploration of these effects in individuals who are sleep-deprived owing to shift work or endogenous sleep disorders such as sleep apnoea.

Conclusion
Overall, this study suggests that sleep duration, quality and midpoint are important modifiable lifestyle features for improving postprandial glucose metabolism in healthy adults. As a consequence, this study’s findings may inform lifestyle strategies to improve postprandial blood glucose levels, focusing on earlier bedtime routines and maximising high-quality uninterrupted sleep. A combination of both generalised and more personalised sleep guidelines is likely required to ensure optimal metabolic health per se and maximise the effectiveness of guidelines for diabetes prevention.
","Impact of insufficient sleep on dysregulated blood glucose control under standardised meal conditions
DISCUSSION
Here, we describe for the first time how sleep duration, quality and midpoint associate with postprandial glucose metabolism in healthy individuals. While sleep is generally recognised as one of the pillars of good health, the data reported here suggest that one-size-fits-all sleep recommendations are suboptimal, particularly in the context of postprandial glycaemic control, a key component of diabetes prevention.

By analysing both between-person and within-person effects, this study provides unique and powerful insights into both population-level and person-level effects of sleep on metabolic health. Notably, our data suggest that sleep duration, efficiency and midpoint are important determinants of postprandial glycaemic control at a population level, while illustrating that to optimise sleep recommendations it is likely necessary to tailor these to the individual.

Diet, sleep and health are interrelated. Several studies have investigated the relationship between sleep duration and glucose metabolism in pregnant women and reported a positive association between reduced sleep duration and impaired glucose metabolism [4, 27]. However, we are not aware of any other studies to date that investigate the relationship between objectively assessed sleep characteristics and postprandial glucose metabolism in generally healthy adults. The findings from this intervention study, with repeated test meal challenges, combined with objective assessments of sleep and blood glucose from a large population, complement a relatively small body of knowledge around a topic that is likely to be of high relevance for diabetes prevention [26]. Importantly, many earlier studies were undertaken in sleep laboratories with small sample size [11]. While the controlled environment of such studies is necessary to understand specific aspects of sleep and metabolism, the real-world, community-dwelling setting of the current study provides novel insights into how habitual sleep affects metabolic health.

The main analyses in this study focused on interactions of sleep and meal type and selected the OGTT as the ‘breakfast’ against which all other breakfast meals were compared. This is primarily because the OGTT is the standard clinical test used to assess glucose tolerance. While this is not a realistic breakfast meal, there is a growing trend, particularly among younger people [28], to consume energy drinks as a pick-me-up the morning after a poor night’s sleep, with the sugar content of a 75 g OGTT equating to roughly two to three servings of standard energy drinks.

SPT
With SPT being a marker of sleep duration, the lack of a significant marginal effect in the model without interactions indicates that sleep duration is not a major determinant of glucose metabolism. While this finding does not support some prior studies that have demonstrated a potential link between decreased sleep duration and insulin resistance, it is consistent with findings from a randomised controlled trial of 42 normal-weight adult short sleepers [11]. This may be because the effect of sleep duration in glycaemic control may be non-linear, with sleep affecting glucose metabolism only once sleep duration dips below a specific bound [11]. Moreover, sleep duration for the vast majority of PREDICT1 participants fell within the recommended range, as indicated by the mean 6.87 h of sleep within the lowest quartile of the SPT distribution (Table 1). Accordingly, this study may have been underpowered to detect an association between sleep duration and postprandial glycaemic control.

We found a significant statistical interaction between SPT and meal type, with high-carbohydrate meals and high-fat meals resulting in significantly lower glucose iAUCs compared with the OGTT reference, which contained only sugar. Although this study did not include pregnant women, the interaction effect between carbohydrate-rich meals and SPT is consistent with the results reported in a prior study in which reduced sleep was associated with impaired carbohydrate metabolism in pregnant women [29]. Thus, we conclude that the SPT has a similar impact on postprandial carbohydrate metabolism in men and pregnant and non-pregnant women. Additionally, the significant interaction between SPT and high-fat meals is supported by the finding that sleep disruption in fat-fed mice negatively affected glucose metabolism, with metabolism improving after recovery sleep [30]. As for the within-person SPT model, our findings suggest that both a longer SPT in general, as well as having a longer SPT than one is used to, are associated with improved postprandial glycaemic control the following morning. The presence of a significant finding with the SPT × high-carbohydrate meal interaction term in the person-centred model suggests that getting more sleep than usual might be more important for postprandial glycaemic control than the absolute amount of sleep achieved. This insight offers a potential avenue for personalised (within-person) sleep interventions.

SE
Better SE, between-person as well as within-person, was significantly associated with lower glucose iAUC, meaning that better SE, which is a proxy of sleep quality, was associated with better glucose management following breakfast. However, the absence of SE × meal interactions suggests that SE may be beneficial for postprandial glucose response irrespective of meal composition. Although there is not much research on SE and glucose metabolism in healthy adults, our findings concur with a recent meta-analysis in which poor sleep quality was associated with poor glycaemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes [12]. Moreover, since SE can be viewed as a proxy for sleep quality, and because we found a significant association between SE and glucose regulation, but not between SPT and glucose regulation, our findings suggest that sleep quality is more important than sleep duration with respect to glycaemic control. However, sleep apnoea is known to affect SE, and sleep apnoea was not measured in the PREDICT1 study.

The presence of significant effects in both between-person and within-person sleep midpoint models adjusted for sleep duration suggests a novel finding that later sleep midpoint, such as that caused by going to bed later, is associated with impaired postprandial glucose response to breakfast the following morning.

","Higher muscle fiber conduction velocity and early rate of torque development in chronically strength-trained individuals
DISCUSSION
MFCV was measured during explosive force contractions in a group of resistance-trained individuals and a control cohort. ST exhibited greater explosive torque, early RTD, and greater MFCV with respect to controls throughout the contraction. When explosive torque was normalized to maximal torque, ST had a higher RTD at the beginning of the contraction (0–50 ms). Moreover, a greater absolute and normalized conduction velocity (MFCVMAX) during the EMD and in the first 50 ms of torque generation was observed for the ST group. This result indicates a recruitment of motor units with greater conduction velocities. This is the first study showing that ST may recruit larger motor units in a shorter amount of time.

Muscle Fiber Conduction Velocity
The average MFCV values are in agreement with previous reports of MFCV during steady-state contractions. For example, Farina et al. reported estimates of MFCV in the BB during isometric steady-state contractions at 50% MVC of ~4.6 m/s (30). Zwarts and Arendt-Nielsen estimated MFCV at high contraction forces of the BB and reported values ranging between 3.22 and 5.11 m/s (57). MFCV average values in the present study were also in agreement with estimates of single-motor unit conduction velocities using intramuscular EMG recordings during voluntary and electrical activation of the BB muscle. Moreover, the present estimates are also in accordance with other studies involving different muscular contractions and protocols (25, 26, 32, 41, 42, 47, 48).

Interestingly, only two studies assessed MFCV in power athletes and only during electrical stimulation and maximal voluntary contractions (43, 49). Sadoyama et al. reported a significantly higher maximal MFCV in a group of trained sprinters compared with endurance runners (4.84 vs. 4.31 m/s; 49). Moreover, they reported a significant relation between the relative area of fast-twitch fibers and conduction velocity (49).

Recently, Methenitis et al. estimated MFCV during electrical stimulation of muscle fibers in endurance runners and power-trained and ST individuals and separately measured RTD (43). They reported significant relations between MFCV, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and rate of force development (43). However, estimates of MFCV were assessed during electrical stimulation and thus separately from the voluntary generation of explosive force. Therefore, it was not possible to associate the underlying neural strategies of muscle control with explosive force performance. Collectively, these previous results indicate that MFCV may be an indicator of muscle explosive performance, although no previous study assessed MFCV during explosive torque generation.

Explosive Torque and RTD
The RTD was significantly greater for ST during the early phase of explosive torque generation (Fig. 3A). However, when the moment-time curve was normalized to the maximal strength, the RTD for the resistance-trained subjects was significantly different only in the first 50 ms of the contraction (Fig. 3B). Because the relative explosive torque at 150 and 200 ms from contraction onset was similar between the two groups, the controls developed higher RTD during the second and third time windows from force onset (Fig. 3B).

Previous studies found an increase in the EMG amplitude and rate of force development in the initial phase of contraction after 4 wk of explosive training (7). In addition, a greater normalized rate of force development in the first 50 ms of contraction was found for power athletes during knee extensor explosive torque (51). Because the first 50 ms of contraction strongly reflect neural activation (13, 15, 16, 54), strength or power training presumably increases RTD by a faster recruitment of motor units, as discussed below.

MFCV During the Explosive Phase of Contraction
ST individuals have the ability to develop higher levels of force in the first 50 ms of contraction. This seems to be associated with greater MFCV in the same time interval, which indicates recruitment of motor units with greater conduction velocity. The role of motor unit recruitment during explosive force contraction is not well understood because it is not possible to identify representative populations of motor units in very short time intervals.

The primary determinant of motor unit twitch force is the number of muscle fibers innervated by the axon (17, 53). Motor unit peak twitch forces in humans range from ~6 to ~78 mN·m with maximal tetanic forces ranging from ~30 to ~200 mN·m (36, 38). Therefore, one of the mechanisms that determined the increase in RTD during the first 0–50-ms interval in the ST may have been the recruitment of larger motor units with greater and faster twitches. There is evidence showing correlations between electrically evoked twitch torque and early voluntary rate of force development, which could be associated with the differences in muscle fiber composition and/or Ca2+ saturation for the trained individuals (3, 34).

Interestingly, the two groups showed similar EMD values, which is in accordance with a previous study that compared the EMD in power-trained and untrained cohorts (51). This finding is, however, contradictory with a higher MFCV during the EMD. A higher absolute MFCV value should theoretically anticipate the release of Ca2+ and thus the rise in force. However, these problems may be related to the techniques employed in assessing the delay between the neural and muscular apparatus. The EMD during explosive contractions may not be sensitive to differences in neural activation due to a compressed recruitment (12, 15). We have recently shown that when the EMD is assessed as the time difference between the neural drive and force during the sustained contractions, the central nervous system modulates the delay broadly and according to the rate of force development (12). Indeed, the neuromechanical delay seems to be predominantly influenced by the type of recruited motor units and the intrinsic properties of the motor neuron (5, 12). Future studies assessing the neuromechanical delay in strength/power-trained individuals may be warranted.

MFCV increases with voluntary force production due to the relation between motor unit recruitment thresholds and fiber diameter (4, 8, 11, 35). This association implies that the ordered recruitment of motor units may be assessed by estimates of conduction velocity (10). We have recently reported that large, high-threshold motor units innervate fibers with large diameter (11), which explains the association between motor unit mechanical properties and conduction velocity previously reported (4). Moreover, we have recently demonstrated that the increase in average MFCV during voluntary force contractions is associated with the progressive recruitment of motor units with increasing conduction velocity and predicts recruitment thresholds at the individual subject level (10).

In the present study, MFCV was the average of the conduction velocities of the active motor units during explosive force contractions, in time intervals of 50 ms following EMG onset. We showed that there may be significant differences in the recruited motor units during explosive tasks in ST compared with moderately active individuals. Absolute MFCV values were greater in ST throughout the full duration of the explosive contractions (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the early absolute and normalized MFCV were positively associated with RTD (Fig. 4). Because absolute MFCV values are linearly related to the diameters of muscle fibers, higher absolute conduction velocity values may indicate that ST have muscle fibers with larger diameters due to the strength training-induced hypertrophy (43) compared with controls (24, 43).

However, when MFCV values were normalized to the maximal value during MVF (full motor unit recruitment), ST had a significantly greater MFCV-rel during the initial phase of the explosive contractions. Specifically, MFCV-relEMD and MFCV-rel0–50 were on average ~9% greater (Fig. 4B). This suggests that during the early phase of explosive force, ST have the ability to recruit motor units with faster conduction velocities in a shorter time. It takes ~100 ms more for the controls to reach similar values of normalized MFCV compared with the ST group. Interestingly, the changes in conduction velocity did not differ between groups (Fig. 4, A and B), and the MFCV plateaued in the interval 50–100 ms, which can be interpreted as full motor unit recruitment (10). This interpretation is in agreement with previous studies reporting that most motor units are recruited at one-third of maximal force during explosive contractions (15, 16). Moreover, MFCV increased in all subjects from the EMD to 0–50 ms, indicating that the ordered recruitment according to the size of the motor unit was preserved during the explosive tasks in both groups.

The underlying mechanism that may determine an increase in explosive force for the ST individuals may be an anticipated recruitment of high-threshold motor units with high conduction velocities. The difference between MFCV of high- and low-threshold motor units within a muscle is ~2 m/s (11). A faster motor unit recruitment (and conduction velocity) would achieve greater peak mechanical torques in a shorter time. The release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is correlated to the speed of the action potential on the fiber membrane (21). Indeed, MFCV is related to motor unit time-to-peak twitch forces (4). The increase in MFCV may potentially allow a faster calcium uptake and thus anticipating the rise in force.

Van Cutsem et al. reported an increase in motor unit discharge rates following ballistic training (55) and concluded, in agreement with other studies, that RTD depends on motor unit discharge rate (16, 18, 55). On the other hand, the recruitment threshold of motor units significantly influences the discharge rate at a given absolute force (18). Anticipating the recruitment of high-threshold motor units would result in reaching motor unit peak discharge rate and motor unit peak RTD in a shorter time. Accordingly, in the present study, MFCV was positively associated with RTD (Fig. 4A), suggesting that motor unit recruitment may play an important role in explosive force production.

Interestingly, the correlation between RTD0–50 and early MFCV values (MFCVEMD,0–50) was different for the ST and untrained individuals. MFCV0–50 was not correlated with RTD0–50 in the ST group (Fig. 4). This result indicates that ST completed the motor unit recruitment during the very early phase of explosive force, i.e., between the EMD and the first 50 ms from contraction onset (Fig. 4B). The increase in MFCV during the explosive force at the 50- and 100-ms time points for the ST is presumably due to some subjects continuing the recruitment while the subjects with higher RTD achieved a faster plateau in MFCV (Fig. 4). Indeed, it took more time for the untrained individuals to reach high MFCV (and full motor unit recruitment) values (Figs. 3 and 4).

It must be noted that the number of subjects in the present study may be too low for a correlation study. Moreover, the cross-sectional design cannot isolate the innate and environmental factors that contributed to the explosive force and MFCV differences found between the cohorts. However, in the present study the trained individuals performed combined strength and explosive training for >3 yr. Recent evidence showed a significant increase in explosive force production after 12 wk of isometric explosive training compared with isometric sustained-contraction strength training (6). The large differences in the early RTD for the trained subjects in the present study may also indicate that the neural contributors to explosive strength could be related to chronic exposure to explosive/strength training and that the neural adaptations may continue over time. Future studies assessing the neural contributors to explosive force in large cohorts and longitudinal (>1 yr) interventions are warranted.

Conclusion
Resistance-trained individuals showed higher RTD and explosive force in the very early phase of contraction that was accompanied by an increase in absolute and normalized MFCV compared with controls. These observations may be explained by recruitment of fast-twitch motor units (i.e., large motor units with large muscle fiber diameters) in a shorter amount of time in the resistance-trained cohort than in controls. In addition to the functional implications in the study of human explosive force, the study also presents a methodology that may be applied in the assessment of the neural strategies of muscle control in health, training, and pathology.
",,"Higher muscle fiber conduction velocity and early rate of torque development in chronically strength-trained individuals
DISCUSSION
MFCV was measured during explosive force contractions in a group of resistance-trained individuals and a control cohort. ST exhibited greater explosive torque, early RTD, and greater MFCV with respect to controls throughout the contraction. When explosive torque was normalized to maximal torque, ST had a higher RTD at the beginning of the contraction (0–50 ms). Moreover, a greater absolute and normalized conduction velocity (MFCVMAX) during the EMD and in the first 50 ms of torque generation was observed for the ST group. This result indicates a recruitment of motor units with greater conduction velocities. This is the first study showing that ST may recruit larger motor units in a shorter amount of time.

Muscle Fiber Conduction Velocity
The average MFCV values are in agreement with previous reports of MFCV during steady-state contractions. For example, Farina et al. reported estimates of MFCV in the BB during isometric steady-state contractions at 50% MVC of ~4.6 m/s (30). Zwarts and Arendt-Nielsen estimated MFCV at high contraction forces of the BB and reported values ranging between 3.22 and 5.11 m/s (57). MFCV average values in the present study were also in agreement with estimates of single-motor unit conduction velocities using intramuscular EMG recordings during voluntary and electrical activation of the BB muscle. Moreover, the present estimates are also in accordance with other studies involving different muscular contractions and protocols (25, 26, 32, 41, 42, 47, 48).

Interestingly, only two studies assessed MFCV in power athletes and only during electrical stimulation and maximal voluntary contractions (43, 49). Sadoyama et al. reported a significantly higher maximal MFCV in a group of trained sprinters compared with endurance runners (4.84 vs. 4.31 m/s; 49). Moreover, they reported a significant relation between the relative area of fast-twitch fibers and conduction velocity (49).

Recently, Methenitis et al. estimated MFCV during electrical stimulation of muscle fibers in endurance runners and power-trained and ST individuals and separately measured RTD (43). They reported significant relations between MFCV, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and rate of force development (43). However, estimates of MFCV were assessed during electrical stimulation and thus separately from the voluntary generation of explosive force. Therefore, it was not possible to associate the underlying neural strategies of muscle control with explosive force performance. Collectively, these previous results indicate that MFCV may be an indicator of muscle explosive performance, although no previous study assessed MFCV during explosive torque generation.

Explosive Torque and RTD
The RTD was significantly greater for ST during the early phase of explosive torque generation (Fig. 3A). However, when the moment-time curve was normalized to the maximal strength, the RTD for the resistance-trained subjects was significantly different only in the first 50 ms of the contraction (Fig. 3B). Because the relative explosive torque at 150 and 200 ms from contraction onset was similar between the two groups, the controls developed higher RTD during the second and third time windows from force onset (Fig. 3B).

Previous studies found an increase in the EMG amplitude and rate of force development in the initial phase of contraction after 4 wk of explosive training (7). In addition, a greater normalized rate of force development in the first 50 ms of contraction was found for power athletes during knee extensor explosive torque (51). Because the first 50 ms of contraction strongly reflect neural activation (13, 15, 16, 54), strength or power training presumably increases RTD by a faster recruitment of motor units, as discussed below.

MFCV During the Explosive Phase of Contraction
ST individuals have the ability to develop higher levels of force in the first 50 ms of contraction. This seems to be associated with greater MFCV in the same time interval, which indicates recruitment of motor units with greater conduction velocity. The role of motor unit recruitment during explosive force contraction is not well understood because it is not possible to identify representative populations of motor units in very short time intervals.

The primary determinant of motor unit twitch force is the number of muscle fibers innervated by the axon (17, 53). Motor unit peak twitch forces in humans range from ~6 to ~78 mN·m with maximal tetanic forces ranging from ~30 to ~200 mN·m (36, 38). Therefore, one of the mechanisms that determined the increase in RTD during the first 0–50-ms interval in the ST may have been the recruitment of larger motor units with greater and faster twitches. There is evidence showing correlations between electrically evoked twitch torque and early voluntary rate of force development, which could be associated with the differences in muscle fiber composition and/or Ca2+ saturation for the trained individuals (3, 34).

Interestingly, the two groups showed similar EMD values, which is in accordance with a previous study that compared the EMD in power-trained and untrained cohorts (51). This finding is, however, contradictory with a higher MFCV during the EMD. A higher absolute MFCV value should theoretically anticipate the release of Ca2+ and thus the rise in force. However, these problems may be related to the techniques employed in assessing the delay between the neural and muscular apparatus. The EMD during explosive contractions may not be sensitive to differences in neural activation due to a compressed recruitment (12, 15). We have recently shown that when the EMD is assessed as the time difference between the neural drive and force during the sustained contractions, the central nervous system modulates the delay broadly and according to the rate of force development (12). Indeed, the neuromechanical delay seems to be predominantly influenced by the type of recruited motor units and the intrinsic properties of the motor neuron (5, 12). Future studies assessing the neuromechanical delay in strength/power-trained individuals may be warranted.

MFCV increases with voluntary force production due to the relation between motor unit recruitment thresholds and fiber diameter (4, 8, 11, 35). This association implies that the ordered recruitment of motor units may be assessed by estimates of conduction velocity (10). We have recently reported that large, high-threshold motor units innervate fibers with large diameter (11), which explains the association between motor unit mechanical properties and conduction velocity previously reported (4). Moreover, we have recently demonstrated that the increase in average MFCV during voluntary force contractions is associated with the progressive recruitment of motor units with increasing conduction velocity and predicts recruitment thresholds at the individual subject level (10).

In the present study, MFCV was the average of the conduction velocities of the active motor units during explosive force contractions, in time intervals of 50 ms following EMG onset. We showed that there may be significant differences in the recruited motor units during explosive tasks in ST compared with moderately active individuals. Absolute MFCV values were greater in ST throughout the full duration of the explosive contractions (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the early absolute and normalized MFCV were positively associated with RTD (Fig. 4). Because absolute MFCV values are linearly related to the diameters of muscle fibers, higher absolute conduction velocity values may indicate that ST have muscle fibers with larger diameters due to the strength training-induced hypertrophy (43) compared with controls (24, 43).

However, when MFCV values were normalized to the maximal value during MVF (full motor unit recruitment), ST had a significantly greater MFCV-rel during the initial phase of the explosive contractions. Specifically, MFCV-relEMD and MFCV-rel0–50 were on average ~9% greater (Fig. 4B). This suggests that during the early phase of explosive force, ST have the ability to recruit motor units with faster conduction velocities in a shorter time. It takes ~100 ms more for the controls to reach similar values of normalized MFCV compared with the ST group. Interestingly, the changes in conduction velocity did not differ between groups (Fig. 4, A and B), and the MFCV plateaued in the interval 50–100 ms, which can be interpreted as full motor unit recruitment (10). This interpretation is in agreement with previous studies reporting that most motor units are recruited at one-third of maximal force during explosive contractions (15, 16). Moreover, MFCV increased in all subjects from the EMD to 0–50 ms, indicating that the ordered recruitment according to the size of the motor unit was preserved during the explosive tasks in both groups.

The underlying mechanism that may determine an increase in explosive force for the ST individuals may be an anticipated recruitment of high-threshold motor units with high conduction velocities. The difference between MFCV of high- and low-threshold motor units within a muscle is ~2 m/s (11). A faster motor unit recruitment (and conduction velocity) would achieve greater peak mechanical torques in a shorter time. The release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is correlated to the speed of the action potential on the fiber membrane (21). Indeed, MFCV is related to motor unit time-to-peak twitch forces (4). The increase in MFCV may potentially allow a faster calcium uptake and thus anticipating the rise in force.

Van Cutsem et al. reported an increase in motor unit discharge rates following ballistic training (55) and concluded, in agreement with other studies, that RTD depends on motor unit discharge rate (16, 18, 55). On the other hand, the recruitment threshold of motor units significantly influences the discharge rate at a given absolute force (18). Anticipating the recruitment of high-threshold motor units would result in reaching motor unit peak discharge rate and motor unit peak RTD in a shorter time. Accordingly, in the present study, MFCV was positively associated with RTD (Fig. 4A), suggesting that motor unit recruitment may play an important role in explosive force production.

Interestingly, the correlation between RTD0–50 and early MFCV values (MFCVEMD,0–50) was different for the ST and untrained individuals. MFCV0–50 was not correlated with RTD0–50 in the ST group (Fig. 4). This result indicates that ST completed the motor unit recruitment during the very early phase of explosive force, i.e., between the EMD and the first 50 ms from contraction onset (Fig. 4B). The increase in MFCV during the explosive force at the 50- and 100-ms time points for the ST is presumably due to some subjects continuing the recruitment while the subjects with higher RTD achieved a faster plateau in MFCV (Fig. 4). Indeed, it took more time for the untrained individuals to reach high MFCV (and full motor unit recruitment) values (Figs. 3 and 4).
