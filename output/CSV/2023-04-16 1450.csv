Maximal over-the-counter doses of NSAIDs compromise resistance exercise-induced increases in muscle size and strength in young adults. Ibuprofen was found to have a marked effect on muscle hypertrophy and a reduction in IL-6 gene expression. The study highlights the importance of drug dosage in resistance training studies and raises concerns about the use of NSAIDs during exercise. #NSAIDs #resistancetraining #musclestrength #musclehypertrophy #exerciseadaptations,"Hey, did you know that high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen can compromise muscle strength and hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young adults? A study showed that the maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen compromised muscle hypertrophy independent of training mode, and increased muscle strength was attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The study found that the negative effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake, and there may be distinct differences in the response to resistance training and NSAID consumption in the young vs. the elderly. This study provides strong proof-of-principle evidence that the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake."
"High doses of anti-inflammatory drugs, specifically ibuprofen, can compromise muscle strength and hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young adults. This was shown in a study where healthy young men and women performed 8 weeks of supervised resistance training with concomitant high- or low-dose NSAID treatment. The study found that maximal doses of ibuprofen compromised resistance exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy independent of training mode, and increases in muscle strength were attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. This study highlights the importance of drug dosage when taking NSAIDs and their effect on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise.","Hey, did you know that high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen can compromise muscle strength and hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young adults? In a recent study, healthy young men and women performed 8 weeks of supervised resistance training with concomitant high- or low-dose NSAID treatment. The major findings were that maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen compromised resistance exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy independent of training mode and increases in muscle strength were attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The increase in muscle volume in the ASA group was of a similar magnitude to that previously reported by other studies, while the reduction in muscle hypertrophy in response to the ibuprofen treatment was quite remarkable. The study shows that daily consumption of high doses of NSAIDs attenuates strength and muscle hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young healthy individuals, and the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake."
"High doses of anti-inflammatory drugs, specifically ibuprofen, compromise muscle strength and hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young adults, according to a recent study. The study found that maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen compromised resistance exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy independent of training mode, and increases in muscle strength were attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The study provides strong proof-of-principle evidence that the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake, and has important implications for individuals who consume NSAIDs on a regular basis while trying to obtain the best possible benefits of resistance training.","Hey! Did you know that a new study found that high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen, can compromise muscle strength and hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young adults? The study showed that daily consumption of maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen can actually reduce muscle hypertrophy and strength gains during resistance training. Interestingly, the study also found that muscle size and strength gains were attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The only marked difference across medical treatment was a significant ibuprofen-induced reduction in IL-6 gene expression, which in our mind reflected a changed inflammatory environment that, speculatively, contributed to the attenuated hypertrophic development in the ibuprofen group. These findings have important implications for the millions of individuals worldwide who consume NSAIDs on a regular basis while trying to obtain the best possible benefits of resistance training."

The study showed that maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen can reduce muscle hypertrophy by 7.5% and attenuate increases in muscle strength, especially when training is performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The study also found that the negative effect of ibuprofen on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake, and that the drug can interfere with the normal hypertrophic development of 0.1Â–0.2% per day seen in other studies employing conventional resistance-training programmes for the knee extensors. The study provides strong proof-of-principle evidence that the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake, and the mechanistic findings should contribute to a better understanding of regulation of muscle growth in general."
