DISCUSSION 
This is the first study to investigate the effects of different attentional focus strategies on long-term muscular adaptations. The study produced several novel and notable findings. First, an internal focus elicited superior hypertrophic increases in the elbow flexors compared to an external focus, but MT in the quadriceps was unaffected by attentional focus strategy. The differences in changes in elbow flexor size between INTERNAL and EXTERNAL (12.4% vs. 6.9%, respectively) translated into a large magnitude of effect favouring the INTERNAL condition (h2 p = 0.307). These findings partially support the common bodybuilding claim that a mindmuscle connection enhances muscle growth. Although we did not attempt to determine mechanistic reasons for discrepant findings between the upper and lower limbs, it can be speculated that subjects found it easier to focus on the elbow flexor muscles compared to the thighs  a sentiment that was anecdotally expressed by several participants in the INTERNAL group. Postulations regarding the mechanisms of this phenomenon can be deduced from motor control and neuroplasticity perspectives. First, neuromuscular reeducation, at least following tendon transfer, appears to be more prevalent in upper compared to lower extremities (Sperry, 1945), suggesting that the nervous system is better able to alter muscle recruitment patterns of the upper extremity. Second, individuals have greater force control of their elbow flexors than their knee extensors (Tracy, Mehoudar, & Ortega, 2007). Indeed, this may relate to why individuals have better control of and coordination with their upper extremities when compared to their lower extremities (Kauranen & Vanharanta, 1996). Practically speaking, Gordon and Ferris (Gordon & Ferris, 2004) speculated, If there are inherent differences in efferent control between any muscle groups, it would seem likely that lower limb muscles might be the least accurate. Humans rarely perform fine motor tasks with their lower limbs, instead relying on them for gross power output during locomotion. Such sentiments do not preclude one from being able to learn how to effectively utilize an internal focus of attention. That is, such a phenomenon may be related to the subjects untrained statuses, as individuals with RT experience have been shown to be able to increase quadriceps EMG amplitude when directed to focus on the thigh musculature during knee extension exercise (Marchant & Greig, 2017), and recent evidence suggests that training statusdependent control may indeed be muscle-specific (Calatayud et al., 2016). If true, this would suggest that trained individuals may be able to enhance quadriceps hypertrophy by adopting an internal focus during lower body RT. Perhaps differences in this regard would have been borne out with a longer intervention period. Further investigation is needed to test the validity of this hypothesis.

Attentional focus had markedly different effects specific to the upper versus lower limbs. With respect to peak isometric elbow flexion strength, INTERNAL resulted in a 16.2% increase versus a 2.6% in EXTERNAL, translating into an ES of a moderate magnitude of effect (h2 p = 0.114). These potential findings are in contrast to acute studies, wherein an external focus of attention is often found to result in greater strength performance than an internal focus of attention (Marchant et al., 2009); therefore, it is important to note that participants were not encouraged to utilize specific attentional foci during strength testing. Although potential mechanisms for these non-statistical differences in isometric elbow flexion strength were not studied, two often-proposed mechanisms of strength gain include peripheral (i.e. muscle hypertrophy and normalized muscle force) and neural (i.e. neural drive and excitation) changes (Erskine, Jones, Williams, Stewart, & Degens, 2010). To explore muscle size as a potential contributor, an additional ANCOVA was carried out post hoc, using the change in elbow flexor thickness as a covariate. After accounting for the change in elbow flexor thickness, the magnitude of the group effect decreased substantially, from moderate (h2 p = 0.114) to trivial (h2 p = 0.006). In contrast to recent criticisms of the theory that hypertrophy is related to changes in strength (Buckner et al., 2016), it appears that, in this study, differences in hypertrophy accounted for potential differences in strength between groups. As opposed to isometric elbow flexion strength, peak isometric knee extension strength favoured EXTERNAL versus INTERNAL (20.4% vs. 10.1%, respectively), with the ES indicating a small magnitude of effect (h2 p = 0.064). Although the observed effect size was small and did not reach the a priori alpha, in the interest of consistency, another post hoc ANCOVA was carried out, utilizing both changes in vastus lateralis and rectus femoris thickness as covariates, but unlike elbow flexion strength, the change in magnitude of the effect size was minuscule (h2 p = 0.052). The study had several notable limitations. First, the exercise protocol employed a moderate repetition range and thus the results cannot necessarily be extrapolated to training with heavier or lighter loads, especially because the acute effects of internal cueing are load-dependent (Calatayud et al., 2016). Second, although we provided explicit instructions on the focus of attention and supplemented the instructions with cueing throughout each set, there is no way to be sure that subjects were actually focusing as directed. It remains possible that some subjects did not adhere to the proper focus in at least some of the sets, which in turn may have altered results. That said, the marked between-group differences in elbow flexor muscle growth favouring the internal focus condition provides strong evidence that cueing strategies affect hypertrophic outcomes. Third, MT was measured only at the mid-portion of the muscles. Although this region is widely considered to be indicative of overall muscle growth, some studies report that hypertrophy manifests in a regionalspecific manner, with greater adaptations seen proximally and/or distally (Wakahara et al., 2012; Wakahara, Fukutani, Kawakami, & Yanai, 2013). Thus, we cannot discount the prospect that greater proximal or distal increases in MT occurred in one protocol versus the other. Fourth, we were not able to obtain accurate reporting on dietary practices throughout the study and thus cannot rule out the possibility that differences in nutritional intake unduly confounded results. Finally, the findings are specific to untrained subjects; future research is needed to determine the strength- and hypertrophyrelated effects of different attentional focus strategies on those with previous RT experience. 

CONCLUSION 
Our findings indicate that an internal focus of attention is superior to an external focus of attention when the goal is to maximize hypertrophy of the elbow flexors. Attentional focus does not seem to affect lower extremity hypertrophy, which may be due to the difficulty for untrained individuals to establish a mind-muscle connection in the thigh musculature during resistive exercise.

That is, such a phenomenon may be related to the subjects untrained statuses, as individuals with RT experience have been shown to be able to increase quadriceps EMG amplitude when directed to focus on the thigh musculature during knee extension exercise (Marchant & Greig, 2017), and recent evidence suggests that training statusdependent control may indeed be muscle-specific (Calatayud et al., 2016). If true, this would suggest that trained individuals may be able to enhance quadriceps hypertrophy by adopting an internal focus during lower body RT. Perhaps differences in this regard would have been borne out with a longer intervention period. Further investigation is needed to test the validity of this hypothesis.

Attentional focus had markedly different effects specific to the upper versus lower limbs. With respect to peak isometric elbow flexion strength, INTERNAL resulted in a 16.2% increase versus a 2.6% in EXTERNAL, translating into an ES of a moderate magnitude of effect (h2 p = 0.114). These potential findings are in contrast to acute studies, wherein an external focus of attention is often found to result in greater strength performance than an internal focus of attention (Marchant et al., 2009); therefore, it is important to note that participants were not encouraged to utilize specific attentional foci during strength testing. Although potential mechanisms for these non-statistical differences in isometric elbow flexion strength were not studied, two often-proposed mechanisms of strength gain include peripheral (i.e. muscle hypertrophy and normalized muscle force) and neural (i.e. neural drive and excitation) changes (Erskine, Jones, Williams, Stewart, & Degens, 2010). To explore muscle size as a potential contributor, an additional ANCOVA was carried out post hoc, using the change in elbow flexor thickness as a covariate. After accounting for the change in elbow flexor thickness, the magnitude of the group effect decreased substantially, from moderate (h2 p = 0.114) to trivial (h2 p = 0.006). In contrast to recent criticisms of the theory that hypertrophy is related to changes in strength (Buckner et al., 2016), it appears that, in this study, differences in hypertrophy accounted for potential differences in strength between groups. As opposed to isometric elbow flexion strength, peak isometric knee extension strength favoured EXTERNAL versus INTERNAL (20.4% vs. 10.1%, respectively), with the ES indicating a small magnitude of effect (h2 p = 0.064). Although the observed effect size was small and did not reach the a priori alpha, in the interest of consistency, another post hoc ANCOVA was carried out, utilizing both changes in vastus lateralis and rectus femoris thickness as covariates, but unlike elbow flexion strength, the change in magnitude of the effect size was minuscule (h2 p = 0.052). The study had several notable limitations. First, the exercise protocol employed a moderate repetition range and thus the results cannot necessarily be extrapolated to training with heavier or lighter loads, especially because the acute effects of internal cueing are load-dependent (Calatayud et al., 2016). Second, although we provided explicit instructions on the focus of attention and supplemented the instructions with cueing throughout each set, there is no way to be sure that subjects were actually focusing as directed. It remains possible that some subjects did not adhere to the proper focus in at least some of the sets, which in turn may have altered results. That said, the marked between-group differences in elbow flexor muscle growth favouring the internal focus condition provides strong evidence that cueing strategies affect hypertrophic outcomes. Third, MT was measured only at the mid-portion of the muscles. Although this region is widely considered to be indicative of overall muscle growth, some studies report that hypertrophy manifests in a regionalspecific manner, with greater adaptations seen proximally and/or distally (Wakahara et al., 2012; Wakahara, Fukutani, Kawakami, & Yanai, 2013). Thus, we cannot discount the prospect that greater proximal or distal increases in MT occurred in one protocol versus the other. Fourth, we were not able to obtain accurate reporting on dietary practices throughout the study and thus cannot rule out the possibility that differences in nutritional intake unduly confounded results. Finally, the findings are specific to untrained subjects; future research is needed to determine the strength- and hypertrophyrelated effects of different attentional focus strategies on those with previous RT experience. 

CONCLUSION 
Our findings indicate that an internal focus of attention is superior to an external focus of attention when the goal is to maximize hypertrophy of the elbow flexors. Attentional focus does not seem to affect lower extremity hypertrophy, which may be due to the difficulty for untrained individuals to establish a mind-muscle connection in the thigh musculature during resistive exercise.

DISCUSSION 
This is the first study to investigate the effects of different attentional focus strategies on long-term muscular adaptations. The study produced several novel and notable findings. First, an internal focus elicited superior hypertrophic increases in the elbow flexors compared to an external focus, but MT in the quadriceps was unaffected by attentional focus strategy. The differences in changes in elbow flexor size between INTERNAL and EXTERNAL (12.4% vs. 6.9%, respectively) translated into a large magnitude of effect favouring the INTERNAL condition (h2 p = 0.307). These findings partially support the common bodybuilding claim that a mindmuscle connection enhances muscle growth. Although we did not attempt to determine mechanistic reasons for discrepant findings between the upper and lower limbs, it can be speculated that subjects found it easier to focus on the elbow flexor muscles compared to the thighs  a sentiment that was anecdotally expressed by several participants in the INTERNAL group. Postulations regarding the mechanisms of this phenomenon can be deduced from motor control and neuroplasticity perspectives. First, neuromuscular reeducation, at least following tendon transfer, appears to be more prevalent in upper compared to lower extremities (Sperry, 1945), suggesting that the nervous system is better able to alter muscle recruitment patterns of the upper extremity. Second, individuals have greater force control of their elbow flexors than their knee extensors (Tracy, Mehoudar, & Ortega, 2007). Indeed, this may relate to why individuals have better control of and coordination with their upper extremities when compared to their lower extremities (Kauranen & Vanharanta, 1996). Practically speaking, Gordon and Ferris (Gordon & Ferris, 2004) speculated, If there are inherent differences in efferent control between any muscle groups, it would seem likely that lower limb muscles might be the least accurate. Humans rarely perform fine motor tasks with their lower limbs, instead relying on them for gross power output during locomotion.

The findings highlight the potential barriers weight stigma creates for healthy behaviors and suggest the need for more weight-inclusive approaches to health promotion. #weightstigma #healthbehaviors #healthpromotion #research","Weight stigma and health behaviors: evidence from the Eating in America Study

DISCUSSION 

The present study employed a two-stage research investigation to examine the relationship between weight stigma and several health behaviors in a large sample of U.S. adults. As predicted, weight stigma was significantly associated with greater disordered eating, comfort eating, alcohol use, and sleep disturbance, after controlling for covariates. No such relationship was observed for physical activity. Targeting health behaviors (e.g., eating) to achieve weight loss is common in weight-focused health promotion policies. These policies assume that individuals can improve their health by losing weight, employing weight stigma as one strategy for motivating behavior change [5]. However, our findings indicate that weight stigma is associated with poorer health behaviors, independent of BMI. Given that physical health and weight are largely shaped by factors outside of an individuals control (i.e., genetics and social determinants like socioeconomic status) [5], it is concerning that multiple behaviors, for which individuals have some control over, may be undermined by weight stigma. Furthermore, a lower BMI may not necessarily be protective against weight stigma. In our sample, individuals across the weight spectrum, not only those with overweight or obese BMIs, reported weight stigma. In fact, moderation analyses indicated that individuals with lower BMIs showed greater disordered eating and alcohol use in the face of weight stigma. These results emerged despite individuals with higher weight reporting greater daily weight stigma. One explanation for the observed differences in health behavioral outcomes across the weight spectrum is that infrequent health behaviors may be less likely to be enacted as coping strategies. For instance, previous research has shown that alcohol use decreases as BMI increases among females with higher weight [44]. Thus, using food, instead of alcohol, may be the more common coping strategy among individuals with higher BMIs, as previous research suggests [45]. Nonetheless, the sizes of the moderation effects were very small, with some confidence intervals functionally at zero, and thus further interpretation of the present findings should only be done with caution. Prior research has found conflicting evidence for the relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. Some studies have found that greater weight stigma is associated with short-term increases in reported exercise behavior [16, 46]. Others have shown that weight stigma is positively correlated with increased exercise avoidance, but has no direct link to self-reported exercise [14, 47]. The current study adds to the latter base of evidence showing no relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. One possible explanation is that participants were asked about their daily experiences with weight stigma, which may not correspond to their level of physical activity over the past month. Ecological momentary assessment methodology may provide better insight into this relationship, as demonstrated by Vartanian et al. who examined health motivations following stigmatizing events in daily life [48]. Despite emerging evidence that weight stigma is prevalent among men [28], there is a lack of research on mens health outcomes related to weight stigma. In this study, moderation by gender was not observed for any outcome. These results are consistent with previous research reporting no gender differences in poor health outcomes such as mortality and obesity due to weight stigma [3, 49]. Men may also feel pressured to meet societal body standards and thus may display the same magnitude of associations between weight stigma and health behaviors. It is recommended that the null gender findings are interpreted with caution, as more research is needed. How might weight stigma influence an individuals health behaviors? One potential mechanism is stress. Previous work suggests that weight stigma is stressful [6, 50] and experimental lab studies manipulating weight stigma have shown that individuals with higher weight, as well as those who perceive themselves as overweight, show elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol following exposure to a weight-stigmatizing event [51, 52]. Additionally, some research has found that individuals who experience more weight-based discrimination have higher hair cortisol levelsa finding most pronounced in those at the highest BMI [53]. Individuals who experience greater stress may engage in more unhealthy coping behaviors. Indeed, stress can drive changes in behaviors such as eating, physical activity, and sleep [54]. For example, Tataranni et al. administered synthetic cortisol vs. placebo and found greater food consumption in the cortisol group [55]. This early work is supported by accumulating evidence that cortisol is associated with increased caloric intake and greater abdominal fat storage [56]. The health behavior pathway may not be independent from that of stress but rather reflect a serial mediation model, wherein weight stigma increases stress that in turn causes decrements in health behaviors. The present study contributes to the weight stigma literature in several ways. As noted, a key strength of this study is the assessment of several health behaviors within a large, national census-matched sample. Previous studies that have examined weight stigma in relation to different health behaviors have often had small sample sizes or were limited to female subjects. Thus, the present study may provide more generalizable information about health behaviors in the U.S. A related strength of the study is that higher BMI scores were well-represented in the sample, with 31.4% meeting BMI criteria for obesity. This is a closer estimate of the proportion of the American population that is classified with obesity (42%) compared to previous studies [57]. Therefore, there is greater confidence that these findings reflect the experiences of individuals with obesity in the population, aiding generalizability. Lastly, we enhance reproducibility by presenting a twostage research program of exploratory and confirmatory analyses based on recommended open science practices. There are some limitations to consider. First, a composite weight stigma score was used due to survey constraints. While early tests indicate good construct validity, additional psychometric testing is warranted (see Online Supplementary Materials 4). Another limitation is the use of selfreported weight, which is subject to inaccuracies. Additionally, the data collection period overlapped with winter holidays. Individuals may have made new years health resolutions, and therefore the self-reported health behaviors may be more indicative of newly established goals rather than typical health habits. However, such resolutions would likely dampen, rather than magnify, the relationship between weight stigma and poor health behaviors. Lastly, the study is cross-sectional and therefore causal direction cannot be determined. Weight stigma may operate as a feedback loop that leads to weight gain through certain behaviors such as comfort eating [6], but further investigation is required. Given survey constraints, weight bias internalization was not assessed. Future research should build on these findings to determine the potential role of weight bias internalization in these health behaviors. Despite these limitations, these studys findings show that weight stigma is significantly associated with several health behaviors. If future research confirms that this is indeed a causal relationship, weight stigma could cumulatively undermine physical health over time. Taken together, these findings highlight weight stigma as a potential barrier to healthy behaviors, and suggest that one strategy to improve population health may be to reduce weight stigma. Though more research is needed, it may be important to employ more weight-inclusive approaches to health promotion, such as removing stigmatizing language or weight outcomes from health policies and program objectives [5].

DISCUSSION 

The present study employed a two-stage research investigation to examine the relationship between weight stigma and several health behaviors in a large sample of U.S. adults. As predicted, weight stigma was significantly associated with greater disordered eating, comfort eating, alcohol use, and sleep disturbance, after controlling for covariates. No such relationship was observed for physical activity. Targeting health behaviors (e.g., eating) to achieve weight loss is common in weight-focused health promotion policies. These policies assume that individuals can improve their health by losing weight, employing weight stigma as one strategy for motivating behavior change [5]. However, our findings indicate that weight stigma is associated with poorer health behaviors, independent of BMI. Given that physical health and weight are largely shaped by factors outside of an individuals control (i.e., genetics and social determinants like socioeconomic status) [5], it is concerning that multiple behaviors, for which individuals have some control over, may be undermined by weight stigma. Furthermore, a lower BMI may not necessarily be protective against weight stigma. In our sample, individuals across the weight spectrum, not only those with overweight or obese BMIs, reported weight stigma. In fact, moderation analyses indicated that individuals with lower BMIs showed greater disordered eating and alcohol use in the face of weight stigma. These results emerged despite individuals with higher weight reporting greater daily weight stigma. One explanation for the observed differences in health behavioral outcomes across the weight spectrum is that infrequent health behaviors may be less likely to be enacted as coping strategies. For instance, previous research has shown that alcohol use decreases as BMI increases among females with higher weight [44]. Thus, using food, instead of alcohol, may be the more common coping strategy among individuals with higher BMIs, as previous research suggests [45]. Nonetheless, the sizes of the moderation effects were very small, with some confidence intervals functionally at zero, and thus further interpretation of the present findings should only be done with caution.

For example, Tataranni et al. administered synthetic cortisol vs. placebo and found greater food consumption in the cortisol group [55]. This early work is supported by accumulating evidence that cortisol is associated with increased caloric intake and greater abdominal fat storage [56]. The health behavior pathway may not be independent from that of stress but rather reflect a serial mediation model, wherein weight stigma increases stress that in turn causes decrements in health behaviors. The present study contributes to the weight stigma literature in several ways. As noted, a key strength of this study is the assessment of several health behaviors within a large, national census-matched sample. Previous studies that have examined weight stigma in relation to different health behaviors have often had small sample sizes or were limited to female subjects. Thus, the present study may provide more generalizable information about health behaviors in the U.S. A related strength of the study is that higher BMI scores were well-represented in the sample, with 31.4% meeting BMI criteria for obesity. This is a closer estimate of the proportion of the American population that is classified with obesity (42%) compared to previous studies [57]. Therefore, there is greater confidence that these findings reflect the experiences of individuals with obesity in the population, aiding generalizability. Lastly, we enhance reproducibility by presenting a twostage research program of exploratory and confirmatory analyses based on recommended open science practices. There are some limitations to consider. First, a composite weight stigma score was used due to survey constraints. While early tests indicate good construct validity, additional psychometric testing is warranted (see Online Supplementary Materials 4). Another limitation is the use of selfreported weight, which is subject to inaccuracies. Additionally, the data collection period overlapped with winter holidays. Individuals may have made new years health resolutions, and therefore the self-reported health behaviors may be more indicative of newly established goals rather than typical health habits. However, such resolutions would likely dampen, rather than magnify, the relationship between weight stigma and poor health behaviors. Lastly, the study is cross-sectional and therefore causal direction cannot be determined. Weight stigma may operate as a feedback loop that leads to weight gain through certain behaviors such as comfort eating [6], but further investigation is required. Given survey constraints, weight bias internalization was not assessed. Future research should build on these findings to determine the potential role of weight bias internalization in these health behaviors. Despite these limitations, these studys findings show that weight stigma is significantly associated with several health behaviors. If future research confirms that this is indeed a causal relationship, weight stigma could cumulatively undermine physical health over time. Taken together, these findings highlight weight stigma as a potential barrier to healthy behaviors, and suggest that one strategy to improve population health may be to reduce weight stigma. Though more research is needed, it may be important to employ more weight-inclusive approaches to health promotion, such as removing stigmatizing language or weight outcomes from health policies and program objectives [5].

The study found that when people feel bad about their weight because of what others say or do, they may eat in ways that aren't healthy, drink alcohol more, and have trouble sleeping. Even people who are not very heavy can be affected by these feelings. The study didn't find a connection between feeling bad about your weight and how much you exercise.

DISCUSSION 

The present study employed a two-stage research investigation to examine the relationship between weight stigma and several health behaviors in a large sample of U.S. adults. As predicted, weight stigma was significantly associated with greater disordered eating, comfort eating, alcohol use, and sleep disturbance, after controlling for covariates. No such relationship was observed for physical activity. Targeting health behaviors (e.g., eating) to achieve weight loss is common in weight-focused health promotion policies. These policies assume that individuals can improve their health by losing weight, employing weight stigma as one strategy for motivating behavior change [5]. However, our findings indicate that weight stigma is associated with poorer health behaviors, independent of BMI. Given that physical health and weight are largely shaped by factors outside of an individuals control (i.e., genetics and social determinants like socioeconomic status) [5], it is concerning that multiple behaviors, for which individuals have some control over, may be undermined by weight stigma. Furthermore, a lower BMI may not necessarily be protective against weight stigma. In our sample, individuals across the weight spectrum, not only those with overweight or obese BMIs, reported weight stigma. In fact, moderation analyses indicated that individuals with lower BMIs showed greater disordered eating and alcohol use in the face of weight stigma. These results emerged despite individuals with higher weight reporting greater daily weight stigma. One explanation for the observed differences in health behavioral outcomes across the weight spectrum is that infrequent health behaviors may be less likely to be enacted as coping strategies. For instance, previous research has shown that alcohol use decreases as BMI increases among females with higher weight [44]. Thus, using food, instead of alcohol, may be the more common coping strategy among individuals with higher BMIs, as previous research suggests [45]. Nonetheless, the sizes of the moderation effects were very small, with some confidence intervals functionally at zero, and thus further interpretation of the present findings should only be done with caution. Prior research has found conflicting evidence for the relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. Some studies have found that greater weight stigma is associated with short-term increases in reported exercise behavior [16, 46]. Others have shown that weight stigma is positively correlated with increased exercise avoidance, but has no direct link to self-reported exercise [14, 47]. The current study adds to the latter base of evidence showing no relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. One possible explanation is that participants were asked about their daily experiences with weight stigma, which may not correspond to their level of physical activity over the past month. Ecological momentary assessment methodology may provide better insight into this relationship, as demonstrated by Vartanian et al. who examined health motivations following stigmatizing events in daily life [48]. Despite emerging evidence that weight stigma is prevalent among men [28], there is a lack of research on mens health outcomes related to weight stigma. In this study, moderation by gender was not observed for any outcome. These results are consistent with previous research reporting no gender differences in poor health outcomes such as mortality and obesity due to weight stigma [3, 49]. Men may also feel pressured to meet societal body standards and thus may display the same magnitude of associations between weight stigma and health behaviors. It is recommended that the null gender findings are interpreted with caution, as more research is needed. How might weight stigma influence an individuals health behaviors? One potential mechanism is stress. Previous work suggests that weight stigma is stressful [6, 50] and experimental lab studies manipulating weight stigma have shown that individuals with higher weight, as well as those who perceive themselves as overweight, show elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol following exposure to a weight-stigmatizing event [51, 52]. Additionally, some research has found that individuals who experience more weight-based discrimination have higher hair cortisol levelsa finding most pronounced in those at the highest BMI [53]. Individuals who experience greater stress may engage in more unhealthy coping behaviors. Indeed, stress can drive changes in behaviors such as eating, physical activity, and sleep [54].
