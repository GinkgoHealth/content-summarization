text,"WHAT ARE EXERCISE SNACKS?
To our knowledge, the term “exercise snacks” was first used by Dr Howard Hartley in a 2007 weekly news magazine article (https://www.newsweek.com/exercise-snack-plan-96095). A 2014 study by Francois et al. (19), which demonstrated the benefits of brief intermittent bouts of vigorous-intensity walking for glycemic control in individuals with insulin resistance, seems to be the first to use the term in a peer-reviewed article. The protocol in that original study involved an 11-min exercise session (6 × 1-min bouts with 1-min recovery periods) in addition to a 5-min warm-up and 3-min cooldown performed on three separate occasions during the day before meals (19). In contrast, more recent studies have adopted the term “exercise snacks” to describe isolated bouts of vigorous exercise lasting ≤1 min that are performed multiple times throughout the day (15–18). The brief nature of exercise bouts that correspond to the latter definition makes it challenging to gauge intensity based on most traditional metrics including percentages of maximal heart rate (HR) or maximal oxygen uptake (V˙O2), which may not be sensitive enough to accurately reflect the physiological demands imposed on cardiac or skeletal muscle during short bouts of vigorous activity. A similar argument can be made against the use of the Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) 6–20 scale in this scenario, which, to our knowledge, has not been validated for brief isolated bouts of vigorous exercise that typify exercise snacks. Rather, for the purpose of characterizing exercise snacks, it seems most practical to gauge relative effort, which in our published articles has resulted typically in mean values close to or greater than 5 — or a “hard” effort — on the Borg category ratio 10 (CR10) scale (15–17). As such, although our focus is on studies that fit this definition, we acknowledge the health benefits conferred by other practical variations of brief activity breaks (12,14,20) and brief vigorous exercise that could align with concepts related to our definition of exercise snacks (19,21–25).

THE EFFICACY OF EXERCISE SNACKS FOR IMPROVING CRF IN INACTIVE ADULTS
Our first exercise snacks study (15) was developed based on previous work showing a ~1 MET improvement in CRF after a 6-wk stair climbing protocol that involved 3 × 20-s hard efforts over a 10-min period performed 3 d·wk−1 (26). In the subsequent study (15), we exposed previously inactive young adults to an intervention involving either three daily bouts of vigorous stair climbing performed 1–4 h apart on 3 d·wk−1 or a no-exercise control (n = 12 per group) (15). For each stair-based exercise snack, participants were instructed to safely ascend 60 steps in a three-flight stairwell as quickly as possible. Each exercise snack was preceded by a dynamic warm-up (10 jumping jacks, 10 air squats, and 5 lunges on each side) and followed by a 1-min walking cooldown. After the 6-wk intervention, there were modest, albeit significant, improvements in CRF as measured using cycling V˙O2peak and peak power output in the exercise snacks group as compared with control (15). CRF and peak power output values in the exercise snacks group were ~5% and ~12% higher postintervention, respectively, as compared with baseline. Of note, the vigorous exercise snacks elicited mean RPE values corresponding to a “hard” effort (5 ± 1 on the Borg CR10 scale) and mean HR responses equating ~85% of the age-predicted maximum over the course of the training intervention (15).

The potential for exercise snacks to improve CRF (15) was confirmed in a study involving three isolated 20-s “all-out” cycling bouts (each with a 2-min warm-up and 1-min cooldown) performed 1–4 h apart (17). V˙O2peak and time-trial performance improved by ~4% and ~9%, respectively, over a 6-wk period in a group of 12 inactive adults (17). The CRF and performance gains with cycling-based exercise snacks seemed to be similar in magnitude to those observed in participants who were randomized to a traditional SIT protocol in this study, although the study was admittedly underpowered for between-group comparisons (Fig. 1). These results suggest that the vigorous nature of these protocols may be a more important adaptive stimulus than performing successive bouts of fatiguing exercise within a short period. In support of this supposition, an isolated 10-s sprint is sufficient to alter the concentration of intramuscular metabolites (27), and a 30-s sprint activates key intracellular signaling cascades involved in mediating training adaptation (e.g., adenosine monophosphate (AMP)–activated protein kinase) (28). These findings extended earlier work in 18 middle-aged females demonstrating a ~14% improvement in V˙O2peak when three isolated 30-s Wingate tests undertaken 4 h apart were performed thrice weekly over an 8-wk period (29).

Taken together, evidence gleaned from the aforementioned studies suggests that vigorous exercise snacks are an effective strategy to improve CRF and indices of exercise performance in previously inactive adults. Despite participants in our studies still being considered physically inactive based on the recently revised Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (i.e., by completing exercise snacks, they would not necessarily achieve 150 min of moderate-intensity or 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both each week (30)), the CRF gains conferred by the exercise snacks approach would still be expected to have health benefits (2). Importantly, for the adoption of exercise snacks by the general population outside the laboratory, the CRF gains attained using the exercise snacks approach do not require all-out efforts (15) and are apparent using both cycling-based exercise snacks and a more practical stair-based snack protocol that can be easily implemented in a home-, school-, or office-based setting.

THE FEASIBILITY OF EXERCISE SNACKS IN PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL POPULATIONS
Sedentary behavior is linked to adverse metabolic outcomes independent of CRF and physical activity levels (3,10,11), and evidence from both observational and interventional studies supports the health benefits of interrupting sedentary time with bouts of low- to moderate-intensity physical activity such as walking (12–14). Although these strategies effectively mitigate the cardiometabolic health defects arising from sedentary behavior, practical lifestyle approaches that break up prolonged periods of inactivity while simultaneously improving in CRF in populations at risk for, or diagnosed with, cardiometabolic disease (e.g., type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease) are presently limited. Relatedly, a large proportion of individuals in this demographic are elderly and have low physical fitness levels or other disease-related risk factors that may prevent participation in traditional forms of exercise that are typically well suited for healthy adults. Thus, there is an urgent need for feasible exercise strategies that can effectively improve cardiometabolic health in these populations.

Recent work from our laboratory supports the feasibility and efficacy of vigorous exercise snacks to disrupt prolonged periods of inactivity and improve cardiometabolic health markers in preclinical and clinical populations. Using a randomized crossover design, we demonstrated that breaking up 9 h of sitting with hourly bouts of vigorous stair-based exercise snacks (~15–30 s) significantly reduced the area under the curve for insulin by ~17% and nonesterified fatty acids by ~21% in 11 adults with overweight/obesity (Fig. 2) (16). Unlike our previous studies (15,17), we opted not to include a warm-up and cooldown in this study to capture what an exercise snack may look like in the real world. These preliminary findings are reinforced by a recent study from Wolfe et al. (31) that reported improvements in some measures of metabolic control when 8 h of continuous sitting was compared with a condition where participants performed 5 × 4-second maximal cycling sprints on a specialized ergometer, once per hour. Breaking up prolonged sitting with hourly sprints resulted in a ~31% reduction in postprandial plasma triglycerides and 43% increase in fat oxidation after the consumption of a high-fat meal on the morning after the experimental trial (31). The exercise protocol was not strictly an exercise snacks study per our definition here, however, because it involved a total of 20 s of maximal intensity cycling over ~4–5 min once per hour. Other reports also show the feasibility of short practical bouts of stair-based vigorous exercise in individuals with type 2 diabetes (32) and coronary artery disease (33,34), and research into the potential of exercise snacks for improving metabolic outcomes in clinical populations represents a promising avenue for future work. It will also be of interest to examine how the more vigorous exercise snacks approach discussed here compares to breaking up prolonged sitting with frequent light- to moderate-activity breaks — an approach that has previously demonstrated benefits for improving markers of metabolic control in individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes (12,14,20,35).

THE POTENTIAL FOR EXERCISE SNACKS TO IMPROVE VASCULAR HEALTH
In addition to causing metabolic disruptions, prolonged sitting also reduces leg blood flow and shear stress — factors implicated in endothelial dysfunction and the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (36,37). The detrimental effects of sedentary behavior on vascular function can be mitigated when exercise is undertaken before (38), during (39), or immediately after (40) an extended bout of prolonged sitting. In this regard, recent work from our laboratory also supports the potential for exercise snacks to improve vascular function during extended periods of sitting. Caldwell et al. (18) exposed 10 healthy males to ~8.5 h of sitting with or without hourly stair-based exercise snacks involving ~14–20 s of ascending three flights of stairs at a brisk speed. Significant improvements in femoral artery hemodynamics, but not flow-mediated dilation (FMD), were apparent when prolonged sitting was interrupted with hourly exercise snacks, as reflected by ~32% higher blood flow and vascular conductance and a ~15% increase in shear rate (18) (Fig. 3). Although we are unaware of other studies examining vascular function in response to the exercise snacks approach as defined here, our work is supported by recent observations of improved popliteal artery blood flow and shear rate in healthy adults when a postprandial 4-h sitting period is interrupted with hourly 5-min bouts of vigorous stair climbing (23). Notably, the longer stair climbing bouts used by Cho et al. (23) also offset the reduction in FMD during prolonged sitting, suggesting that longer acute bouts of exercise may be required to elicit favorable effects on this parameter of vascular function. Taken together, these findings support the potential of exercise snacks to favorably impact vascular health, although additional studies are required to confirm the findings presented here, particularly with regard to the effects of exercise snacks on vascular and endothelial function.

WHERE DO EXERCISE SNACKS FIT IN?
Exercise snacks align with the recently revised Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines on Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior (30,41). In recognition of the potential health benefits of short bouts of physical activity, the updated recommendations from these and other organizations eliminated the previous requirement that physical activity had to be accumulated in bouts lasting at least 10-min minimum (30,41). In line with this recommendation, other work has demonstrated the maintenance of health benefits when splitting longer sessions of continuous exercise into shorter bouts dispersed over the course of the day (42). Stamatakis et al. (43) recently proposed a framework encouraging four pillars of research to better understand the health benefits of a strategy called “vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity” (VILPA). These authors define VILPA as a single session of vigorous activity (≥14 or 15 on the Borg 6–20 scale or >6 MET) lasting no more than 5 min performed as part of activities of daily living or other lifestyle physical activities (43). Exercise snacks align closely with the VILPA framework in terms of their brevity, intensity, and accessibility but are technically distinct. First, unlike VILPA, exercise snacks are not purely incidental to, or inherently part of, activities of daily living but rather can be planned or structured within lifestyle activities — a distinction that still preserves the important aspects of feasibility and accessibility upon which VILPA is based. Exercise snacks also embody key elements of exercise that are not necessarily part of VILPA — namely, structure (≤1 min in duration and performed as a hard effort), planning (required some anticipation or decision making), repetition (must be performed multiple times over the day), and intention (performed for the improvement of cardiometabolic health) — further distinguishing them from the VILPA approach. Nonetheless, it becomes somewhat difficult to delineate between a purposeful exercise snack embedded within activities of daily living — for instance, vigorously ascending the stairs to use the restroom on a different floor in an office building or performing a set of jumping jacks during a break between virtual meetings — and lifestyle approaches such as incidental VILPA (e.g., carrying groceries up several flights of stairs, maximizing walking pace to the bus stop). Relatedly, although exercise snacks are sometimes compared as a more practical alternative to SIT (17), the health benefits of exercise snacks do not require “all out” efforts and can be achieved without the use of specialized cycle ergometers (15,16,18) — both of which are typical components of traditional SIT protocols. As such, we believe it is most appropriate to classify exercise snacks as a distinct subset of brief vigorous exercise (6), but we also recognize that — as with most things in science — the concept of exercise snacks proposed here is not necessarily new but rather may be an alternative iteration of an idea that has likely been presented by others in different contexts, both in the past and present.
","WHAT ARE EXERCISE SNACKS?
To our knowledge, the term “exercise snacks” was first used by Dr Howard Hartley in a 2007 weekly news magazine article (https://www.newsweek.com/exercise-snack-plan-96095). A 2014 study by Francois et al. (19), which demonstrated the benefits of brief intermittent bouts of vigorous-intensity walking for glycemic control in individuals with insulin resistance, seems to be the first to use the term in a peer-reviewed article. The protocol in that original study involved an 11-min exercise session (6 × 1-min bouts with 1-min recovery periods) in addition to a 5-min warm-up and 3-min cooldown performed on three separate occasions during the day before meals (19). In contrast, more recent studies have adopted the term “exercise snacks” to describe isolated bouts of vigorous exercise lasting ≤1 min that are performed multiple times throughout the day (15–18). The brief nature of exercise bouts that correspond to the latter definition makes it challenging to gauge intensity based on most traditional metrics including percentages of maximal heart rate (HR) or maximal oxygen uptake (V˙O2), which may not be sensitive enough to accurately reflect the physiological demands imposed on cardiac or skeletal muscle during short bouts of vigorous activity. A similar argument can be made against the use of the Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) 6–20 scale in this scenario, which, to our knowledge, has not been validated for brief isolated bouts of vigorous exercise that typify exercise snacks. Rather, for the purpose of characterizing exercise snacks, it seems most practical to gauge relative effort, which in our published articles has resulted typically in mean values close to or greater than 5 — or a “hard” effort — on the Borg category ratio 10 (CR10) scale (15–17). As such, although our focus is on studies that fit this definition, we acknowledge the health benefits conferred by other practical variations of brief activity breaks (12,14,20) and brief vigorous exercise that could align with concepts related to our definition of exercise snacks (19,21–25).

THE EFFICACY OF EXERCISE SNACKS FOR IMPROVING CRF IN INACTIVE ADULTS
Our first exercise snacks study (15) was developed based on previous work showing a ~1 MET improvement in CRF after a 6-wk stair climbing protocol that involved 3 × 20-s hard efforts over a 10-min period performed 3 d·wk−1 (26). In the subsequent study (15), we exposed previously inactive young adults to an intervention involving either three daily bouts of vigorous stair climbing performed 1–4 h apart on 3 d·wk−1 or a no-exercise control (n = 12 per group) (15). For each stair-based exercise snack, participants were instructed to safely ascend 60 steps in a three-flight stairwell as quickly as possible. Each exercise snack was preceded by a dynamic warm-up (10 jumping jacks, 10 air squats, and 5 lunges on each side) and followed by a 1-min walking cooldown. After the 6-wk intervention, there were modest, albeit significant, improvements in CRF as measured using cycling V˙O2peak and peak power output in the exercise snacks group as compared with control (15). CRF and peak power output values in the exercise snacks group were ~5% and ~12% higher postintervention, respectively, as compared with baseline. Of note, the vigorous exercise snacks elicited mean RPE values corresponding to a “hard” effort (5 ± 1 on the Borg CR10 scale) and mean HR responses equating ~85% of the age-predicted maximum over the course of the training intervention (15).

The potential for exercise snacks to improve CRF (15) was confirmed in a study involving three isolated 20-s “all-out” cycling bouts (each with a 2-min warm-up and 1-min cooldown) performed 1–4 h apart (17). V˙O2peak and time-trial performance improved by ~4% and ~9%, respectively, over a 6-wk period in a group of 12 inactive adults (17). The CRF and performance gains with cycling-based exercise snacks seemed to be similar in magnitude to those observed in participants who were randomized to a traditional SIT protocol in this study, although the study was admittedly underpowered for between-group comparisons (Fig. 1). These results suggest that the vigorous nature of these protocols may be a more important adaptive stimulus than performing successive bouts of fatiguing exercise within a short period. In support of this supposition, an isolated 10-s sprint is sufficient to alter the concentration of intramuscular metabolites (27), and a 30-s sprint activates key intracellular signaling cascades involved in mediating training adaptation (e.g., adenosine monophosphate (AMP)–activated protein kinase) (28). These findings extended earlier work in 18 middle-aged females demonstrating a ~14% improvement in V˙O2peak when three isolated 30-s Wingate tests undertaken 4 h apart were performed thrice weekly over an 8-wk period (29).

Taken together, evidence gleaned from the aforementioned studies suggests that vigorous exercise snacks are an effective strategy to improve CRF and indices of exercise performance in previously inactive adults. Despite participants in our studies still being considered physically inactive based on the recently revised Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (i.e., by completing exercise snacks, they would not necessarily achieve 150 min of moderate-intensity or 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both each week (30)), the CRF gains conferred by the exercise snacks approach would still be expected to have health benefits (2). Importantly, for the adoption of exercise snacks by the general population outside the laboratory, the CRF gains attained using the exercise snacks approach do not require all-out efforts (15) and are apparent using both cycling-based exercise snacks and a more practical stair-based snack protocol that can be easily implemented in a home-, school-, or office-based setting.

THE FEASIBILITY OF EXERCISE SNACKS IN PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL POPULATIONS
Sedentary behavior is linked to adverse metabolic outcomes independent of CRF and physical activity levels (3,10,11), and evidence from both observational and interventional studies supports the health benefits of interrupting sedentary time with bouts of low- to moderate-intensity physical activity such as walking (12–14). Although these strategies effectively mitigate the cardiometabolic health defects arising from sedentary behavior, practical lifestyle approaches that break up prolonged periods of inactivity while simultaneously improving in CRF in populations at risk for, or diagnosed with, cardiometabolic disease (e.g., type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease) are presently limited. Relatedly, a large proportion of individuals in this demographic are elderly and have low physical fitness levels or other disease-related risk factors that may prevent participation in traditional forms of exercise that are typically well suited for healthy adults. Thus, there is an urgent need for feasible exercise strategies that can effectively improve cardiometabolic health in these populations.

Recent work from our laboratory supports the feasibility and efficacy of vigorous exercise snacks to disrupt prolonged periods of inactivity and improve cardiometabolic health markers in preclinical and clinical populations. Using a randomized crossover design, we demonstrated that breaking up 9 h of sitting with hourly bouts of vigorous stair-based exercise snacks (~15–30 s) significantly reduced the area under the curve for insulin by ~17% and nonesterified fatty acids by ~21% in 11 adults with overweight/obesity (Fig. 2) (16). Unlike our previous studies (15,17), we opted not to include a warm-up and cooldown in this study to capture what an exercise snack may look like in the real world. These preliminary findings are reinforced by a recent study from Wolfe et al. (31) that reported improvements in some measures of metabolic control when 8 h of continuous sitting was compared with a condition where participants performed 5 × 4-second maximal cycling sprints on a specialized ergometer, once per hour. Breaking up prolonged sitting with hourly sprints resulted in a ~31% reduction in postprandial plasma triglycerides and 43% increase in fat oxidation after the consumption of a high-fat meal on the morning after the experimental trial (31). The exercise protocol was not strictly an exercise snacks study per our definition here, however, because it involved a total of 20 s of maximal intensity cycling over ~4–5 min once per hour. Other reports also show the feasibility of short practical bouts of stair-based vigorous exercise in individuals with type 2 diabetes (32) and coronary artery disease (33,34), and research into the potential of exercise snacks for improving metabolic outcomes in clinical populations represents a promising avenue for future work. It will also be of interest to examine how the more vigorous exercise snacks approach discussed here compares to breaking up prolonged sitting with frequent light- to moderate-activity breaks — an approach that has previously demonstrated benefits for improving markers of metabolic control in individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes (12,14,20,35).

THE POTENTIAL FOR EXERCISE SNACKS TO IMPROVE VASCULAR HEALTH
In addition to causing metabolic disruptions, prolonged sitting also reduces leg blood flow and shear stress — factors implicated in endothelial dysfunction and the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (36,37). The detrimental effects of sedentary behavior on vascular function can be mitigated when exercise is undertaken before (38), during (39), or immediately after (40) an extended bout of prolonged sitting. In this regard, recent work from our laboratory also supports the potential for exercise snacks to improve vascular function during extended periods of sitting. Caldwell et al. (18) exposed 10 healthy males to ~8.5 h of sitting with or without hourly stair-based exercise snacks involving ~14–20 s of ascending three flights of stairs at a brisk speed. Significant improvements in femoral artery hemodynamics, but not flow-mediated dilation (FMD), were apparent when prolonged sitting was interrupted with hourly exercise snacks, as reflected by ~32% higher blood flow and vascular conductance and a ~15% increase in shear rate (18) (Fig. 3). Although we are unaware of other studies examining vascular function in response to the exercise snacks approach as defined here, our work is supported by recent observations of improved popliteal artery blood flow and shear rate in healthy adults when a postprandial 4-h sitting period is interrupted with hourly 5-min bouts of vigorous stair climbing (23). Notably, the longer stair climbing bouts used by Cho et al. (23) also offset the reduction in FMD during prolonged sitting, suggesting that longer acute bouts of exercise may be required to elicit favorable effects on this parameter of vascular function. Taken together, these findings support the potential of exercise snacks to favorably impact vascular health, although additional studies are required to confirm the findings presented here, particularly with regard to the effects of exercise snacks on vascular and endothelial function.

WHERE DO EXERCISE SNACKS FIT IN?
Exercise snacks align with the recently revised Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines on Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior (30,41). In recognition of the potential health benefits of short bouts of physical activity, the updated recommendations from these and other organizations eliminated the previous requirement that physical activity had to be accumulated in bouts lasting at least 10-min minimum (30,41). In line with this recommendation, other work has demonstrated the maintenance of health benefits when splitting longer sessions of continuous exercise into shorter bouts dispersed over the course of the day (42). Stamatakis et al. (43) recently proposed a framework encouraging four pillars of research to better understand the health benefits of a strategy called “vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity” (VILPA). These authors define VILPA as a single session of vigorous activity (≥14 or 15 on the Borg 6–20 scale or >6 MET) lasting no more than 5 min performed as part of activities of daily living or other lifestyle physical activities (43). Exercise snacks align closely with the VILPA framework in terms of their brevity, intensity, and accessibility but are technically distinct. First, unlike VILPA, exercise snacks are not purely incidental to, or inherently part of, activities of daily living but rather can be planned or structured within lifestyle activities — a distinction that still preserves the important aspects of feasibility and accessibility upon which VILPA is based. Exercise snacks also embody key elements of exercise that are not necessarily part of VILPA — namely, structure (≤1 min in duration and performed as a hard effort), planning (required some anticipation or decision making), repetition (must be performed multiple times over the day), and intention (performed for the improvement of cardiometabolic health) — further distinguishing them from the VILPA approach. Nonetheless, it becomes somewhat difficult to delineate between a purposeful exercise snack embedded within activities of daily living — for instance, vigorously ascending the stairs to use the restroom on a different floor in an office building or performing a set of jumping jacks during a break between virtual meetings — and lifestyle approaches such as incidental VILPA (e.g., carrying groceries up several flights of stairs, maximizing walking pace to the bus stop).

Using a randomized crossover design, we demonstrated that breaking up 9 h of sitting with hourly bouts of vigorous stair-based exercise snacks (~15–30 s) significantly reduced the area under the curve for insulin by ~17% and nonesterified fatty acids by ~21% in 11 adults with overweight/obesity (Fig. 2) (16). Unlike our previous studies (15,17), we opted not to include a warm-up and cooldown in this study to capture what an exercise snack may look like in the real world. These preliminary findings are reinforced by a recent study from Wolfe et al. (31) that reported improvements in some measures of metabolic control when 8 h of continuous sitting was compared with a condition where participants performed 5 × 4-second maximal cycling sprints on a specialized ergometer, once per hour. Breaking up prolonged sitting with hourly sprints resulted in a ~31% reduction in postprandial plasma triglycerides and 43% increase in fat oxidation after the consumption of a high-fat meal on the morning after the experimental trial (31). The exercise protocol was not strictly an exercise snacks study per our definition here, however, because it involved a total of 20 s of maximal intensity cycling over ~4–5 min once per hour. Other reports also show the feasibility of short practical bouts of stair-based vigorous exercise in individuals with type 2 diabetes (32) and coronary artery disease (33,34), and research into the potential of exercise snacks for improving metabolic outcomes in clinical populations represents a promising avenue for future work. It will also be of interest to examine how the more vigorous exercise snacks approach discussed here compares to breaking up prolonged sitting with frequent light- to moderate-activity breaks — an approach that has previously demonstrated benefits for improving markers of metabolic control in individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes (12,14,20,35).

THE POTENTIAL FOR EXERCISE SNACKS TO IMPROVE VASCULAR HEALTH
In addition to causing metabolic disruptions, prolonged sitting also reduces leg blood flow and shear stress — factors implicated in endothelial dysfunction and the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (36,37). The detrimental effects of sedentary behavior on vascular function can be mitigated when exercise is undertaken before (38), during (39), or immediately after (40) an extended bout of prolonged sitting. In this regard, recent work from our laboratory also supports the potential for exercise snacks to improve vascular function during extended periods of sitting. Caldwell et al. (18) exposed 10 healthy males to ~8.5 h of sitting with or without hourly stair-based exercise snacks involving ~14–20 s of ascending three flights of stairs at a brisk speed. Significant improvements in femoral artery hemodynamics, but not flow-mediated dilation (FMD), were apparent when prolonged sitting was interrupted with hourly exercise snacks, as reflected by ~32% higher blood flow and vascular conductance and a ~15% increase in shear rate (18) (Fig. 3). Although we are unaware of other studies examining vascular function in response to the exercise snacks approach as defined here, our work is supported by recent observations of improved popliteal artery blood flow and shear rate in healthy adults when a postprandial 4-h sitting period is interrupted with hourly 5-min bouts of vigorous stair climbing (23). Notably, the longer stair climbing bouts used by Cho et al. (23) also offset the reduction in FMD during prolonged sitting, suggesting that longer acute bouts of exercise may be required to elicit favorable effects on this parameter of vascular function. Taken together, these findings support the potential of exercise snacks to favorably impact vascular health, although additional studies are required to confirm the findings presented here, particularly with regard to the effects of exercise snacks on vascular and endothelial function.

WHERE DO EXERCISE SNACKS FIT IN?
Exercise snacks align with the recently revised Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines on Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior (30,41). In recognition of the potential health benefits of short bouts of physical activity, the updated recommendations from these and other organizations eliminated the previous requirement that physical activity had to be accumulated in bouts lasting at least 10-min minimum (30,41). In line with this recommendation, other work has demonstrated the maintenance of health benefits when splitting longer sessions of continuous exercise into shorter bouts dispersed over the course of the day (42). Stamatakis et al. (43) recently proposed a framework encouraging four pillars of research to better understand the health benefits of a strategy called “vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity” (VILPA). These authors define VILPA as a single session of vigorous activity (≥14 or 15 on the Borg 6–20 scale or >6 MET) lasting no more than 5 min performed as part of activities of daily living or other lifestyle physical activities (43). Exercise snacks align closely with the VILPA framework in terms of their brevity, intensity, and accessibility but are technically distinct. First, unlike VILPA, exercise snacks are not purely incidental to, or inherently part of, activities of daily living but rather can be planned or structured within lifestyle activities — a distinction that still preserves the important aspects of feasibility and accessibility upon which VILPA is based. Exercise snacks also embody key elements of exercise that are not necessarily part of VILPA — namely, structure (≤1 min in duration and performed as a hard effort), planning (required some anticipation or decision making), repetition (must be performed multiple times over the day), and intention (performed for the improvement of cardiometabolic health) — further distinguishing them from the VILPA approach. Nonetheless, it becomes somewhat difficult to delineate between a purposeful exercise snack embedded within activities of daily living — for instance, vigorously ascending the stairs to use the restroom on a different floor in an office building or performing a set of jumping jacks during a break between virtual meetings — and lifestyle approaches such as incidental VILPA (e.g., carrying groceries up several flights of stairs, maximizing walking pace to the bus stop). Relatedly, although exercise snacks are sometimes compared as a more practical alternative to SIT (17), the health benefits of exercise snacks do not require “all out” efforts and can be achieved without the use of specialized cycle ergometers (15,16,18) — both of which are typical components of traditional SIT protocols. As such, we believe it is most appropriate to classify exercise snacks as a distinct subset of brief vigorous exercise (6), but we also recognize that — as with most things in science — the concept of exercise snacks proposed here is not necessarily new but rather may be an alternative iteration of an idea that has likely been presented by others in different contexts, both in the past and present.
","Homeostatic and non-homeostatic appetite control along the spectrum of physical activity levels an updated perspective

284 5. The impact of physical activity and exercise on the mechanisms of appetite control 
285 Emerging studies are shedding light on the mechanisms contributing to the proposed 
286 dysregulation of appetite at lower levels of PA and more sensitive appetite control at higher 
287 levels of PA. These mechanisms may not necessarily be the same along the whole spectrum 
288 of PA levels. Acutely, exercise has been shown to influence gastric emptying [78], attenuate 
289 the release of ghrelin and increase the secretion of PYY, GLP-1 and pancreatic polypeptide 
290 [79]. Chronic exercise may increase the postprandial secretion of GLP-1 and PYY [80]. 
291 Therefore, habitual PA (and exercise) may interact with food intake to enhance hormonal 
292 satiety signalling [81]. Moreover, regular PA and exercise training are associated with several 
293 other physiological adaptations such as improved sensitivity to insulin [82] and leptin [83, 84], 
294 substrate metabolism [85], and body composition [86], which have been proposed as 
295 mechanisms involved in food intake and eating behaviour [87, 88]. Evidence suggests that PA 
296 influences appetite control through a dual-process action which increases the drive to eat but 
297 also post-meal satiety [89]. Several studies have now demonstrated that physically active 
298 individuals show better energy compensation than their less active counterparts following 
299 consumption of preloads differing in energy content such that they reduce EI to offset the 
300 difference in energy consumed from the preloads [10, 90-94]. This preload-test meal paradigm 
301 is effective in measuring the strength of satiety [95]. These improvements in satiety may be 
302 associated with exercise-induced adaptations in episodic satiety signalling [80, 91, 96] or
303 gastric emptying [97]. In contrast, we have shown that satiation does not appear to be 
14
304 influenced by PA level in non-obese individuals when measured with a passive 
305 overconsumption paradigm comparing ad libitum EI at meals high in fat or carbohydrate [9]. 
306 However, in overweight and obese individuals, Caudwell et al. [1] showed that exercise 
307 training led to a reduction in EI at a high-fat/energy dense test meal. This may be associated 
308 with enhanced satiation, but given the homeostatic and non-homeostatic determinants of food 
309 intake, may also reflect changes in food hedonics or behavioural traits. 
310 While there is strong support that habitual PA affects homeostatic mechanisms 
311 controlling food intake, less is known on its effect on non-homeostatic processes, and their 
312 contribution to appetite control along the spectrum of PA levels. Indeed, secondary analyses 
313 from the study from Caudwell et al. [1] revealed a reduction in hedonic wanting for high-fat 
314 foods relative to low-fat foods (Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire), disinhibition and binge 
315 eating following exercise training [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. Furthermore, another 
316 study from our group found inverse associations between time spent in MVPA and disinhibition 
317 and binge eating, but these did not remain significant after controlling for body fat [24]. This 
318 corroborates a study by Shook et al. who found greater disinhibition in their lowest quintile of 
319 MVPA but not when controlling for body weight [77], and the aforementioned reduction in 
320 disinhibition and binge eating score following 12 weeks of exercise training which did not 
321 remain significant after controlling for change in body fat [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. 
322 These differences in disinhibition and binge eating were not apparent in non-obese individuals 
323 varying in PA levels [9, 10], suggesting the influence of habitual PA on eating behaviour traits 
324 may be more strongly influenced by body composition. In terms of food hedonics, differences 
325 in the rewarding value of foods (liking and wanting) have been observed in lean active 
326 compared to overweight inactive males [98], but in non-obese individuals, PA level did not 
327 influence liking and wanting for high-fat food in the hungry or fed states [9, 10]. In inactive 
328 individuals with overweight and obesity, 12 weeks of exercise training (125-250 kcal per 
329 exercise session) did not affect liking or wanting [99], whereas another 12-week intervention 
330 at a higher dose of exercise (500 kcal per exercise session) reduced the hedonic wanting for 
15
331 high-fat food independent of changes in body fat [Beaulieu et al. unpublished results]. 
332 Moreover, habitual (self-reported) PA may differently impact food cravings depending on 
333 exercise type and sex [100]. These studies suggest there may be differing effects of PA on
334 non-homeostatic appetite control according to an individual’s body fat status, sex, and dose 
335 and type of PA. 
336 Therefore, we can propose that in addition to individuals with non-regulated appetite 
337 having blunted satiety signalling, excess body fat in these individuals may amplify non 338 homeostatic inputs favouring overconsumption. In contrast, individuals with regulated appetite 
339 with higher levels of PA have enhanced postprandial sensitivity, allowing for EI to be better 
340 matched to EE in response to hunger and satiety signals. This is demonstrated in an updated 
341 perspective of the zones of appetite control in Figure 3.

350 6. Interaction between physical activity and diet composition on energy intake and 
351 energy balance 
352 While PA appears to affect several mechanisms of appetite control, as described 
353 above, whether it renders individuals less susceptible to overconsumption in the current 
354 obesogenic food environment has not been extensively examined. This is important to 
355 consider, with headlines stating “You cannot outrun a bad diet” [101]. Only a few studies have 
356 investigated the impact of PA and diet composition on EI and energy balance. A study by 
357 Tremblay et al. [102] in males found that consumption of a high-fat diet over two days following 
358 a 500-kcal exercise bout led to a positive energy balance, whereas consumption of a low-fat 
359 diet was able to maintain the energy deficit produced by exercise. Along those lines, 
360 Murgatroyd et al. [103] showed in males that increasing the dietary fat content (and energy 
361 density) of an ad libitum diet in a day where exercise was imposed (~675 kcal) increased EI 
362 and led to a positive energy balance (albeit not statistically significant). Moreover, consumption 
363 of a high-fat diet while imposing inactivity resulted in a daily positive energy balance of 
364 approximately 1000 kcal more than with imposed exercise, and 1200 kcal more than with 
365 exercise on a low-fat diet. Other studies in males [104] and females [105] corroborated these 
366 findings by demonstrating that the consumption of a high-fat meal following an exercise bout 
367 resulted in significantly greater relative EI (after considering the EE of the exercise) compared 
368 with a low-fat meal. Interestingly, palatability of both high-fat and low-fat meals increased after 
369 exercise compared to rest in females, but not in males [105]. These studies highlight the 
370 potency of the phenomenon of passive overconsumption. Therefore, the degree of 
371 compensation observed in response to PAEE can readily be modulated simply by altering the
372 energy density of the diet and proposals about compensation need to be interpreted with care. 
17
373 Whether being habitually physically active enhances the response to dietary 
374 manipulations is also of interest. As discussed above, we have shown that physically active 
375 individuals are also prone to acute passive overconsumption with an imposed high-fat meal 
376 [9]. In addition, while individuals with higher levels of PA were found to be sensitive to the 
377 acute nutritional manipulation of preloads varying in energy content by reducing EI at the 
378 following meal, objectively-measured daily EI (including the preload) was greater after a high 379 energy relative to a low-energy preload regardless of PA level, demonstrating an effect of 
380 passive overconsumption [10]. Others have shown that active individuals may compensate 
381 beyond the immediate meal following intake of a high-energy preload, attenuating the risk of 
382 overconsumption, but this was measured with food records and daily EI including the preload 
383 was not reported [90, 91, 93]. The long-term compensatory response to high energy density 
384 food consumption in physically active individuals is unknown. The EE associated with PA may 
385 be helpful in mitigating episodes of overconsumption and fluctuations in EI over time [106, 
386 107]. However, given the available evidence, in the general population, higher levels of 
387 habitual PA in conjunction with a diet lower in energy density appear to be optimal for appetite 
388 control and energy balance. 
389
390 7. Implications and future directions 
391 The impact of PA on the mechanisms of appetite control has implications for individuals 
392 wishing to lose fat mass through exercise as large variability in the individual response to 
393 exercise interventions have been observed [89, 108]. These varying responses in fat loss to 
394 exercise training suggest that some individuals compensate for the increase in PA (and EE) 
395 through greater food intake or other mechanisms impacting on energy balance, minimizing 
396 the effect of exercise on fat loss. In both those susceptible and resistant to exercise-induced 
397 weight loss, hunger and the strength of satiety were enhanced with exercise training, showing 
398 a robust effect of the dual-process action of PA on appetite control; however, the increase in 
18
399 hunger was greater in those resistant to weight loss [89]. The compensatory adaptations in 
400 appetite control and eating behaviour following exercise-induced weight loss are beyond the 
401 scope of this review and have been reviewed elsewhere [20, 109, 110]. Nevertheless, it should 
402 be acknowledged that certain baseline (pre-intervention) characteristics of appetite may 
403 predict the susceptibility to exercise-induced weight loss such as the hedonic response to 
404 acute exercise [111] and the peptide response to food consumption [112], which is of interest 
405 for future research to help personalise interventions to promote successful fat loss with 
406 exercise. 
407 The role of PAEE in driving EI is important for future research to clarify as it can make 
408 up a significant proportion of TDEE in physically active individuals (see Figure 1) [113]. While 
409 the influence of PA on some processes of appetite appear to be independent of body fat, more 
410 research is required to understand the role of body composition and body fat status in the 
411 relationship between PA level and appetite control. We have reported above that PA (or 
412 factors associated with PA) may moderate the relationship between fat mass and EI, which is 
413 an interesting avenue for future research. Other potential moderators of the relationship 
414 between PA and appetite that remain to be examined further include sex [114] and age [93]. 
415 Additionally, very little is known on how the type, dose, intensity and timing of habitual PA and 
416 exercise affect homeostatic and non-homeostatic appetite. The mechanisms responsible for 
417 the apparent enhancement in the satiety response to food consumption in physically active
418 individuals also remain to be fully elucidated. Finally, in light of the research on the interaction 
419 between PA and dietary manipulations, it is important for future research to take an energy 
420 balance perspective [115] to increase our understanding of the complex relationships and 
421 interactions among PA, diet composition, body composition and appetite control along the 
422 spectrum of PA levels. 
423
424 8. Summary 
19
425 Food intake is modulated by several homeostatic and non-homeostatic mechanisms 
426 controlling appetite. Evidence is accumulating to support the view that EI along the spectrum 
427 of PA is J-shaped, with individuals with low levels of PA being in a non-regulated zone of 
428 appetite whereas those with higher levels of PA operating in a regulated zone with more 
429 sensitive appetite control. Body fat also varies along the spectrum of PA and may impact the 
430 sensitivity of satiety signals and non-homeostatic inputs (food hedonics and behavioural traits) 
431 favouring overconsumption at lower levels of PA, but this remains to be fully understood. PA
432 affects the homeostatic mechanisms of appetite via a proposed dual-process action of
433 increased drive to eat from greater EE, but also by enhanced satiety response to food, likely 
434 through more sensitive postprandial signalling. An important tenet of our current position is 
435 that PAEE is a determinant of EI (although with greater variability than RMR). These 
436 processes generate a better adjustment of EI to EE in response to hunger and satiety signals 
437 at higher levels of PA. However, special attention needs to be given to diet composition, with 
438 a high-fat energy-dense diet leading to acute passive overconsumption of energy along the 
439 entire spectrum of PA. Importantly, the strength of the various mechanisms and determinants 
440 of appetite will vary between individuals along the spectrum of PA, highlighting the need to 
441 recognise that the impact of PA on appetite control is not a case of ‘one size fits all’.

388 control and energy balance.

407 The role of PAEE in driving EI is important for future research to clarify as it can make

409 the influence of PA on some processes of appetite appear to be independent of body fat, more

411 relationship between PA level and appetite control. We have reported above that PA (or 
412 factors associated with PA) may moderate the relationship between fat mass and EI, which is 
413 an interesting avenue for future research. Other potential moderators of the relationship 
414 between PA and appetite that remain to be examined further include sex [114] and age [93]. 
415 Additionally, very little is known on how the type, dose, intensity and timing of habitual PA and 
416 exercise affect homeostatic and non-homeostatic appetite. The mechanisms responsible for 
417 the apparent enhancement in the satiety response to food consumption in physically active
418 individuals also remain to be fully elucidated. Finally, in light of the research on the interaction 
419 between PA and dietary manipulations, it is important for future research to take an energy 
420 balance perspective [115] to increase our understanding of the complex relationships and 
421 interactions among PA, diet composition, body composition and appetite control along the 
422 spectrum of PA levels.

424 8. Summary 
19
425 Food intake is modulated by several homeostatic and non-homeostatic mechanisms 
426 controlling appetite. Evidence is accumulating to support the view that EI along the spectrum 
427 of PA is J-shaped, with individuals with low levels of PA being in a non-regulated zone of 
428 appetite whereas those with higher levels of PA operating in a regulated zone with more 
429 sensitive appetite control. Body fat also varies along the spectrum of PA and may impact the 
430 sensitivity of satiety signals and non-homeostatic inputs (food hedonics and behavioural traits) 
431 favouring overconsumption at lower levels of PA, but this remains to be fully understood. PA
432 affects the homeostatic mechanisms of appetite via a proposed dual-process action of
433 increased drive to eat from greater EE, but also by enhanced satiety response to food, likely 
434 through more sensitive postprandial signalling. An important tenet of our current position is 
435 that PAEE is a determinant of EI (although with greater variability than RMR). These 
436 processes generate a better adjustment of EI to EE in response to hunger and satiety signals 
437 at higher levels of PA. However, special attention needs to be given to diet composition, with 
438 a high-fat energy-dense diet leading to acute passive overconsumption of energy along the 
439 entire spectrum of PA. Importantly, the strength of the various mechanisms and determinants 
440 of appetite will vary between individuals along the spectrum of PA, highlighting the need to 
441 recognise that the impact of PA on appetite control is not a case of ‘one size fits all’.

","Homeostatic and non-homeostatic appetite control along the spectrum of physical activity levels an updated perspective

284 5. The impact of physical activity and exercise on the mechanisms of appetite control 
285 Emerging studies are shedding light on the mechanisms contributing to the proposed 
286 dysregulation of appetite at lower levels of PA and more sensitive appetite control at higher 
287 levels of PA. These mechanisms may not necessarily be the same along the whole spectrum 
288 of PA levels. Acutely, exercise has been shown to influence gastric emptying [78], attenuate 
289 the release of ghrelin and increase the secretion of PYY, GLP-1 and pancreatic polypeptide 
290 [79]. Chronic exercise may increase the postprandial secretion of GLP-1 and PYY [80]. 
291 Therefore, habitual PA (and exercise) may interact with food intake to enhance hormonal 
292 satiety signalling [81]. Moreover, regular PA and exercise training are associated with several 
293 other physiological adaptations such as improved sensitivity to insulin [82] and leptin [83, 84], 
294 substrate metabolism [85], and body composition [86], which have been proposed as 
295 mechanisms involved in food intake and eating behaviour [87, 88]. Evidence suggests that PA 
296 influences appetite control through a dual-process action which increases the drive to eat but 
297 also post-meal satiety [89]. Several studies have now demonstrated that physically active 
298 individuals show better energy compensation than their less active counterparts following 
299 consumption of preloads differing in energy content such that they reduce EI to offset the 
300 difference in energy consumed from the preloads [10, 90-94]. This preload-test meal paradigm 
301 is effective in measuring the strength of satiety [95]. These improvements in satiety may be 
302 associated with exercise-induced adaptations in episodic satiety signalling [80, 91, 96] or
303 gastric emptying [97]. In contrast, we have shown that satiation does not appear to be 
14
304 influenced by PA level in non-obese individuals when measured with a passive 
305 overconsumption paradigm comparing ad libitum EI at meals high in fat or carbohydrate [9]. 
306 However, in overweight and obese individuals, Caudwell et al. [1] showed that exercise 
307 training led to a reduction in EI at a high-fat/energy dense test meal. This may be associated 
308 with enhanced satiation, but given the homeostatic and non-homeostatic determinants of food 
309 intake, may also reflect changes in food hedonics or behavioural traits. 
310 While there is strong support that habitual PA affects homeostatic mechanisms 
311 controlling food intake, less is known on its effect on non-homeostatic processes, and their 
312 contribution to appetite control along the spectrum of PA levels. Indeed, secondary analyses 
313 from the study from Caudwell et al. [1] revealed a reduction in hedonic wanting for high-fat 
314 foods relative to low-fat foods (Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire), disinhibition and binge 
315 eating following exercise training [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. Furthermore, another 
316 study from our group found inverse associations between time spent in MVPA and disinhibition 
317 and binge eating, but these did not remain significant after controlling for body fat [24]. This 
318 corroborates a study by Shook et al. who found greater disinhibition in their lowest quintile of 
319 MVPA but not when controlling for body weight [77], and the aforementioned reduction in 
320 disinhibition and binge eating score following 12 weeks of exercise training which did not 
321 remain significant after controlling for change in body fat [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. 
322 These differences in disinhibition and binge eating were not apparent in non-obese individuals 
323 varying in PA levels [9, 10], suggesting the influence of habitual PA on eating behaviour traits 
324 may be more strongly influenced by body composition. In terms of food hedonics, differences 
325 in the rewarding value of foods (liking and wanting) have been observed in lean active 
326 compared to overweight inactive males [98], but in non-obese individuals, PA level did not 
327 influence liking and wanting for high-fat food in the hungry or fed states [9, 10]. In inactive 
328 individuals with overweight and obesity, 12 weeks of exercise training (125-250 kcal per 
329 exercise session) did not affect liking or wanting [99], whereas another 12-week intervention 
330 at a higher dose of exercise (500 kcal per exercise session) reduced the hedonic wanting for 
15
331 high-fat food independent of changes in body fat [Beaulieu et al. unpublished results]. 
332 Moreover, habitual (self-reported) PA may differently impact food cravings depending on 
333 exercise type and sex [100]. These studies suggest there may be differing effects of PA on
334 non-homeostatic appetite control according to an individual’s body fat status, sex, and dose 
335 and type of PA. 
336 Therefore, we can propose that in addition to individuals with non-regulated appetite 
337 having blunted satiety signalling, excess body fat in these individuals may amplify non 338 homeostatic inputs favouring overconsumption. In contrast, individuals with regulated appetite 
339 with higher levels of PA have enhanced postprandial sensitivity, allowing for EI to be better 
340 matched to EE in response to hunger and satiety signals. This is demonstrated in an updated 
341 perspective of the zones of appetite control in Figure 3.

350 6. Interaction between physical activity and diet composition on energy intake and 
351 energy balance 
352 While PA appears to affect several mechanisms of appetite control, as described 
353 above, whether it renders individuals less susceptible to overconsumption in the current 
354 obesogenic food environment has not been extensively examined. This is important to 
355 consider, with headlines stating “You cannot outrun a bad diet” [101]. Only a few studies have 
356 investigated the impact of PA and diet composition on EI and energy balance. A study by 
357 Tremblay et al. [102] in males found that consumption of a high-fat diet over two days following 
358 a 500-kcal exercise bout led to a positive energy balance, whereas consumption of a low-fat 
359 diet was able to maintain the energy deficit produced by exercise. Along those lines, 
360 Murgatroyd et al. [103] showed in males that increasing the dietary fat content (and energy 
361 density) of an ad libitum diet in a day where exercise was imposed (~675 kcal) increased EI 
362 and led to a positive energy balance (albeit not statistically significant). Moreover, consumption 
363 of a high-fat diet while imposing inactivity resulted in a daily positive energy balance of 
364 approximately 1000 kcal more than with imposed exercise, and 1200 kcal more than with 
365 exercise on a low-fat diet. Other studies in males [104] and females [105] corroborated these 
366 findings by demonstrating that the consumption of a high-fat meal following an exercise bout 
367 resulted in significantly greater relative EI (after considering the EE of the exercise) compared 
368 with a low-fat meal. Interestingly, palatability of both high-fat and low-fat meals increased after 
369 exercise compared to rest in females, but not in males [105]. These studies highlight the 
370 potency of the phenomenon of passive overconsumption. Therefore, the degree of 
371 compensation observed in response to PAEE can readily be modulated simply by altering the
372 energy density of the diet and proposals about compensation need to be interpreted with care. 
17
373 Whether being habitually physically active enhances the response to dietary 
374 manipulations is also of interest. As discussed above, we have shown that physically active 
375 individuals are also prone to acute passive overconsumption with an imposed high-fat meal 
376 [9]. In addition, while individuals with higher levels of PA were found to be sensitive to the 
377 acute nutritional manipulation of preloads varying in energy content by reducing EI at the 
378 following meal, objectively-measured daily EI (including the preload) was greater after a high 379 energy relative to a low-energy preload regardless of PA level, demonstrating an effect of 
380 passive overconsumption [10]. Others have shown that active individuals may compensate 
381 beyond the immediate meal following intake of a high-energy preload, attenuating the risk of 
382 overconsumption, but this was measured with food records and daily EI including the preload 
383 was not reported [90, 91, 93]. The long-term compensatory response to high energy density 
384 food consumption in physically active individuals is unknown. The EE associated with PA may 
385 be helpful in mitigating episodes of overconsumption and fluctuations in EI over time [106, 
386 107]. However, given the available evidence, in the general population, higher levels of 
387 habitual PA in conjunction with a diet lower in energy density appear to be optimal for appetite 
388 control and energy balance. 
389
390 7. Implications and future directions 
391 The impact of PA on the mechanisms of appetite control has implications for individuals 
392 wishing to lose fat mass through exercise as large variability in the individual response to 
393 exercise interventions have been observed [89, 108]. These varying responses in fat loss to 
394 exercise training suggest that some individuals compensate for the increase in PA (and EE) 
395 through greater food intake or other mechanisms impacting on energy balance, minimizing 
396 the effect of exercise on fat loss. In both those susceptible and resistant to exercise-induced 
397 weight loss, hunger and the strength of satiety were enhanced with exercise training, showing 
398 a robust effect of the dual-process action of PA on appetite control; however, the increase in 
18
399 hunger was greater in those resistant to weight loss [89]. The compensatory adaptations in 
400 appetite control and eating behaviour following exercise-induced weight loss are beyond the 
401 scope of this review and have been reviewed elsewhere [20, 109, 110]. Nevertheless, it should 
402 be acknowledged that certain baseline (pre-intervention) characteristics of appetite may 
403 predict the susceptibility to exercise-induced weight loss such as the hedonic response to 
404 acute exercise [111] and the peptide response to food consumption [112], which is of interest 
405 for future research to help personalise interventions to promote successful fat loss with 
406 exercise. 
407 The role of PAEE in driving EI is important for future research to clarify as it can make 
408 up a significant proportion of TDEE in physically active individuals (see Figure 1) [113]. While 
409 the influence of PA on some processes of appetite appear to be independent of body fat, more 
410 research is required to understand the role of body composition and body fat status in the 
411 relationship between PA level and appetite control. We have reported above that PA (or 
412 factors associated with PA) may moderate the relationship between fat mass and EI, which is 
413 an interesting avenue for future research. Other potential moderators of the relationship 
414 between PA and appetite that remain to be examined further include sex [114] and age [93]. 
415 Additionally, very little is known on how the type, dose, intensity and timing of habitual PA and 
416 exercise affect homeostatic and non-homeostatic appetite. The mechanisms responsible for 
417 the apparent enhancement in the satiety response to food consumption in physically active
418 individuals also remain to be fully elucidated. Finally, in light of the research on the interaction 
419 between PA and dietary manipulations, it is important for future research to take an energy 
420 balance perspective [115] to increase our understanding of the complex relationships and 
421 interactions among PA, diet composition, body composition and appetite control along the 
422 spectrum of PA levels.
