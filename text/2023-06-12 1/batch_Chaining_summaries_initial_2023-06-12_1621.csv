Discussion
This nutritional approach using high calcium and high protein dairy foods to increase calcium and protein intakes in institutionalised older adults replete in vitamin D was associated with a 33% reduction in risk of fractures of any type, a 46% reduction in risk of hip fractures, and an 11% reduction in risk of falls relative to controls. We found no group difference in all cause mortality.
Most interventions aimed at reducing fracture risk target a drug therapy to people with osteoporosis because they are at high risk of fracture. This approach confers a large benefit to the individual and does so cost effectively, because few people need to be treated to avert one event. However, averting fractures in small numbers of people at high risk does not reduce the burden of fractures in the community.
The population burden of fracturesthe number of events, morbidity, mortality, and cost to the communityarises from the vast numbers of people with risk factors that confer a modest attributable risk to the individual.17 For example, most fragility fractures in the community arise among women with osteopenia (bone mineral density T score 2.5 to 1 SD) because they form the largest segment of the community.18 Likewise, most fractures attributable to nutritional inadequacy arise among the great many people with intakes of calcium and protein that are below recommended levels.19 This nutritional inadequacy confers a small attributable risk to the individual but accounts for a large attributable fraction of the fracture burden in the community as a whole. This is the Geoffrey Rose prevention paradoxa community based approach producing a small benefit to an individual may still confer a large benefit to the community.17 Safety is essential because most individuals treated may derive little or no benefit from the intervention. For example, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension study reduced blood pressure by replacing a western diet with a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, and low fat dairy foodsan approach associated with fewer cardiovascular events.20
Comparison with other studies
Most nutrition based studies assessing antifracture efficacy in aged care residents and people in the community used pharmacological doses of calcium with or without vitamin D.21 In a meta-analysis of 17 of these studies, only two studies reported a reduction in fracture riska study of nursing home residents with calcium intakes <600 mg/day and vitamin D concentrations <50 nmol/L and a community based study in women and men ?65 years of age with mean calcium intakes of 700 mg/day.21 In the remaining 15 studies, poor compliance, large numbers of dropouts, and a low prevalence of the risk factor may have contributed to the null findings.2223 Benefits are unlikely if the prevalence of a risk factor (such as inadequate calcium and protein intakes) is low.24 For example, in the meta-analysis, reduction in fracture risk reported with treatment was confined to the 7272 individuals with calcium intakes <700 mg/day (risk ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.89), not the 45?241 individuals with calcium intakes above 700 mg daily.21 The reduction in fracture risk observed with calcium and protein rich foods in this study may have been the result of attention to several of the above factors. Compliance was optimised by supervised provision and consumption of the foods. Participants lost to follow-up were replaced by newly admitted residents. We intentionally targeted a cohort at high risk for fracture in whom low calcium and protein intakes were common and so were likely to partly contribute to the already high fracture burden in this community.
Mechanisms of fracture risk reduction
This nutritional intervention produced two unanticipated novel observations. The risk reduction for falls and fractures was detected by three and five months, respectively, and the relative risk reduction for fractures was similar to that found in trials using potent antiresorptive therapy to treat people at high risk due to osteoporosis. The two most likely explanations for each of these observations is a risk reduction for falls and slowing progression of bone fragility. Insulin-like growth factor 1 increased in the intervention group only, whereas the decrease in appendicular lean mass was confined to controls, consistent with the notion that protein intakes of 1-1.5 g/kg/day is needed to prevent protein catabolism and preserve or increase muscle mass in older adults, particularly those at risk of malnutrition or frailty.25 The increase in serum C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and deterioration in tibial and radial total volumetric bone mineral density in controls was not seen in the intervention group, consistent with slowing of bone loss and slowing of microstructural deterioration.26 These changes were modest, but slowing microstructural deterioration disproportionately reduces progression of bone fragility because fragility increases as a power function to the bone loss producing it.27
Mortality did not differ between the groups. Some, but not all, studies suggest that milk consumption is associated with increased mortality but consumption of yoghurt and cheese (fermented foods) with reduced mortality and favourable blood lipid profiles.282930 Fermented and non-fermented dairy foods were used during the intervention. Milk consumption did not differ between the intervention and control groups (data not shown).","Think about why this might be relevant for the audience in the grand scheme of things.

Discussion
The present study employed a two-stage research investigation to examine the relationship between weight stigma and several health behaviors in a large sample of U.S. adults. As predicted, weight stigma was significantly associated with greater disordered eating, comfort eating, alcohol use, and sleep disturbance, after controlling for covariates. No such relationship was observed for physical activity.
Targeting health behaviors (e.g., eating) to achieve weight loss is common in weight-focused health promotion policies. These policies assume that individuals can improve their health by losing weight, employing weight stigma as one strategy for motivating behavior change [5]. However, our findings indicate that weight stigma is associated with poorer health behaviors, independent of BMI. Given that physical health and weight are largely shaped by factors outside of an individuals control (i.e., genetics and social determinants like socioeconomic status) [5], it is concerning that multiple behaviors, for which individuals have some control over, may be undermined by weight stigma.
Furthermore, a lower BMI may not necessarily be protective against weight stigma. In our sample, individuals across the weight spectrum, not only those with overweight or obese BMIs, reported weight stigma. In fact, moderation analyses indicated that individuals with lower BMIs showed greater disordered eating and alcohol use in the face of weight stigma. These results emerged despite individuals with higher weight reporting greater daily weight stigma. One explanation for the observed differences in health behavioral outcomes across the weight spectrum is that infrequent health behaviors may be less likely to be enacted as coping strategies. For instance, previous research has shown that alcohol use decreases as BMI increases among females with higher weight [44]. Thus, using food, instead of alcohol, may be the more common coping strategy among individuals with higher BMIs, as previous research suggests [45]. Nonetheless, the sizes of the moderation effects were very small, with some confidence intervals functionally at zero, and thus further interpretation of the present findings should only be done with caution.
Prior research has found conflicting evidence for the relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. Some studies have found that greater weight stigma is associated with short-term increases in reported exercise behavior [16, 46]. Others have shown that weight stigma is positively correlated with increased exercise avoidance, but has no direct link to self-reported exercise [14, 47]. The current study adds to the latter base of evidence showing no relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. One possible explanation is that participants were asked about their daily experiences with weight stigma, which may not correspond to their level of physical activity over the past month. Ecological momentary assessment methodology may provide better insight into this relationship, as demonstrated by Vartanian et al. who examined health motivations following stigmatizing events in daily life [48].
Despite emerging evidence that weight stigma is prevalent among men [28], there is a lack of research on mens health outcomes related to weight stigma. In this study, moderation by gender was not observed for any outcome. These results are consistent with previous research reporting no gender differences in poor health outcomes such as mortality and obesity due to weight stigma [3, 49]. Men may also feel pressured to meet societal body standards and thus may display the same magnitude of associations between weight stigma and health behaviors. It is recommended that the null gender findings are interpreted with caution, as more research is needed.
How might weight stigma influence an individuals health behaviors? One potential mechanism is stress. Previous work suggests that weight stigma is stressful [6, 50] and experimental lab studies manipulating weight stigma have shown that individuals with higher weight, as well as those who perceive themselves as overweight, show elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol following exposure to a weight-stigmatizing event [51, 52]. Additionally, some research has found that individuals who experience more weight-based discrimination have higher hair cortisol levelsa finding most pronounced in those at the highest BMI [53]. Individuals who experience greater stress may engage in more unhealthy coping behaviors. Indeed, stress can drive changes in behaviors such as eating, physical activity, and sleep [54]. For example, Tataranni et al. administered synthetic cortisol vs. placebo and found greater food consumption in the cortisol group [55]. This early work is supported by accumulating evidence that cortisol is associated with increased caloric intake and greater abdominal fat storage [56]. The health behavior pathway may not be independent from that of stress but rather reflect a serial mediation model, wherein weight stigma increases stress that in turn causes decrements in health behaviors.
The present study contributes to the weight stigma literature in several ways. As noted, a key strength of this study is the assessment of several health behaviors within a large, national census-matched sample. Previous studies that have examined weight stigma in relation to different health behaviors have often had small sample sizes or were limited to female subjects. Thus, the present study may provide more generalizable information about health behaviors in the U.S. A related strength of the study is that higher BMI scores were well-represented in the sample, with 31.4% meeting BMI criteria for obesity. This is a closer estimate of the proportion of the American population that is classified with obesity (42%) compared to previous studies [57]. Therefore, there is greater confidence that these findings reflect the experiences of individuals with obesity in the population, aiding generalizability. Lastly, we enhance reproducibility by presenting a two-stage research program of exploratory and confirmatory analyses based on recommended open science practices.
There are some limitations to consider. First, a composite weight stigma score was used due to survey constraints. While early tests indicate good construct validity, additional psychometric testing is warranted (see Online Supplementary Materials 4). Another limitation is the use of self-reported weight, which is subject to inaccuracies. Additionally, the data collection period overlapped with winter holidays. Individuals may have made new years health resolutions, and therefore the self-reported health behaviors may be more indicative of newly established goals rather than typical health habits. However, such resolutions would likely dampen, rather than magnify, the relationship between weight stigma and poor health behaviors. Lastly, the study is cross-sectional and therefore causal direction cannot be determined. Weight stigma may operate as a feedback loop that leads to weight gain through certain behaviors such as comfort eating [6], but further investigation is required. Given survey constraints, weight bias internalization was not assessed. Future research should build on these findings to determine the potential role of weight bias internalization in these health behaviors.
Despite these limitations, these studys findings show that weight stigma is significantly associated with several health behaviors. If future research confirms that this is indeed a causal relationship, weight stigma could cumulatively undermine physical health over time. Taken together, these findings highlight weight stigma as a potential barrier to healthy behaviors, and suggest that one strategy to improve population health may be to reduce weight stigma. Though more research is needed, it may be important to employ more weight-inclusive approaches to health promotion, such as removing stigmatizing language or weight outcomes from health policies and program objectives [5].","Think about why this might be relevant for the audience in the grand scheme of things.

The study found that weight stigma may undermine an individual's ability to improve their health, regardless of their BMI. While weight stigma has been known to have a negative impact on physical health, this study sheds light on the impact it can have on health behaviors, which could accumulate over time. The findings suggest that reducing weight stigma may be an important strategy for improving population health."
