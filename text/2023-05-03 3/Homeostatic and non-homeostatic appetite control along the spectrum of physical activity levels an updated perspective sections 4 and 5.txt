Homeostatic and non-homeostatic appetite control along the spectrum of physical activity levels an updated perspective

201 4. Energy intake and appetite control along the spectrum of physical activity levels 
202 While there is evidence for the negative feedback mechanisms involved in satiation 
203 and satiety based on the interaction between tonic adiposity and episodic gut signals, less is 
204 known on the factors that drive hunger and food intake. Whether EE and PA are drivers of EI
205 has not been well understood [58]. The relationship between EE, PA and EI in humans was 
206 examined over 50 years ago [59-61]. Mayer et al. demonstrated a relationship between 
207 occupational PA and daily EI in Bengali jute mill workers whose daily occupations ranged from 
208 “sedentary” to “very heavy work” whereby those performing very heavy work consumed more 
209 than those performing light work [61]. In line with Mayer, Edholm et al. [60] found a strong 
210 relationship between TDEE and daily EI in army cadets over three weeks. Despite providing 
211 initial evidence for physiological processes and behavioural activities impacting on appetite 
212 and providing a demand for food intake, this concept was left dormant for several decades. 
213 The roles of body composition and EE in driving food intake have recently been re214 examined and have gathered attention within the scientific community [62, 63]. Fat-free mass 
215 has been found to be strongly positively associated with EI in lean and overweight/obese 
216 individuals [64, 65], corroborating findings from earlier but less known studies [66, 67]. In 
10
217 contrast, an inverse relationship between fat mass and EI, and hunger and EI was found in 
218 lean but these associations were weaker and less consistent in overweight and obese 
219 individuals [64, 66-68]. These findings are in line with the proposition that negative feedback 
220 signals reflecting energy stores inhibiting food intake are blunted with higher body fat [14, 31]. 
221 In addition to fat-free mass, RMR has also been shown to predict EI and hunger [1], which led 
222 to the suggestion that RMR (largely determined by fat-free mass) exerts a tonic day-to-day 
223 signal for hunger and the drive to eat [69]. It has recently been shown that the associations 
224 between fat-free mass and EI are mediated by RMR [3] and TDEE [70], suggesting that the
225 associations between fat-free mass and EI reflect the energetic demands of metabolically 
226 active tissue. 
227 In the 70 individuals from Figure 1, we found that both fat-free mass and fat mass were 
228 significantly positively and inversely associated with meal size, respectively, corroborating 
229 prior studies in lean individuals [62, 66]. Interestingly, exploratory analyses suggested that the 
230 strength of the association between fat mass and meal size may be moderated by PA level as 
231 the association was strongest in those with the highest time spent in moderate-to-vigorous PA 
232 (MVPA) when divided by sex-stratified tertiles (Figure 2) [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. 
233 However, the mechanisms responsible for this effect are unknown and whether these stem 
234 from a direct effect of PA on fat mass or indirectly though other physiological, behavioural or 
235 psychological factors remains to be elucidated.

242 The contribution of PA per se towards the drive to eat is less apparent. In comparison 
243 to RMR, PAEE makes up a smaller portion of TDEE and is more variable; therefore, its impact 
244 on EI may be harder to quantify. However, it can be proposed that PAEE (behavioural EE) will 
245 be a determinant of EI just like RMR (but weaker overall and with great individual variability –
246 see Figure 1). Recently, a systematic review and a meta-analysis concluded that there is little 
247 evidence that PA or exercise, whether acute or chronic, leads to changes in EI [71, 72]. 
248 However, the acute or relatively short-term nature of these studies may not have been long 
249 enough to demonstrate a compensatory rise in EI with habitual PA [73] and as originally 
250 demonstrated by Mayer et al. [61]. Indeed, a strong relationship was found between 
12
251 objectively-measured PA (activity counts) and EI (food records) in 300 middle-aged women 
252 [74]. It is important to note that the study by Mayer et al. revealed two separate effects of 
253 habitual PA level on EI, characterised by a J-shape relationship. In the jute mill workers with 
254 higher levels of occupational PA (e.g. “medium” to “very heavy” work), daily EE and EI were 
255 closely matched, but at low levels of occupational PA where body mass was also greater, this 
256 coupling was lost, such that daily EI exceeded EE in those performing “sedentary” to “light”
257 work [61]. 
258
259 4.1 The zones of appetite control 
260 Based on the study by Mayer et al. [61], Blundell proposed that appetite control is 
261 enhanced with increasing levels of PA [75]. In contrast, physical inactivity could not only 
262 reduce TDEE but also lead to appetite dysregulation, overconsumption and eventually weight 
263 gain [75]. Indeed, according to Jacobs [76], “the late Henry L Taylor favoured a model that 
264 linked EI to EE in a J-shaped curve (personal communication, late 1970s). The first part of his 
265 concept was that EI is in exact homeostasis with EE under conditions of high EE. The second 
266 part was that there is a failure of homeostasis in a sedentary lifestyle because of its 
267 accompanying low EE. He postulated that body signals go awry in sedentary lifestyles; when 
268 a person does no physical work, the body will not recognize that it is being overfed. Sedentary 
269 persons may lose the innate ability to compensate for inactivity by reducing their eating” 
270 (p.189). It is important to note here that “sedentary” lifestyles used by this author should in fact 
271 be interpreted as inactive lifestyle in light of current definitions. Thus, Blundell revisited the 
272 Mayer J-shaped curve and suggested that individuals with low levels of PA could be 
273 considered as being within a “non-regulated zone” of appetite control, whereas those with
274 higher levels of PA could be within a “regulated zone” of appetite control [75]. 
275 While this model of appetite control and EI along the spectrum of PA levels was 
276 originally based on limited evidence, it has recently been supported [7, 77]. In a systematic 
13
277 review using data from 10 cross-sectional studies that compared EI in active and inactive 
278 individuals, we plotted standardized EI (z-scores) according to four PA levels ranging from low 
279 to very high. This analysis revealed a clear J-shape relationship between PA level and EI [7]. 
280 Similarly, Shook et al. estimated EI based on changes in body composition across quintiles of 
281 PA in a large sample of young adults and again demonstrated appetite dysregulation in those 
282 with the lowest PA [77]. 
283
284 5. The impact of physical activity and exercise on the mechanisms of appetite control 
285 Emerging studies are shedding light on the mechanisms contributing to the proposed 
286 dysregulation of appetite at lower levels of PA and more sensitive appetite control at higher 
287 levels of PA. These mechanisms may not necessarily be the same along the whole spectrum 
288 of PA levels. Acutely, exercise has been shown to influence gastric emptying [78], attenuate 
289 the release of ghrelin and increase the secretion of PYY, GLP-1 and pancreatic polypeptide 
290 [79]. Chronic exercise may increase the postprandial secretion of GLP-1 and PYY [80]. 
291 Therefore, habitual PA (and exercise) may interact with food intake to enhance hormonal 
292 satiety signalling [81]. Moreover, regular PA and exercise training are associated with several 
293 other physiological adaptations such as improved sensitivity to insulin [82] and leptin [83, 84], 
294 substrate metabolism [85], and body composition [86], which have been proposed as 
295 mechanisms involved in food intake and eating behaviour [87, 88]. Evidence suggests that PA 
296 influences appetite control through a dual-process action which increases the drive to eat but 
297 also post-meal satiety [89]. Several studies have now demonstrated that physically active 
298 individuals show better energy compensation than their less active counterparts following 
299 consumption of preloads differing in energy content such that they reduce EI to offset the 
300 difference in energy consumed from the preloads [10, 90-94]. This preload-test meal paradigm 
301 is effective in measuring the strength of satiety [95]. These improvements in satiety may be 
302 associated with exercise-induced adaptations in episodic satiety signalling [80, 91, 96] or
303 gastric emptying [97]. In contrast, we have shown that satiation does not appear to be 
14
304 influenced by PA level in non-obese individuals when measured with a passive 
305 overconsumption paradigm comparing ad libitum EI at meals high in fat or carbohydrate [9]. 
306 However, in overweight and obese individuals, Caudwell et al. [1] showed that exercise 
307 training led to a reduction in EI at a high-fat/energy dense test meal. This may be associated 
308 with enhanced satiation, but given the homeostatic and non-homeostatic determinants of food 
309 intake, may also reflect changes in food hedonics or behavioural traits. 
310 While there is strong support that habitual PA affects homeostatic mechanisms 
311 controlling food intake, less is known on its effect on non-homeostatic processes, and their 
312 contribution to appetite control along the spectrum of PA levels. Indeed, secondary analyses 
313 from the study from Caudwell et al. [1] revealed a reduction in hedonic wanting for high-fat 
314 foods relative to low-fat foods (Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire), disinhibition and binge 
315 eating following exercise training [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. Furthermore, another 
316 study from our group found inverse associations between time spent in MVPA and disinhibition 
317 and binge eating, but these did not remain significant after controlling for body fat [24]. This 
318 corroborates a study by Shook et al. who found greater disinhibition in their lowest quintile of 
319 MVPA but not when controlling for body weight [77], and the aforementioned reduction in 
320 disinhibition and binge eating score following 12 weeks of exercise training which did not 
321 remain significant after controlling for change in body fat [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. 
322 These differences in disinhibition and binge eating were not apparent in non-obese individuals 
323 varying in PA levels [9, 10], suggesting the influence of habitual PA on eating behaviour traits 
324 may be more strongly influenced by body composition. In terms of food hedonics, differences 
325 in the rewarding value of foods (liking and wanting) have been observed in lean active 
326 compared to overweight inactive males [98], but in non-obese individuals, PA level did not 
327 influence liking and wanting for high-fat food in the hungry or fed states [9, 10]. In inactive 
328 individuals with overweight and obesity, 12 weeks of exercise training (125-250 kcal per 
329 exercise session) did not affect liking or wanting [99], whereas another 12-week intervention 
330 at a higher dose of exercise (500 kcal per exercise session) reduced the hedonic wanting for 
15
331 high-fat food independent of changes in body fat [Beaulieu et al. unpublished results]. 
332 Moreover, habitual (self-reported) PA may differently impact food cravings depending on 
333 exercise type and sex [100]. These studies suggest there may be differing effects of PA on
334 non-homeostatic appetite control according to an individual’s body fat status, sex, and dose 
335 and type of PA. 
336 Therefore, we can propose that in addition to individuals with non-regulated appetite 
337 having blunted satiety signalling, excess body fat in these individuals may amplify non338 homeostatic inputs favouring overconsumption. In contrast, individuals with regulated appetite 
339 with higher levels of PA have enhanced postprandial sensitivity, allowing for EI to be better 
340 matched to EE in response to hunger and satiety signals. This is demonstrated in an updated 
341 perspective of the zones of appetite control in Figure 3.
