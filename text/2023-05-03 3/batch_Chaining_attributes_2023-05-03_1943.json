Energy intake and appetite control along the spectrum of physical activity levels \n202 While there is evidence for the negative feedback mechanisms involved in satiation \n203 and satiety based on the interaction between tonic adiposity and episodic gut signals, less is \n204 known on the factors that drive hunger and food intake. Whether EE and PA are drivers of EI\n205 has not been well understood [58]. The relationship between EE, PA and EI in humans was \n206 examined over 50 years ago [59-61]. Mayer et al. demonstrated a relationship between \n207 occupational PA and daily EI in Bengali jute mill workers whose daily occupations ranged from \n208 \u0093sedentary\u0094 to \u0093very heavy work\u0094 whereby those performing very heavy work consumed more \n209 than those performing light work [61]. In line with Mayer, Edholm et al. [60] found a strong \n210 relationship between TDEE and daily EI in army cadets over three weeks. Despite providing \n211 initial evidence for physiological processes and behavioural activities impacting on appetite \n212 and providing a demand for food intake, this concept was left dormant for several decades. \n213 The roles of body composition and EE in driving food intake have recently been re214 examined and have gathered attention within the scientific community [62, 63]. Fat-free mass \n215 has been found to be strongly positively associated with EI in lean and overweight/obese \n216 individuals [64, 65], corroborating findings from earlier but less known studies [66, 67]. In \n10\n217 contrast, an inverse relationship between fat mass and EI, and hunger and EI was found in \n218 lean but these associations were weaker and less consistent in overweight and obese \n219 individuals [64, 66-68]. These findings are in line with the proposition that negative feedback \n220 signals reflecting energy stores inhibiting food intake are blunted with higher body fat [14, 31]. \n221 In addition to fat-free mass, RMR has also been shown to predict EI and hunger [1], which led \n222 to the suggestion that RMR (largely determined by fat-free mass) exerts a tonic day-to-day \n223 signal for hunger and the drive to eat [69]. It has recently been shown that the associations \n224 between fat-free mass and EI are mediated by RMR [3] and TDEE [70], suggesting that the\n225 associations between fat-free mass and EI reflect the energetic demands of metabolically \n226 active tissue. \n227 In the 70 individuals from Figure 1, we found that both fat-free mass and fat mass were \n228 significantly positively and inversely associated with meal size, respectively, corroborating \n229 prior studies in lean individuals [62, 66]. Interestingly, exploratory analyses suggested that the \n230 strength of the association between fat mass and meal size may be moderated by PA level as \n231 the association was strongest in those with the highest time spent in moderate-to-vigorous PA \n232 (MVPA) when divided by sex-stratified tertiles (Figure 2) [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. \n233 However, the mechanisms responsible for this effect are unknown and whether these stem \n234 from a direct effect of PA on fat mass or indirectly though other physiological, behavioural or \n235 psychological factors remains to be elucidated.\n\n242 The contribution of PA per se towards the drive to eat is less apparent. In comparison \n243 to RMR, PAEE makes up a smaller portion of TDEE and is more variable; therefore, its impact \n244 on EI may be harder to quantify. However, it can be proposed that PAEE (behavioural EE) will \n245 be a determinant of EI just like RMR (but weaker overall and with great individual variability \u0096\n246 see Figure 1). Recently, a systematic review and a meta-analysis concluded that there is little \n247 evidence that PA or exercise, whether acute or chronic, leads to changes in EI [71, 72]. \n248 However, the acute or relatively short-term nature of these studies may not have been long \n249 enough to demonstrate a compensatory rise in EI with habitual PA [73] and as originally \n250 demonstrated by Mayer et al. [61]. Indeed, a strong relationship was found between \n12\n251 objectively-measured PA (activity counts) and EI (food records) in 300 middle-aged women \n252 [74]. It is important to note that the study by Mayer et al. revealed two separate effects of \n253 habitual PA level on EI, characterised by a J-shape relationship. In the jute mill workers with \n254 higher levels of occupational PA (e.g. \u0093medium\u0094 to \u0093very heavy\u0094 work), daily EE and EI were \n255 closely matched, but at low levels of occupational PA where body mass was also greater, this \n256 coupling was lost, such that daily EI exceeded EE in those performing \u0093sedentary\u0094 to \u0093light\u0094\n257 work [61]. \n258\n259 4.1 The zones of appetite control \n260 Based on the study by Mayer et al. [61], Blundell proposed that appetite control is \n261 enhanced with increasing levels of PA [75]. In contrast, physical inactivity could not only \n262 reduce TDEE but also lead to appetite dysregulation, overconsumption and eventually weight \n263 gain [75]. Indeed, according to Jacobs [76], \u0093the late Henry L Taylor favoured a model that \n264 linked EI to EE in a J-shaped curve (personal communication, late 1970s). The first part of his \n265 concept was that EI is in exact homeostasis with EE under conditions of high EE. The second \n266 part was that there is a failure of homeostasis in a sedentary lifestyle because of its \n267 accompanying low EE. He postulated that body signals go awry in sedentary lifestyles; when \n268 a person does no physical work, the body will not recognize that it is being overfed. Sedentary \n269 persons may lose the innate ability to compensate for inactivity by reducing their eating\u0094 \n270 (p.189). It is important to note here that \u0093sedentary\u0094 lifestyles used by this author should in fact \n271 be interpreted as inactive lifestyle in light of current definitions. Thus, Blundell revisited the \n272 Mayer J-shaped curve and suggested that individuals with low levels of PA could be \n273 considered as being within a \u0093non-regulated zone\u0094 of appetite control, whereas those with\n274 higher levels of PA could be within a \u0093regulated zone\u0094 of appetite control [75]. \n275 While this model of appetite control and EI along the spectrum of PA levels was \n276 originally based on limited evidence, it has recently been supported [7, 77]. In a systematic \n13\n277 review using data from 10 cross-sectional studies that compared EI in active and inactive \n278 individuals, we plotted standardized EI (z-scores) according to four PA levels ranging from low \n279 to very high. This analysis revealed a clear J-shape relationship between PA level and EI [7]. \n280 Similarly, Shook et al. estimated EI based on changes in body composition across quintiles of \n281 PA in a large sample of young adults and again demonstrated appetite dysregulation in those \n282 with the lowest PA [77]. \n283\n284 5. The impact of physical activity and exercise on the mechanisms of appetite control \n285 Emerging studies are shedding light on the mechanisms contributing to the proposed \n286 dysregulation of appetite at lower levels of PA and more sensitive appetite control at higher \n287 levels of PA. These mechanisms may not necessarily be the same along the whole spectrum \n288 of PA levels. Acutely, exercise has been shown to influence gastric emptying [78], attenuate \n289 the release of ghrelin and increase the secretion of PYY, GLP-1 and pancreatic polypeptide \n290 [79]. Chronic exercise may increase the postprandial secretion of GLP-1 and PYY [80]. \n291 Therefore, habitual PA (and exercise) may interact with food intake to enhance hormonal \n292 satiety signalling [81]. Moreover, regular PA and exercise training are associated with several \n293 other physiological adaptations such as improved sensitivity to insulin [82] and leptin [83, 84], \n294 substrate metabolism [85], and body composition [86], which have been proposed as \n295 mechanisms involved in food intake and eating behaviour [87, 88]. Evidence suggests that PA \n296 influences appetite control through a dual-process action which increases the drive to eat but \n297 also post-meal satiety [89]. Several studies have now demonstrated that physically active \n298 individuals show better energy compensation than their less active counterparts following \n299 consumption of preloads differing in energy content such that they reduce EI to offset the \n300 difference in energy consumed from the preloads [10, 90-94]. This preload-test meal paradigm \n301 is effective in measuring the strength of satiety [95]. These improvements in satiety may be \n302 associated with exercise-induced adaptations in episodic satiety signalling [80, 91, 96] or\n303 gastric emptying [97]. In contrast, we have shown that satiation does not appear to be \n14\n304 influenced by PA level in non-obese individuals when measured with a passive \n305 overconsumption paradigm comparing ad libitum EI at meals high in fat or carbohydrate [9]. \n306 However, in overweight and obese individuals, Caudwell et al. [1] showed that exercise \n307 training led to a reduction in EI at a high-fat/energy dense test meal. This may be associated \n308 with enhanced satiation, but given the homeostatic and non-homeostatic determinants of food \n309 intake, may also reflect changes in food hedonics or behavioural traits. \n310 While there is strong support that habitual PA affects homeostatic mechanisms \n311 controlling food intake, less is known on its effect on non-homeostatic processes, and their \n312 contribution to appetite control along the spectrum of PA levels. Indeed, secondary analyses \n313 from the study from Caudwell et al. [1] revealed a reduction in hedonic wanting for high-fat \n314 foods relative to low-fat foods (Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire), disinhibition and binge \n315 eating following exercise training [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. Furthermore, another \n316 study from our group found inverse associations between time spent in MVPA and disinhibition \n317 and binge eating, but these did not remain significant after controlling for body fat [24]. This \n318 corroborates a study by Shook et al. who found greater disinhibition in their lowest quintile of \n319 MVPA but not when controlling for body weight [77], and the aforementioned reduction in \n320 disinhibition and binge eating score following 12 weeks of exercise training which did not \n321 remain significant after controlling for change in body fat [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. \n322 These differences in disinhibition and binge eating were not apparent in non-obese individuals \n323 varying in PA levels [9, 10], suggesting the influence of habitual PA on eating behaviour traits \n324 may be more strongly influenced by body composition. In terms of food hedonics, differences \n325 in the rewarding value of foods (liking and wanting) have been observed in lean active \n326 compared to overweight inactive males [98], but in non-obese individuals, PA level did not \n327 influence liking and wanting for high-fat food in the hungry or fed states [9, 10]. In inactive \n328 individuals with overweight and obesity, 12 weeks of exercise training (125-250 kcal per \n329 exercise session) did not affect liking or wanting [99], whereas another 12-week intervention \n330 at a higher dose of exercise (500 kcal per exercise session) reduced the hedonic wanting for \n15\n331 high-fat food independent of changes in body fat [Beaulieu et al. unpublished results]. \n332 Moreover, habitual (self-reported) PA may differently impact food cravings depending on \n333 exercise type and sex [100]. These studies suggest there may be differing effects of PA on\n334 non-homeostatic appetite control according to an individual\u0092s body fat status, sex, and dose \n335 and type of PA. \n336 Therefore, we can propose that in addition to individuals with non-regulated appetite \n337 having blunted satiety signalling, excess body fat in these individuals may amplify non338 homeostatic inputs favouring overconsumption. In contrast, individuals with regulated appetite \n339 with higher levels of PA have enhanced postprandial sensitivity, allowing for EI to be better \n340 matched to EE in response to hunger and satiety signals. This is demonstrated in an updated \n341 perspective of the zones of appetite control in Figure 3.\n\n", "system_role": "You are an expert at science communication.", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 1000, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "qna": {"article_title": "Homeostatic and non-homeostatic appetite control along the spectrum of physical activity levels an updated perspective", "system_role": "You are an expert at science communication.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "text": "Homeostatic and non-homeostatic appetite control along the spectrum of physical activity levels an updated perspective\n\n201 4.

In \n10\n217 contrast, an inverse relationship between fat mass and EI, and hunger and EI was found in \n218 lean but these associations were weaker and less consistent in overweight and obese \n219 individuals [64, 66-68].

[61], Blundell proposed that appetite control is \n261 enhanced with increasing levels of PA [75]. In contrast, physical inactivity could not only \n262 reduce TDEE but also lead to appetite dysregulation, overconsumption and eventually weight \n263 gain [75]. Indeed, according to Jacobs [76], \u0093the late Henry L Taylor favoured a model that \n264 linked EI to EE in a J-shaped curve (personal communication, late 1970s). The first part of his \n265 concept was that EI is in exact homeostasis with EE under conditions of high EE.

He postulated that body signals go awry in sedentary lifestyles; when \n268 a person does no physical work, the body will not recognize that it is being overfed. Sedentary \n269 persons may lose the innate ability to compensate for inactivity by reducing their eating\u0094 \n270 (p.189). It is important to note here that \u0093sedentary\u0094 lifestyles used by this author should in fact \n271 be interpreted as inactive lifestyle in light of current definitions. Thus, Blundell revisited the \n272 Mayer J-shaped curve and suggested that individuals with low levels of PA could be \n273 considered as being within a \u0093non-regulated zone\u0094 of appetite control, whereas those with\n274 higher levels of PA could be within a \u0093regulated zone\u0094 of appetite control [75]. \n275 While this model of appetite control and EI along the spectrum of PA levels was \n276 originally based on limited evidence, it has recently been supported [7, 77]. In a systematic \n13\n277 review using data from 10 cross-sectional studies that compared EI in active and inactive \n278 individuals, we plotted standardized EI (z-scores) according to four PA levels ranging from low \n279 to very high.

The impact of physical activity and exercise on the mechanisms of appetite control \n285 Emerging studies are shedding light on the mechanisms contributing to the proposed \n286 dysregulation of appetite at lower levels of PA and more sensitive appetite control at higher \n287 levels of PA. These mechanisms may not necessarily be the same along the whole spectrum \n288 of PA levels. Acutely, exercise has been shown to influence gastric emptying [78], attenuate \n289 the release of ghrelin and increase the secretion of PYY, GLP-1 and pancreatic polypeptide \n290 [79]. Chronic exercise may increase the postprandial secretion of GLP-1 and PYY [80]. \n291 Therefore, habitual PA (and exercise) may interact with food intake to enhance hormonal \n292 satiety signalling [81]. Moreover, regular PA and exercise training are associated with several \n293 other physiological adaptations such as improved sensitivity to insulin [82] and leptin [83, 84], \n294 substrate metabolism [85], and body composition [86], which have been proposed as \n295 mechanisms involved in food intake and eating behaviour [87, 88]. Evidence suggests that PA \n296 influences appetite control through a dual-process action which increases the drive to eat but \n297 also post-meal satiety [89]. Several studies have now demonstrated that physically active \n298 individuals show better energy compensation than their less active counterparts following \n299 consumption of preloads differing in energy content such that they reduce EI to offset the \n300 difference in energy consumed from the preloads [10, 90-94]. This preload-test meal paradigm \n301 is effective in measuring the strength of satiety [95]. These improvements in satiety may be \n302 associated with exercise-induced adaptations in episodic satiety signalling [80, 91, 96] or\n303 gastric emptying [97]. In contrast, we have shown that satiation does not appear to be \n14\n304 influenced by PA level in non-obese individuals when measured with a passive \n305 overconsumption paradigm comparing ad libitum EI at meals high in fat or carbohydrate [9]. \n306 However, in overweight and obese individuals, Caudwell et al. [1] showed that exercise \n307 training led to a reduction in EI at a high-fat/energy dense test meal. This may be associated \n308 with enhanced satiation, but given the homeostatic and non-homeostatic determinants of food \n309 intake, may also reflect changes in food hedonics or behavioural traits. \n310 While there is strong support that habitual PA affects homeostatic mechanisms \n311 controlling food intake, less is known on its effect on non-homeostatic processes, and their \n312 contribution to appetite control along the spectrum of PA levels. Indeed, secondary analyses \n313 from the study from Caudwell et al. [1] revealed a reduction in hedonic wanting for high-fat \n314 foods relative to low-fat foods (Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire), disinhibition and binge \n315 eating following exercise training [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. Furthermore, another \n316 study from our group found inverse associations between time spent in MVPA and disinhibition \n317 and binge eating, but these did not remain significant after controlling for body fat [24]. This \n318 corroborates a study by Shook et al. who found greater disinhibition in their lowest quintile of \n319 MVPA but not when controlling for body weight [77], and the aforementioned reduction in \n320 disinhibition and binge eating score following 12 weeks of exercise training which did not \n321 remain significant after controlling for change in body fat [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. \n322 These differences in disinhibition and binge eating were not apparent in non-obese individuals \n323 varying in PA levels [9, 10], suggesting the influence of habitual PA on eating behaviour traits \n324 may be more strongly influenced by body composition. In terms of food hedonics, differences \n325 in the rewarding value of foods (liking and wanting) have been observed in lean active \n326 compared to overweight inactive males [98], but in non-obese individuals, PA level did not \n327 influence liking and wanting for high-fat food in the hungry or fed states [9, 10]. In inactive \n328 individuals with overweight and obesity, 12 weeks of exercise training (125-250 kcal per \n329 exercise session) did not affect liking or wanting [99], whereas another 12-week intervention \n330 at a higher dose of exercise (500 kcal per exercise session) reduced the hedonic wanting for \n15\n331 high-fat food independent of changes in body fat [Beaulieu et al. unpublished results]. \n332 Moreover, habitual (self-reported) PA may differently impact food cravings depending on \n333 exercise type and sex [100]. These studies suggest there may be differing effects of PA on\n334 non-homeostatic appetite control according to an individual\u0092s body fat status, sex, and dose \n335 and type of PA. \n336 Therefore, we can propose that in addition to individuals with non-regulated appetite \n337 having blunted satiety signalling, excess body fat in these individuals may amplify non338 homeostatic inputs favouring overconsumption. In contrast, individuals with regulated appetite \n339 with higher levels of PA have enhanced postprandial sensitivity, allowing for EI to be better \n340 matched to EE in response to hunger and satiety signals. This is demonstrated in an updated \n341 perspective of the zones of appetite control in Figure 3.\n\n", "prep step": "Take the key points and numerical descriptors to", "summarization task": "Describe the interesting points to your coworker at the water cooler", "full summarization task": "Take the key points and numerical descriptors to Describe the interesting points to your coworker at the water cooler", "summary": ["Hey!

Energy intake and appetite control along the spectrum of physical activity levels \n202 While there is evidence for the negative feedback mechanisms involved in satiation \n203 and satiety based on the interaction between tonic adiposity and episodic gut signals, less is \n204 known on the factors that drive hunger and food intake. Whether EE and PA are drivers of EI\n205 has not been well understood [58]. The relationship between EE, PA and EI in humans was \n206 examined over 50 years ago [59-61]. Mayer et al. demonstrated a relationship between \n207 occupational PA and daily EI in Bengali jute mill workers whose daily occupations ranged from \n208 \u0093sedentary\u0094 to \u0093very heavy work\u0094 whereby those performing very heavy work consumed more \n209 than those performing light work [61]. In line with Mayer, Edholm et al. [60] found a strong \n210 relationship between TDEE and daily EI in army cadets over three weeks. Despite providing \n211 initial evidence for physiological processes and behavioural activities impacting on appetite \n212 and providing a demand for food intake, this concept was left dormant for several decades. \n213 The roles of body composition and EE in driving food intake have recently been re214 examined and have gathered attention within the scientific community [62, 63]. Fat-free mass \n215 has been found to be strongly positively associated with EI in lean and overweight/obese \n216 individuals [64, 65], corroborating findings from earlier but less known studies [66, 67]. In \n10\n217 contrast, an inverse relationship between fat mass and EI, and hunger and EI was found in \n218 lean but these associations were weaker and less consistent in overweight and obese \n219 individuals [64, 66-68]. These findings are in line with the proposition that negative feedback \n220 signals reflecting energy stores inhibiting food intake are blunted with higher body fat [14, 31]. \n221 In addition to fat-free mass, RMR has also been shown to predict EI and hunger [1], which led \n222 to the suggestion that RMR (largely determined by fat-free mass) exerts a tonic day-to-day \n223 signal for hunger and the drive to eat [69]. It has recently been shown that the associations \n224 between fat-free mass and EI are mediated by RMR [3] and TDEE [70], suggesting that the\n225 associations between fat-free mass and EI reflect the energetic demands of metabolically \n226 active tissue. \n227 In the 70 individuals from Figure 1, we found that both fat-free mass and fat mass were \n228 significantly positively and inversely associated with meal size, respectively, corroborating \n229 prior studies in lean individuals [62, 66]. Interestingly, exploratory analyses suggested that the \n230 strength of the association between fat mass and meal size may be moderated by PA level as \n231 the association was strongest in those with the highest time spent in moderate-to-vigorous PA \n232 (MVPA) when divided by sex-stratified tertiles (Figure 2) [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. \n233 However, the mechanisms responsible for this effect are unknown and whether these stem \n234 from a direct effect of PA on fat mass or indirectly though other physiological, behavioural or \n235 psychological factors remains to be elucidated.\n\n242 The contribution of PA per se towards the drive to eat is less apparent. In comparison \n243 to RMR, PAEE makes up a smaller portion of TDEE and is more variable; therefore, its impact \n244 on EI may be harder to quantify. However, it can be proposed that PAEE (behavioural EE) will \n245 be a determinant of EI just like RMR (but weaker overall and with great individual variability \u0096\n246 see Figure 1). Recently, a systematic review and a meta-analysis concluded that there is little \n247 evidence that PA or exercise, whether acute or chronic, leads to changes in EI [71, 72]. \n248 However, the acute or relatively short-term nature of these studies may not have been long \n249 enough to demonstrate a compensatory rise in EI with habitual PA [73] and as originally \n250 demonstrated by Mayer et al. [61]. Indeed, a strong relationship was found between \n12\n251 objectively-measured PA (activity counts) and EI (food records) in 300 middle-aged women \n252 [74]. It is important to note that the study by Mayer et al. revealed two separate effects of \n253 habitual PA level on EI, characterised by a J-shape relationship. In the jute mill workers with \n254 higher levels of occupational PA (e.g. \u0093medium\u0094 to \u0093very heavy\u0094 work), daily EE and EI were \n255 closely matched, but at low levels of occupational PA where body mass was also greater, this \n256 coupling was lost, such that daily EI exceeded EE in those performing \u0093sedentary\u0094 to \u0093light\u0094\n257 work [61]. \n258\n259 4.1 The zones of appetite control \n260 Based on the study by Mayer et al. [61], Blundell proposed that appetite control is \n261 enhanced with increasing levels of PA [75]. In contrast, physical inactivity could not only \n262 reduce TDEE but also lead to appetite dysregulation, overconsumption and eventually weight \n263 gain [75]. Indeed, according to Jacobs [76], \u0093the late Henry L Taylor favoured a model that \n264 linked EI to EE in a J-shaped curve (personal communication, late 1970s). The first part of his \n265 concept was that EI is in exact homeostasis with EE under conditions of high EE. The second \n266 part was that there is a failure of homeostasis in a sedentary lifestyle because of its \n267 accompanying low EE. He postulated that body signals go awry in sedentary lifestyles; when \n268 a person does no physical work, the body will not recognize that it is being overfed. Sedentary \n269 persons may lose the innate ability to compensate for inactivity by reducing their eating\u0094 \n270 (p.189). It is important to note here that \u0093sedentary\u0094 lifestyles used by this author should in fact \n271 be interpreted as inactive lifestyle in light of current definitions. Thus, Blundell revisited the \n272 Mayer J-shaped curve and suggested that individuals with low levels of PA could be \n273 considered as being within a \u0093non-regulated zone\u0094 of appetite control, whereas those with\n274 higher levels of PA could be within a \u0093regulated zone\u0094 of appetite control [75]. \n275 While this model of appetite control and EI along the spectrum of PA levels was \n276 originally based on limited evidence, it has recently been supported [7, 77]. In a systematic \n13\n277 review using data from 10 cross-sectional studies that compared EI in active and inactive \n278 individuals, we plotted standardized EI (z-scores) according to four PA levels ranging from low \n279 to very high. This analysis revealed a clear J-shape relationship between PA level and EI [7]. \n280 Similarly, Shook et al. estimated EI based on changes in body composition across quintiles of \n281 PA in a large sample of young adults and again demonstrated appetite dysregulation in those \n282 with the lowest PA [77]. \n283\n284 5. The impact of physical activity and exercise on the mechanisms of appetite control \n285 Emerging studies are shedding light on the mechanisms contributing to the proposed \n286 dysregulation of appetite at lower levels of PA and more sensitive appetite control at higher \n287 levels of PA. These mechanisms may not necessarily be the same along the whole spectrum \n288 of PA levels. Acutely, exercise has been shown to influence gastric emptying [78], attenuate \n289 the release of ghrelin and increase the secretion of PYY, GLP-1 and pancreatic polypeptide \n290 [79]. Chronic exercise may increase the postprandial secretion of GLP-1 and PYY [80]. \n291 Therefore, habitual PA (and exercise) may interact with food intake to enhance hormonal \n292 satiety signalling [81]. Moreover, regular PA and exercise training are associated with several \n293 other physiological adaptations such as improved sensitivity to insulin [82] and leptin [83, 84], \n294 substrate metabolism [85], and body composition [86], which have been proposed as \n295 mechanisms involved in food intake and eating behaviour [87, 88]. Evidence suggests that PA \n296 influences appetite control through a dual-process action which increases the drive to eat but \n297 also post-meal satiety [89]. Several studies have now demonstrated that physically active \n298 individuals show better energy compensation than their less active counterparts following \n299 consumption of preloads differing in energy content such that they reduce EI to offset the \n300 difference in energy consumed from the preloads [10, 90-94]. This preload-test meal paradigm \n301 is effective in measuring the strength of satiety [95]. These improvements in satiety may be \n302 associated with exercise-induced adaptations in episodic satiety signalling [80, 91, 96] or\n303 gastric emptying [97]. In contrast, we have shown that satiation does not appear to be \n14\n304 influenced by PA level in non-obese individuals when measured with a passive \n305 overconsumption paradigm comparing ad libitum EI at meals high in fat or carbohydrate [9]. \n306 However, in overweight and obese individuals, Caudwell et al. [1] showed that exercise \n307 training led to a reduction in EI at a high-fat/energy dense test meal. This may be associated \n308 with enhanced satiation, but given the homeostatic and non-homeostatic determinants of food \n309 intake, may also reflect changes in food hedonics or behavioural traits. \n310 While there is strong support that habitual PA affects homeostatic mechanisms \n311 controlling food intake, less is known on its effect on non-homeostatic processes, and their \n312 contribution to appetite control along the spectrum of PA levels. Indeed, secondary analyses \n313 from the study from Caudwell et al. [1] revealed a reduction in hedonic wanting for high-fat \n314 foods relative to low-fat foods (Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire), disinhibition and binge \n315 eating following exercise training [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. Furthermore, another \n316 study from our group found inverse associations between time spent in MVPA and disinhibition \n317 and binge eating, but these did not remain significant after controlling for body fat [24]. This \n318 corroborates a study by Shook et al. who found greater disinhibition in their lowest quintile of \n319 MVPA but not when controlling for body weight [77], and the aforementioned reduction in \n320 disinhibition and binge eating score following 12 weeks of exercise training which did not \n321 remain significant after controlling for change in body fat [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. \n322 These differences in disinhibition and binge eating were not apparent in non-obese individuals \n323 varying in PA levels [9, 10], suggesting the influence of habitual PA on eating behaviour traits \n324 may be more strongly influenced by body composition. In terms of food hedonics, differences \n325 in the rewarding value of foods (liking and wanting) have been observed in lean active \n326 compared to overweight inactive males [98], but in non-obese individuals, PA level did not \n327 influence liking and wanting for high-fat food in the hungry or fed states [9, 10]. In inactive \n328 individuals with overweight and obesity, 12 weeks of exercise training (125-250 kcal per \n329 exercise session) did not affect liking or wanting [99], whereas another 12-week intervention \n330 at a higher dose of exercise (500 kcal per exercise session) reduced the hedonic wanting for \n15\n331 high-fat food independent of changes in body fat [Beaulieu et al. unpublished results]. \n332 Moreover, habitual (self-reported) PA may differently impact food cravings depending on \n333 exercise type and sex [100]. These studies suggest there may be differing effects of PA on\n334 non-homeostatic appetite control according to an individual\u0092s body fat status, sex, and dose \n335 and type of PA. \n336 Therefore, we can propose that in addition to individuals with non-regulated appetite \n337 having blunted satiety signalling, excess body fat in these individuals may amplify non338 homeostatic inputs favouring overconsumption. In contrast, individuals with regulated appetite \n339 with higher levels of PA have enhanced postprandial sensitivity, allowing for EI to be better \n340 matched to EE in response to hunger and satiety signals. This is demonstrated in an updated \n341 perspective of the zones of appetite control in Figure 3.\n\n", "system_role": "You are an expert at science communication.", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 1000, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "qna": {"article_title": "Homeostatic and non-homeostatic appetite control along the spectrum of physical activity levels an updated perspective", "system_role": "You are an expert at science communication.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "text": "Homeostatic and non-homeostatic appetite control along the spectrum of physical activity levels an updated perspective\n\n201 4. Energy intake and appetite control along the spectrum of physical activity levels \n202 While there is evidence for the negative feedback mechanisms involved in satiation \n203 and satiety based on the interaction between tonic adiposity and episodic gut signals, less is \n204 known on the factors that drive hunger and food intake. Whether EE and PA are drivers of EI\n205 has not been well understood [58]. The relationship between EE, PA and EI in humans was \n206 examined over 50 years ago [59-61]. Mayer et al. demonstrated a relationship between \n207 occupational PA and daily EI in Bengali jute mill workers whose daily occupations ranged from \n208 \u0093sedentary\u0094 to \u0093very heavy work\u0094 whereby those performing very heavy work consumed more \n209 than those performing light work [61]. In line with Mayer, Edholm et al. [60] found a strong \n210 relationship between TDEE and daily EI in army cadets over three weeks. Despite providing \n211 initial evidence for physiological processes and behavioural activities impacting on appetite \n212 and providing a demand for food intake, this concept was left dormant for several decades. \n213 The roles of body composition and EE in driving food intake have recently been re214 examined and have gathered attention within the scientific community [62, 63]. Fat-free mass \n215 has been found to be strongly positively associated with EI in lean and overweight/obese \n216 individuals [64, 65], corroborating findings from earlier but less known studies [66, 67]. In \n10\n217 contrast, an inverse relationship between fat mass and EI, and hunger and EI was found in \n218 lean but these associations were weaker and less consistent in overweight and obese \n219 individuals [64, 66-68]. These findings are in line with the proposition that negative feedback \n220 signals reflecting energy stores inhibiting food intake are blunted with higher body fat [14, 31]. \n221 In addition to fat-free mass, RMR has also been shown to predict EI and hunger [1], which led \n222 to the suggestion that RMR (largely determined by fat-free mass) exerts a tonic day-to-day \n223 signal for hunger and the drive to eat [69]. It has recently been shown that the associations \n224 between fat-free mass and EI are mediated by RMR [3] and TDEE [70], suggesting that the\n225 associations between fat-free mass and EI reflect the energetic demands of metabolically \n226 active tissue. \n227 In the 70 individuals from Figure 1, we found that both fat-free mass and fat mass were \n228 significantly positively and inversely associated with meal size, respectively, corroborating \n229 prior studies in lean individuals [62, 66]. Interestingly, exploratory analyses suggested that the \n230 strength of the association between fat mass and meal size may be moderated by PA level as \n231 the association was strongest in those with the highest time spent in moderate-to-vigorous PA \n232 (MVPA) when divided by sex-stratified tertiles (Figure 2) [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. \n233 However, the mechanisms responsible for this effect are unknown and whether these stem \n234 from a direct effect of PA on fat mass or indirectly though other physiological, behavioural or \n235 psychological factors remains to be elucidated.\n\n242 The contribution of PA per se towards the drive to eat is less apparent. In comparison \n243 to RMR, PAEE makes up a smaller portion of TDEE and is more variable; therefore, its impact \n244 on EI may be harder to quantify. However, it can be proposed that PAEE (behavioural EE) will \n245 be a determinant of EI just like RMR (but weaker overall and with great individual variability \u0096\n246 see Figure 1). Recently, a systematic review and a meta-analysis concluded that there is little \n247 evidence that PA or exercise, whether acute or chronic, leads to changes in EI [71, 72]. \n248 However, the acute or relatively short-term nature of these studies may not have been long \n249 enough to demonstrate a compensatory rise in EI with habitual PA [73] and as originally \n250 demonstrated by Mayer et al. [61]. Indeed, a strong relationship was found between \n12\n251 objectively-measured PA (activity counts) and EI (food records) in 300 middle-aged women \n252 [74]. It is important to note that the study by Mayer et al. revealed two separate effects of \n253 habitual PA level on EI, characterised by a J-shape relationship. In the jute mill workers with \n254 higher levels of occupational PA (e.g. \u0093medium\u0094 to \u0093very heavy\u0094 work), daily EE and EI were \n255 closely matched, but at low levels of occupational PA where body mass was also greater, this \n256 coupling was lost, such that daily EI exceeded EE in those performing \u0093sedentary\u0094 to \u0093light\u0094\n257 work [61]. \n258\n259 4.1 The zones of appetite control \n260 Based on the study by Mayer et al. [61], Blundell proposed that appetite control is \n261 enhanced with increasing levels of PA [75]. In contrast, physical inactivity could not only \n262 reduce TDEE but also lead to appetite dysregulation, overconsumption and eventually weight \n263 gain [75]. Indeed, according to Jacobs [76], \u0093the late Henry L Taylor favoured a model that \n264 linked EI to EE in a J-shaped curve (personal communication, late 1970s). The first part of his \n265 concept was that EI is in exact homeostasis with EE under conditions of high EE. The second \n266 part was that there is a failure of homeostasis in a sedentary lifestyle because of its \n267 accompanying low EE. He postulated that body signals go awry in sedentary lifestyles; when \n268 a person does no physical work, the body will not recognize that it is being overfed. Sedentary \n269 persons may lose the innate ability to compensate for inactivity by reducing their eating\u0094 \n270 (p.189). It is important to note here that \u0093sedentary\u0094 lifestyles used by this author should in fact \n271 be interpreted as inactive lifestyle in light of current definitions. Thus, Blundell revisited the \n272 Mayer J-shaped curve and suggested that individuals with low levels of PA could be \n273 considered as being within a \u0093non-regulated zone\u0094 of appetite control, whereas those with\n274 higher levels of PA could be within a \u0093regulated zone\u0094 of appetite control [75]. \n275 While this model of appetite control and EI along the spectrum of PA levels was \n276 originally based on limited evidence, it has recently been supported [7, 77]. In a systematic \n13\n277 review using data from 10 cross-sectional studies that compared EI in active and inactive \n278 individuals, we plotted standardized EI (z-scores) according to four PA levels ranging from low \n279 to very high. This analysis revealed a clear J-shape relationship between PA level and EI [7]. \n280 Similarly, Shook et al. estimated EI based on changes in body composition across quintiles of \n281 PA in a large sample of young adults and again demonstrated appetite dysregulation in those \n282 with the lowest PA [77]. \n283\n284 5. The impact of physical activity and exercise on the mechanisms of appetite control \n285 Emerging studies are shedding light on the mechanisms contributing to the proposed \n286 dysregulation of appetite at lower levels of PA and more sensitive appetite control at higher \n287 levels of PA. These mechanisms may not necessarily be the same along the whole spectrum \n288 of PA levels. Acutely, exercise has been shown to influence gastric emptying [78], attenuate \n289 the release of ghrelin and increase the secretion of PYY, GLP-1 and pancreatic polypeptide \n290 [79]. Chronic exercise may increase the postprandial secretion of GLP-1 and PYY [80]. \n291 Therefore, habitual PA (and exercise) may interact with food intake to enhance hormonal \n292 satiety signalling [81]. Moreover, regular PA and exercise training are associated with several \n293 other physiological adaptations such as improved sensitivity to insulin [82] and leptin [83, 84], \n294 substrate metabolism [85], and body composition [86], which have been proposed as \n295 mechanisms involved in food intake and eating behaviour [87, 88]. Evidence suggests that PA \n296 influences appetite control through a dual-process action which increases the drive to eat but \n297 also post-meal satiety [89]. Several studies have now demonstrated that physically active \n298 individuals show better energy compensation than their less active counterparts following \n299 consumption of preloads differing in energy content such that they reduce EI to offset the \n300 difference in energy consumed from the preloads [10, 90-94]. This preload-test meal paradigm \n301 is effective in measuring the strength of satiety [95]. These improvements in satiety may be \n302 associated with exercise-induced adaptations in episodic satiety signalling [80, 91, 96] or\n303 gastric emptying [97]. In contrast, we have shown that satiation does not appear to be \n14\n304 influenced by PA level in non-obese individuals when measured with a passive \n305 overconsumption paradigm comparing ad libitum EI at meals high in fat or carbohydrate [9]. \n306 However, in overweight and obese individuals, Caudwell et al. [1] showed that exercise \n307 training led to a reduction in EI at a high-fat/energy dense test meal. This may be associated \n308 with enhanced satiation, but given the homeostatic and non-homeostatic determinants of food \n309 intake, may also reflect changes in food hedonics or behavioural traits. \n310 While there is strong support that habitual PA affects homeostatic mechanisms \n311 controlling food intake, less is known on its effect on non-homeostatic processes, and their \n312 contribution to appetite control along the spectrum of PA levels. Indeed, secondary analyses \n313 from the study from Caudwell et al. [1] revealed a reduction in hedonic wanting for high-fat \n314 foods relative to low-fat foods (Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire), disinhibition and binge \n315 eating following exercise training [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. Furthermore, another \n316 study from our group found inverse associations between time spent in MVPA and disinhibition \n317 and binge eating, but these did not remain significant after controlling for body fat [24]. This \n318 corroborates a study by Shook et al. who found greater disinhibition in their lowest quintile of \n319 MVPA but not when controlling for body weight [77], and the aforementioned reduction in \n320 disinhibition and binge eating score following 12 weeks of exercise training which did not \n321 remain significant after controlling for change in body fat [Beaulieu et al., unpublished results]. \n322 These differences in disinhibition and binge eating were not apparent in non-obese individuals \n323 varying in PA levels [9, 10], suggesting the influence of habitual PA on eating behaviour traits \n324 may be more strongly influenced by body composition. In terms of food hedonics, differences \n325 in the rewarding value of foods (liking and wanting) have been observed in lean active \n326 compared to overweight inactive males [98], but in non-obese individuals, PA level did not \n327 influence liking and wanting for high-fat food in the hungry or fed states [9, 10]. In inactive \n328 individuals with overweight and obesity, 12 weeks of exercise training (125-250 kcal per \n329 exercise session) did not affect liking or wanting [99], whereas another 12-week intervention \n330 at a higher dose of exercise (500 kcal per exercise session) reduced the hedonic wanting for \n15\n331 high-fat food independent of changes in body fat [Beaulieu et al. unpublished results]. \n332 Moreover, habitual (self-reported) PA may differently impact food cravings depending on \n333 exercise type and sex [100]. These studies suggest there may be differing effects of PA on\n334 non-homeostatic appetite control according to an individual\u0092s body fat status, sex, and dose \n335 and type of PA. \n336 Therefore, we can propose that in addition to individuals with non-regulated appetite \n337 having blunted satiety signalling, excess body fat in these individuals may amplify non338 homeostatic inputs favouring overconsumption. In contrast, individuals with regulated appetite \n339 with higher levels of PA have enhanced postprandial sensitivity, allowing for EI to be better \n340 matched to EE in response to hunger and satiety signals.

Additionally, individuals with low levels of physical activity are in a \"non-regulated zone\" of appetite control, leading to appetite dysregulation and overconsumption. On the other hand, individuals with higher levels of physical activity are within a \"regulated zone\" of appetite control, allowing for better matching of energy intake to energy expenditure. \n\nFor sports enthusiasts, this study highlights the importance of physical activity not only for fitness but also for appetite control. By staying active, individuals can regulate their appetite and avoid overconsumption, leading to better overall health and performance.
