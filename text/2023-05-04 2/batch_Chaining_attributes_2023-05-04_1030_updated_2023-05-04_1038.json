In the prospective analysis, the incident hypertension risk was attenuated after confounding for cardiovascular (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.94-2.15) and psychiatric (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.65-2.63) comorbidities, emphasizing the importance of exten\u0002sive evaluation of confounders in assessing this association. In the fi rst National Health and Nutrition Exami\u0002nation Survey of 4,810 middle-aged (32-59 years) Americans in fully adjusted models, short sleep dura\u0002tion ( \u0003 5 h\u0002night) was associated with a 60% higher risk of self-reported incident hypertension over an 8- to 10-year follow-up period (hazard ratio, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.58-2.79). 13 No association was found in individuals aged \u0004 60 years.

Note that most of these cross-sectional population studies use subjective reports of sleep duration and not objective data, such as that obtained from prolonged actigraphy moni\u0002toring. Subjective reports of sleep duration may not be accurate. The association between short sleep duration and hypertension appears to be most signifi cant during middle age. The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults cohort examined objective sleep duration by measuring 3-day wrist actigraphy twice between 2003 and 2005, sleep quality, 5-year inci\u0002dence of hypertension, and changes in systolic and diastolic pressure in 578 Americans aged 33 to 45 years at baseline. 16 Short sleep duration predicted increased odds of incident hypertension (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.05-1.78). Each hour of reduced sleep was associated with a 37% increase in the odds of incident hypertension. In a sample of 238 adolescents without sleep apnea or severe comorbidities from the Cleveland Chil\u0002dren\u0092s Sleep and Heart Study, children with short sleep duration ( \u0003 6.5 h\u0002night) had an adjusted OR of prehypertension of 2.54 (95% CI, 0.93-6.90). 17 Fur\u0002thermore, poor sleep effi ciency ( , 85%) on overnight polysomnography was associated with an average adjusted increase in systolic BP of 4 mm Hg, and the odds of prehypertension increased 3.5-fold (95% CI, 1.5-8.0). The researchers defi ned prehypertension as systolic or diastolic BP \u0004 90th percentile for age, sex, and height as noted by the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents. Furthermore, the Sleep Heart Health Study noted that long sleep duration ( \u0004 9 h) is associated with prevalent hypertension (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.04-1.62) compared with individuals sleeping 7 to 8 h. 11 Friedman et al 18 assessed the relationship between self-reported 436 Postgraduate Education Corner sleep duration and 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring in 108 subjects with normal BP and 417 subjects with hypertension.

In the prospective analysis, the incident hypertension risk was attenuated after confounding for cardiovascular (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.94-2.15) and psychiatric (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.65-2.63) comorbidities, emphasizing the importance of exten\u0002sive evaluation of confounders in assessing this association. In the fi rst National Health and Nutrition Exami\u0002nation Survey of 4,810 middle-aged (32-59 years) Americans in fully adjusted models, short sleep dura\u0002tion ( \u0003 5 h\u0002night) was associated with a 60% higher risk of self-reported incident hypertension over an 8- to 10-year follow-up period (hazard ratio, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.58-2.79). 13 No association was found in individuals aged \u0004 60 years. Sleep duration and hypertension may not be associated in persons aged . 58 years. 14 In the 5,058 participants of the population-based Rotterdam study, 14 and a Spanish prospective cohort study of 3,686 persons, 15 no association was found in preva\u0002lent or incident hypertension. Note that most of these cross-sectional population studies use subjective reports of sleep duration and not objective data, such as that obtained from prolonged actigraphy moni\u0002toring. Subjective reports of sleep duration may not be accurate. The association between short sleep duration and hypertension appears to be most signifi cant during middle age. The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults cohort examined objective sleep duration by measuring 3-day wrist actigraphy twice between 2003 and 2005, sleep quality, 5-year inci\u0002dence of hypertension, and changes in systolic and diastolic pressure in 578 Americans aged 33 to 45 years at baseline. 16 Short sleep duration predicted increased odds of incident hypertension (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.05-1.78). Each hour of reduced sleep was associated with a 37% increase in the odds of incident hypertension. In a sample of 238 adolescents without sleep apnea or severe comorbidities from the Cleveland Chil\u0002dren\u0092s Sleep and Heart Study, children with short sleep duration ( \u0003 6.5 h\u0002night) had an adjusted OR of prehypertension of 2.54 (95% CI, 0.93-6.90). 17 Fur\u0002thermore, poor sleep effi ciency ( , 85%) on overnight polysomnography was associated with an average adjusted increase in systolic BP of 4 mm Hg, and the odds of prehypertension increased 3.5-fold (95% CI, 1.5-8.0). The researchers defi ned prehypertension as systolic or diastolic BP \u0004 90th percentile for age, sex, and height as noted by the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents. Furthermore, the Sleep Heart Health Study noted that long sleep duration ( \u0004 9 h) is associated with prevalent hypertension (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.04-1.62) compared with individuals sleeping 7 to 8 h. 11 Friedman et al 18 assessed the relationship between self-reported 436 Postgraduate Education Corner sleep duration and 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring in 108 subjects with normal BP and 417 subjects with hypertension.

In the prospective analysis, the incident hypertension risk was attenuated after confounding for cardiovascular (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.94-2.15) and psychiatric (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.65-2.63) comorbidities, emphasizing the importance of exten\u0002sive evaluation of confounders in assessing this association. In the fi rst National Health and Nutrition Exami\u0002nation Survey of 4,810 middle-aged (32-59 years) Americans in fully adjusted models, short sleep dura\u0002tion ( \u0003 5 h\u0002night) was associated with a 60% higher risk of self-reported incident hypertension over an 8- to 10-year follow-up period (hazard ratio, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.58-2.79). 13 No association was found in individuals aged \u0004 60 years. Sleep duration and hypertension may not be associated in persons aged . 58 years. 14 In the 5,058 participants of the population-based Rotterdam study, 14 and a Spanish prospective cohort study of 3,686 persons, 15 no association was found in preva\u0002lent or incident hypertension. Note that most of these cross-sectional population studies use subjective reports of sleep duration and not objective data, such as that obtained from prolonged actigraphy moni\u0002toring. Subjective reports of sleep duration may not be accurate. The association between short sleep duration and hypertension appears to be most signifi cant during middle age. The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults cohort examined objective sleep duration by measuring 3-day wrist actigraphy twice between 2003 and 2005, sleep quality, 5-year inci\u0002dence of hypertension, and changes in systolic and diastolic pressure in 578 Americans aged 33 to 45 years at baseline. 16 Short sleep duration predicted increased odds of incident hypertension (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.05-1.78). Each hour of reduced sleep was associated with a 37% increase in the odds of incident hypertension. In a sample of 238 adolescents without sleep apnea or severe comorbidities from the Cleveland Chil\u0002dren\u0092s Sleep and Heart Study, children with short sleep duration ( \u0003 6.5 h\u0002night) had an adjusted OR of prehypertension of 2.54 (95% CI, 0.93-6.90). 17 Fur\u0002thermore, poor sleep effi ciency ( , 85%) on overnight polysomnography was associated with an average adjusted increase in systolic BP of 4 mm Hg, and the odds of prehypertension increased 3.5-fold (95% CI, 1.5-8.0). The researchers defi ned prehypertension as systolic or diastolic BP \u0004 90th percentile for age, sex, and height as noted by the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents. Furthermore, the Sleep Heart Health Study noted that long sleep duration ( \u0004 9 h) is associated with prevalent hypertension (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.04-1.62) compared with individuals sleeping 7 to 8 h. 11 Friedman et al 18 assessed the relationship between self-reported 436 Postgraduate Education Corner sleep duration and 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring in 108 subjects with normal BP and 417 subjects with hypertension.
