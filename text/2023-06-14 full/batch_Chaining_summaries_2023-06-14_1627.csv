Abstract
Objective To assess the antifracture efficacy and safety of a nutritional intervention in institutionalised older adults replete in vitamin D but with mean intakes of 600 mg/day calcium and <1 g/kg body weight protein/day.
Design Two year cluster randomised controlled trial.
Setting 60 accredited residential aged care facilities in Australia housing predominantly ambulant residents.
Participants 7195 permanent residents (4920 (68%) female; mean age 86.0 (SD 8.2) years).
Intervention Facilities were stratified by location and organisation, with 30 facilities randomised to provide residents with additional milk, yoghurt, and cheese that contained 562 (166) mg/day calcium and 12 (6) g/day protein achieving a total intake of 1142 (353) mg calcium/day and 69 (15) g/day protein (1.1 g/kg body weight). The 30 control facilities maintained their usual menus, with residents consuming 700 (247) mg/day calcium and 58 (14) g/day protein (0.9 g/kg body weight).
Main outcome measures Group differences in incidence of fractures, falls, and all cause mortality.
Results Data from 27 intervention facilities and 29 control facilities were analysed. A total of 324 fractures (135 hip fractures), 4302 falls, and 1974 deaths were observed. The intervention was associated with risk reductions of 33% for all fractures (121 v 203; hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.93; P=0.02), 46% for hip fractures (42 v 93; 0.54, 0.35 to 0.83; P=0.005), and 11% for falls (1879 v 2423; 0.89, 0.78 to 0.98; P=0.04). The risk reduction for hip fractures and falls achieved significance at five months (P=0.02) and three months (P=0.004), respectively. Mortality was unchanged (900 v 1074; hazard ratio 1.01, 0.43 to 3.08).
Conclusions Improving calcium and protein intakes by using dairy foods is a readily accessible intervention that reduces the risk of falls and fractures commonly occurring in aged care residents.

Introduction
Longevity increases the proportion of older adults in the population. The accompanying increased prevalences of chronic illnesses, loss of musculoskeletal mass, frailty, and bone fragility increase the risk of falls and fractures.1 Loss of independence increases the number of people needing full time institutionalised care, the source of around 30% of all hip fractures in the community.2 Thus, targeting an intervention to all aged care residents is a rational approach to reducing the fracture burden in the whole community.
The widespread use of antiresorptive therapy is unlikely to reduce this fracture burden because of a paucity of evidence of antifracture efficacy in people over 80 years of age, the common occurrence of adverse events, and high cost given the large numbers of people that must be treated.3 However, these people often have calcium intakes below 700 mg daily, an amount unlikely to offset obligatory loss of calcium.4 They also often have protein intakes below 1 g/kg body weight/day, predisposing to loss of lean muscle mass.5 Thus, an alternative approach is to target all institutionalised older adults with a non-pharmaceutical nutritional intervention.
Few studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of a nutritional approach to reduction of fracture risk in aged care residents. Chapuy and colleagues showed antifracture efficacy with pharmacological doses of calcium and vitamin D in female nursing home residents with low calcium intakes and vitamin D deficiency.6 No studies have examined the effects of protein supplementation on reduction of fracture risk, despite evidence of improved muscle function and reduced falls.7
Consumption of milk, yoghurt, and cheese, foods rich in calcium and protein, slows bone loss and improves insulin-like growth factor 1.89 These foods are widely available, palatable, and low cost and so are likely to be adhered to. Accordingly, we conducted a prospective, two year, cluster randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that achieving recommended intakes of 1300 mg/day calcium and 1 g protein/kg body weight will reduce the risk of fragility fractures and falls when targeted to institutionalised older adults replete in vitamin D but with intakes below these levels.
Methods
Study design
This two year, cluster randomised controlled trial involved recruitment of 60 residential aged care facilities housing 7195 older adults in metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria, Australia, between December 2013 and August 2016. To ensure similar standards of care, we recruited only facilities accredited with the Australian Aged-Care Accreditation Agency that housed predominantly ambulant residents. These facilities are similar to residential care in the UK and assisted care facilities in the US. Facilities recruited were representative of charitable, private, and religious organisations, with an even distribution of small (?50 beds), medium (51-100 beds), and large (>100 beds) facilities (supplementary figure C). The ratio of women to men and the age of residents were representative of the national average.10
Inclusion criteria
Randomisation was by facility, not by individuals. For inclusion, facilities were required to provide no more than two servings of dairy foods daily, which was assessed from menu audits, as this level of provision is associated with dietary intakes of <1 g/kg body weight and 600 mg calcium daily.11 Vitamin D adequacy is maintained in residents through routine supplementation as foods are not fortified with vitamin D. We included only permanent residents in data analysesthat is, we excluded data from respite residents.
Randomisation procedure
The unit of randomisation was facility, as the intervention was delivered to all residents by the food service at each facility. Eligible facilities were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either intervention (n=30) or control (n=30), with the control facilities maintaining their existing menus. The randomisation was done with the use of a computer, with block sizes being varied according to organisation (to ensure similar procedures and policies), and was stratified by geographical location (to ensure similar socioeconomic status). A statistician independent of the study did the randomisation and provided the concealed group allocation to the principal investigator (SI) who, in turn, conveyed this allocation to the facility. SI was not involved in any data collection. An organisation may have between two and 10 facilities, and randomisation was done within an organisation.
Consent
Facility managers consented to provide de-identified details of age and sex of residents, as well as access to all incident reports including those for falls and fractures. Reporting of all incidents of any nature is a mandatory requirement of all accredited aged care providers. The accreditation agency regularly audits incident reports. Facilities are sanctioned if breaches are observed, with potential for accreditation to be revoked and government funding terminated. Falls (time, location, circumstances, and outcome/injury), fractures, and other adverse events were verified from these incident reports. These reports were maintained at all facilities. An independent medically trained person blinded to study allocation verified fractures by using hospital radiographs and radiographic reports. Residents and families were informed of the study during regular meetings. A subset of 371 residents from all facilities voluntarily consented to have dietary intake recorded, medical records reviewed, blood sampling, and measurement of body composition, bone mineral density, and bone microarchitecture performed. A next of kin consented for an additional 345 residents to allow dietary intake to be recorded and medical records reviewed.
Intervention
We classified dairy foods by using the Australian Dietary Guidelines, with a serving defined as 250 mL of milk, 200 g of yoghurt, and 40 g of cheese.12 Lactose-free options were provided to accommodate the few participants (<0.001%) with reported lactose intolerance. Butter, cream, and ice cream were not provided, as they contain little calcium or protein. All facilities prepared and cooked foods on site. We assigned intervention facilities a food service dietician to assist food service staff to increase the provision of dairy foods at all meals and snacks. Methods used to increase dairy foods included use of milk powder to fortify milk used in recipes and beverages. Dairy based desserts and snacks were offered in place of less nutritious foods such as cakes and biscuits. Foods provided were based on the preferences expressed by the residents at intervention sites.
Dairy foods were provided in-kind by Fonterra International (New Zealand) and distributed by a commercial food distribution company not associated with the project (Bidfoods, Australia). Use of a single distributor ensured accurate recording of costs for all dairy foods provided, with invoices used to verify compliance data. During dietary assessments, foods and beverages were weighed on a food scale (±1 g) (Sohnele Page Profi, Germany) at all facilities. During two days every three months, dieticians assessed compliance by using the validated visual estimation of plate waste, with data collected from 55 000 foods and beverages during the study.13 We used nutritional analysis software (FoodWorks, Australia) or the Australian food composition database NUTTAB 2010 to calculate nutrient intakes.
Data monitoring
Data safety monitoring was carried out by the Study Trial Review Board, which was provided with quarterly reports.
Outcomes
As per the approved study protocol, all pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes have been reported. The primary outcome was time to fragility fracture. Secondary outcomes were time to fall and changes in bone morphology and biochemistry. The tertiary outcomes of all cause mortality and changes in body composition are also reported. Exploratory outcomes including quality of life and muscle function were not examined (see original and final study protocols). Fasting morning serum samples were obtained from 189 residents at baseline and 12 months for measurement of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (baseline only), C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (a measure of bone resorption), procollagen type 1 N propeptide (a measure of bone formation), parathyroid hormone (Roche Cobas E170), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (LIASON) (supplementary figure A).
Body composition and bone morphology were assessed at baseline and 12 months in 72 residents (supplementary figure B). Total and appendicular (arms and legs) lean mass and fat mass were determined from total body scans, and bone mineral density was measured at the lumbar spine and femoral neck using dual x-ray absorptiometry (Prodigy, GE Lunar, Madison, WI, CV=1%). Volumetric bone mineral density (the amount of bone contained within the external volume of bone, in g/cm3) was measured at the distal tibia and distal radius by using high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (Scanco Medical AG, Switzerland, CV 0.54.0%).14 Cortical porosity was determined using automated image processing (StrAx1.0, Straxcorp, Melbourne, Australia).
Blinding and sample size
Once a facility was randomised, only the principal investigator, food service research dieticians, facility managers, and food service staff were aware of the allocation. Data acquisition and analyses were carried out by staff blinded to group allocation (SP, XW, MB, AGZ, and TN). Residents were blinded to the study; permission to conduct the study was obtained from the aged-care provider and facility managers. Some of the intervention strategies were not visiblefor example, fortification of milk with milk powder or modification of recipes. Some residents may have been aware of some changes, such as provision of cheese and biscuits for snacks, but not the reason for the changes.
The sample size was determined on the basis of a hypothesised effect size and intra-cluster correlation coefficient (r). Under the hypothesis that the intervention reduces the risk of fracture by 30%, based on previous antifracture calcium/vitamin D intervention in this setting, and that r ranges from 0.10 to 0.50, the sample size needed was 25 to 50 residents per facility and 25 facilities per arm to achieve the power of 80%.6 From falls data, we used an r of 0.20 to calculate the sample size.15 To account for approximately 20% annual attrition, we recruited 60 facilities with a minimum of 50 residents per facility.
At the start of the study, 3980 permanent residents were living in the participating facilities. We refer to these residents as the inception cohort. Recruitment continued throughout the 24 months to ensure that the required sample size was maintained, so we included data from residents admitted to facilities that replaced initial residents lost to follow-up due to death or discharge in analyses. We refer to these residents as the replacement cohort. In total, an additional 3215 residents were admitted to facilities after the study had started. We obtained details of new residents and those lost to follow-up from admission and discharge records from each facility.
Analyses
We expressed baseline data as mean and standard deviation, with the unit of analysis being clusters. We expressed fracture incidence, falls, and deaths per 100 person years of follow-up. We used the product limit (Kaplan-Meier) method to determine the cumulative risk of an event. No data were missing for these primary and secondary outcomes. The duration of follow-up was based on date of study entry to date of an event. When no event occurred, duration of follow-up was date of study entry to date of study termination.
As individuals were nested within clusters (facilities), the primary analysis was based on the mixed effects Coxs proportional hazards model; effects of intervention, age, and sex were fixed effects, and the facility was considered the random effect (see supplementary methods for additional statistical analysis). We expressed the results as a hazard ratio with 95% confidence limits. We used the coxme package to estimate model parameters. We also used the Fine-Gray sub-distribution method with the cmprsk package to do mortality competing risk analysis.
We tested between group differences in serum biomarkers and measurements of body composition and bone morphology at baseline with the weighted t test, with cluster being the unit of analysis. Biomarkers were log transformed if they were not normally distributed. We analysed effects of the intervention by using the mixed effects model in which the within person change in outcome was modelled as a function of treatment or control group, time of follow-up, age, weight, and sex. All analyses used the R Statistical Environment.
Amendments to protocol and statistical analysis plan
Initially, facilities were matched only by location to account for socioeconomic status. We also accounted for organisations, as they contributed varying numbers of facilities and had different policies and procedures. We included facilities providing less than two servings of dairy food daily, as dietary assessments for all residents was not feasible. We quantified two day instead of three day diets, as this was adequate to capture regular intakes.11 We did not assess osteocalcin, as sufficient information is obtained from C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and procollagen type 1 N propeptide. We used only all cause mortality as a tertiary outcome, as cardiovascular events were not obtainable and causes of death were poorly documented. We did not examine exploratory outcomes related to quality of life and muscle function, as unanticipated attrition reduced the sample size resulting in insufficient power to detect an effect of treatment. We did not include bayesian analyses and imputations, as no values were missing for falls and fracture outcomes (original and final study protocols).
Patient and public involvement
We consulted aged care residents, providers, and food service staff after the initial feasibility study that guided the design of this intervention.16 The manuscript was read by non-academics.
Results
Of the 60 facilities, 54 completed the 24 month intervention (fig 1). One control facility and three intervention facilities withdrew after randomisation. Two intervention facilities closed at months 15 and 20, but we included the data up to the date of closure. At baseline, the two groups had comparable demographics and were vitamin D replete. Daily baseline calcium and protein intakes were 689 (SD 266) mg and 57 (16) g respectively (table 1; supplementary figure D).
Nutritional changes
Dairy food intake increased from 2.0 to 3.5 servings daily in the intervention facilities (fig 2). The additional dairy foods, equivalent to 250 mL of milk plus 20 g cheese or 100 g yoghurt, provided 562 (166) mg calcium, achieving 1142 (353) mg calcium daily, and 12 (6) g protein, achieving an intake of 69 (15) g (1.1 g/kg body weight) daily. In control facilities, residents dairy intakes remained at less than two servings daily providing 700 (247) mg calcium and 58 (14) g protein (0.9 g/kg body weight) daily. No adverse gastrointestinal events related to the intervention were reported. No detectable within or between group differences in energy intake were observed during follow-up (fig 2). However, we observed group differences for the change in body weight (table 2). In absolute terms, no weight change occurred in the intervention group (0.3 (95% confidence interval ?0.8 to 1.4) kg; P=0.56). In controls, a weight loss of 1.4 (0.6 to 2.1) kg, (P<0.001) was due to a 0.3 (?0.6 to 0.0) kg decline in appendicular lean mass (P=0.03) and 0.8 kg (?1.6 to ?0.2) decline in total body fat mass (P=0.02).
Fractures, falls, and mortality
During 90 557 person months of follow-up (mean 12.6 (8.9) months), 324 fractures occurred: 121 (3.7%) in the intervention group and 203 (5.2%) in controlsa 33% risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.93; P=0.02). Post hoc analysis indicated that the incidence of hip fracture was 1.3% (n=42) in the intervention group and 2.4% (n=93) in controlsa 46% risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.54, 0.35 to 0.83; P=0.005). The separation in cumulative incidence of fractures between the groups achieved significance at five months for all fractures (P=0.02) and hip fractures (P=0.02) (fig 3). Competing risk analysis adjusted for mortality showed that the intervention was associated with average reductions in fracture risk of 27% (hazard ratio 0.73, 0.58 to 0.92) for all fractures and 44% (0.56, 0.39 to 0.82) for hip fractures.
The cumulative incidence of falls was 57% (n=1879) in the intervention group and 62% (n=2423) in controlsan 11% relative risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.89, 0.78 to 0.98; P=0.04). The separation in the incidence of falls between groups achieved significance at three months (P=0.04) (fig 3). All but one fracture was the result of a fall. Mortality did not differ between the intervention and control groups (27% (n=900) v 28% (n=1074), respectively; hazard ratio 1.01, 0.43 to 3.08; P=0.91) (fig 3). The numbers needing treatment to prevent any fracture, hip fracture, or a fall were 52, 82, and 17, respectively.
To explore the veracity of the observations made in the entire cohort (n=7195), we examined the effects of the intervention on fracture risk and falls relative to controls in a post hoc analyses of residents present at the start of the study (n=3980, the inception cohort) and residents added after its start (n=3215, the replacement cohort), separately. The inception cohort was older than the replacement cohort (mean 86.5 (8.1) v 85.2 (8.4) years; P<0.001). However, age did not differ between the intervention and control groups in either the inception cohort (mean 86.7 (8.2) v 86.4 (8.0) years, respectively; P=0.25) or the replacement cohort (85.1 (8.5) v 85.3 (8.2) years, respectively; P=0.601). We observed significant reductions in all fractures, hip fractures, and falls in the intervention group relative to the controls in both the inception and replacement cohorts (see supplementary figure E).
Biochemistry and bone morphology
The subgroup providing data for biochemistry, body composition, and bone morphology did not differ from the entire cohort in age (mean 85.9 (8.2) v 85.6 (8.2) years), proportion of women to men (70% (n=74) v 69% (n=57)), and proportion with previous fractures (38% (n=40) v 39 (n=32)). As shown in table 2, at 12 months, we observed a 20.4% between group difference in serum C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (P=0.002), the result of no change in the intervention group and a 13.1% increase in controls (P<0.05). We observed no between group difference in procollagen type 1 N propeptide or parathyroid hormone, but we observed a 7.9% between group difference in serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (P=0.04), the result of a 5.9% increase in the intervention group (P<0.05) and no change in controls.
We observed a 1.8% between group difference in spine bone mineral density (P=0.04), the result of a 2.1% increase in the intervention group (P<0.001) and no change in controls. The 1.7% between group difference in femoral neck bone mineral density was not significant (P=0.09). The 3.3% between group difference in distal radius total volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.02) and 2.0% between group difference in distal tibial total volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.07) were the result of decreases at each site in controls (both P<0.05). We observed a 4.6% between group difference in distal radial trabecular volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.03) due to a non-significant decrease in controls and a 0.7% increase in distal tibia cortical porosity in controls (P<0.05).
Discussion
This nutritional approach using high calcium and high protein dairy foods to increase calcium and protein intakes in institutionalised older adults replete in vitamin D was associated with a 33% reduction in risk of fractures of any type, a 46% reduction in risk of hip fractures, and an 11% reduction in risk of falls relative to controls. We found no group difference in all cause mortality.
Most interventions aimed at reducing fracture risk target a drug therapy to people with osteoporosis because they are at high risk of fracture. This approach confers a large benefit to the individual and does so cost effectively, because few people need to be treated to avert one event. However, averting fractures in small numbers of people at high risk does not reduce the burden of fractures in the community.
The population burden of fracturesthe number of events, morbidity, mortality, and cost to the communityarises from the vast numbers of people with risk factors that confer a modest attributable risk to the individual.17 For example, most fragility fractures in the community arise among women with osteopenia (bone mineral density T score 2.5 to 1 SD) because they form the largest segment of the community.18 Likewise, most fractures attributable to nutritional inadequacy arise among the great many people with intakes of calcium and protein that are below recommended levels.19 This nutritional inadequacy confers a small attributable risk to the individual but accounts for a large attributable fraction of the fracture burden in the community as a whole. This is the Geoffrey Rose prevention paradoxa community based approach producing a small benefit to an individual may still confer a large benefit to the community.17 Safety is essential because most individuals treated may derive little or no benefit from the intervention. For example, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension study reduced blood pressure by replacing a western diet with a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, and low fat dairy foodsan approach associated with fewer cardiovascular events.20
Comparison with other studies
Most nutrition based studies assessing antifracture efficacy in aged care residents and people in the community used pharmacological doses of calcium with or without vitamin D.21 In a meta-analysis of 17 of these studies, only two studies reported a reduction in fracture riska study of nursing home residents with calcium intakes <600 mg/day and vitamin D concentrations <50 nmol/L and a community based study in women and men ?65 years of age with mean calcium intakes of 700 mg/day.21 In the remaining 15 studies, poor compliance, large numbers of dropouts, and a low prevalence of the risk factor may have contributed to the null findings.2223 Benefits are unlikely if the prevalence of a risk factor (such as inadequate calcium and protein intakes) is low.24 For example, in the meta-analysis, reduction in fracture risk reported with treatment was confined to the 7272 individuals with calcium intakes <700 mg/day (risk ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.89), not the 45 241 individuals with calcium intakes above 700 mg daily.21 The reduction in fracture risk observed with calcium and protein rich foods in this study may have been the result of attention to several of the above factors. Compliance was optimised by supervised provision and consumption of the foods. Participants lost to follow-up were replaced by newly admitted residents. We intentionally targeted a cohort at high risk for fracture in whom low calcium and protein intakes were common and so were likely to partly contribute to the already high fracture burden in this community.
Mechanisms of fracture risk reduction
This nutritional intervention produced two unanticipated novel observations. The risk reduction for falls and fractures was detected by three and five months, respectively, and the relative risk reduction for fractures was similar to that found in trials using potent antiresorptive therapy to treat people at high risk due to osteoporosis. The two most likely explanations for each of these observations is a risk reduction for falls and slowing progression of bone fragility. Insulin-like growth factor 1 increased in the intervention group only, whereas the decrease in appendicular lean mass was confined to controls, consistent with the notion that protein intakes of 1-1.5 g/kg/day is needed to prevent protein catabolism and preserve or increase muscle mass in older adults, particularly those at risk of malnutrition or frailty.25 The increase in serum C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and deterioration in tibial and radial total volumetric bone mineral density in controls was not seen in the intervention group, consistent with slowing of bone loss and slowing of microstructural deterioration.26 These changes were modest, but slowing microstructural deterioration disproportionately reduces progression of bone fragility because fragility increases as a power function to the bone loss producing it.27
Mortality did not differ between the groups. Some, but not all, studies suggest that milk consumption is associated with increased mortality but consumption of yoghurt and cheese (fermented foods) with reduced mortality and favourable blood lipid profiles.282930 Fermented and non-fermented dairy foods were used during the intervention. Milk consumption did not differ between the intervention and control groups (data not shown).
Limitations of study
The study has several limitations. Less than half of the participants had follow-up longer than 15 months. However, the reduction in risk of fractures and falls was detected within six months. Measures of dietary intakes and causes of secondary osteoporosis were obtained from the subgroup of 716 consented participants, not all 7195 residents, so compliance was monitored in about 10% of residents. However, recorded intakes of 55 000 foods and beverages are likely to be representative of all residents as most, if not all, food is provided by facilities. Assessment of body composition, bone morphology, and biochemistry was confined to a subgroup of residents. Attrition of these participants limited the power to examine differences in body composition, bone morphology, and biochemistry between the groups. Therefore, our ability to make inferences concerning the role of this intervention in slowing microstructural deterioration and loss of muscle mass is limited. Serum parathyroid hormone remained unchanged, perhaps owing to administration of around 1100 mg of calcium throughout the day as food, not as a single supplement of elemental calcium.31 Moreover, this intervention used whole dairy foods, so any potential benefit of other components of the dairy matrix cannot be determined.
Summary and conclusions
In summary, ageing of the population is associated with a greater number of older adults needing full time institutionalised care. These individuals are often malnourished.5 Although the risk of fracture attributable to undernutrition may be small in an individual, the large number of older adults in aged care confers a large fracture burden in the community; institutionalised people are the source of about 30% of all hip fractures.217 A high calcium and high protein nutritional intervention reduced the risk of falls and fractures. This intervention was tailored to the preferences of the residents and was successfully delivered through the food service using regular retail milk, yoghurt, and cheese incorporated into existing menus. In conclusion, this nutritional intervention has widespread implications as a public health measure for fracture prevention in the aged care setting and potentially in the wider community.

A nutritional intervention using dairy foods rich in calcium and protein has been found to reduce the risk of fractures and falls in older adults in residential care. The two-year study, conducted in Australia, included 7,195 permanent residents with mean age 86 years. The intervention group received additional milk, yogurt, and cheese, resulting in a total intake of 1,142 mg calcium and 69 g protein per day. Compared to the control group, the intervention group experienced a 33% reduction in all fractures, a 46% reduction in hip fractures, and an 11% reduction in falls. These risk reductions were detected within three to five months of starting the intervention.

Abstract
Objective To assess the antifracture efficacy and safety of a nutritional intervention in institutionalised older adults replete in vitamin D but with mean intakes of 600 mg/day calcium and <1 g/kg body weight protein/day.
Design Two year cluster randomised controlled trial.
Setting 60 accredited residential aged care facilities in Australia housing predominantly ambulant residents.
Participants 7195 permanent residents (4920 (68%) female; mean age 86.0 (SD 8.2) years).
Intervention Facilities were stratified by location and organisation, with 30 facilities randomised to provide residents with additional milk, yoghurt, and cheese that contained 562 (166) mg/day calcium and 12 (6) g/day protein achieving a total intake of 1142 (353) mg calcium/day and 69 (15) g/day protein (1.1 g/kg body weight). The 30 control facilities maintained their usual menus, with residents consuming 700 (247) mg/day calcium and 58 (14) g/day protein (0.9 g/kg body weight).
Main outcome measures Group differences in incidence of fractures, falls, and all cause mortality.
Results Data from 27 intervention facilities and 29 control facilities were analysed. A total of 324 fractures (135 hip fractures), 4302 falls, and 1974 deaths were observed. The intervention was associated with risk reductions of 33% for all fractures (121 v 203; hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.93; P=0.02), 46% for hip fractures (42 v 93; 0.54, 0.35 to 0.83; P=0.005), and 11% for falls (1879 v 2423; 0.89, 0.78 to 0.98; P=0.04). The risk reduction for hip fractures and falls achieved significance at five months (P=0.02) and three months (P=0.004), respectively. Mortality was unchanged (900 v 1074; hazard ratio 1.01, 0.43 to 3.08).
Conclusions Improving calcium and protein intakes by using dairy foods is a readily accessible intervention that reduces the risk of falls and fractures commonly occurring in aged care residents.

Introduction
Longevity increases the proportion of older adults in the population. The accompanying increased prevalences of chronic illnesses, loss of musculoskeletal mass, frailty, and bone fragility increase the risk of falls and fractures.1 Loss of independence increases the number of people needing full time institutionalised care, the source of around 30% of all hip fractures in the community.2 Thus, targeting an intervention to all aged care residents is a rational approach to reducing the fracture burden in the whole community.
The widespread use of antiresorptive therapy is unlikely to reduce this fracture burden because of a paucity of evidence of antifracture efficacy in people over 80 years of age, the common occurrence of adverse events, and high cost given the large numbers of people that must be treated.3 However, these people often have calcium intakes below 700 mg daily, an amount unlikely to offset obligatory loss of calcium.4 They also often have protein intakes below 1 g/kg body weight/day, predisposing to loss of lean muscle mass.5 Thus, an alternative approach is to target all institutionalised older adults with a non-pharmaceutical nutritional intervention.
Few studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of a nutritional approach to reduction of fracture risk in aged care residents. Chapuy and colleagues showed antifracture efficacy with pharmacological doses of calcium and vitamin D in female nursing home residents with low calcium intakes and vitamin D deficiency.6 No studies have examined the effects of protein supplementation on reduction of fracture risk, despite evidence of improved muscle function and reduced falls.7
Consumption of milk, yoghurt, and cheese, foods rich in calcium and protein, slows bone loss and improves insulin-like growth factor 1.89 These foods are widely available, palatable, and low cost and so are likely to be adhered to. Accordingly, we conducted a prospective, two year, cluster randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that achieving recommended intakes of 1300 mg/day calcium and 1 g protein/kg body weight will reduce the risk of fragility fractures and falls when targeted to institutionalised older adults replete in vitamin D but with intakes below these levels.
Methods
Study design
This two year, cluster randomised controlled trial involved recruitment of 60 residential aged care facilities housing 7195 older adults in metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria, Australia, between December 2013 and August 2016. To ensure similar standards of care, we recruited only facilities accredited with the Australian Aged-Care Accreditation Agency that housed predominantly ambulant residents. These facilities are similar to residential care in the UK and assisted care facilities in the US. Facilities recruited were representative of charitable, private, and religious organisations, with an even distribution of small (?50 beds), medium (51-100 beds), and large (>100 beds) facilities (supplementary figure C). The ratio of women to men and the age of residents were representative of the national average.10
Inclusion criteria
Randomisation was by facility, not by individuals. For inclusion, facilities were required to provide no more than two servings of dairy foods daily, which was assessed from menu audits, as this level of provision is associated with dietary intakes of <1 g/kg body weight and 600 mg calcium daily.11 Vitamin D adequacy is maintained in residents through routine supplementation as foods are not fortified with vitamin D. We included only permanent residents in data analysesthat is, we excluded data from respite residents.
Randomisation procedure
The unit of randomisation was facility, as the intervention was delivered to all residents by the food service at each facility. Eligible facilities were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either intervention (n=30) or control (n=30), with the control facilities maintaining their existing menus. The randomisation was done with the use of a computer, with block sizes being varied according to organisation (to ensure similar procedures and policies), and was stratified by geographical location (to ensure similar socioeconomic status). A statistician independent of the study did the randomisation and provided the concealed group allocation to the principal investigator (SI) who, in turn, conveyed this allocation to the facility. SI was not involved in any data collection. An organisation may have between two and 10 facilities, and randomisation was done within an organisation.
Consent
Facility managers consented to provide de-identified details of age and sex of residents, as well as access to all incident reports including those for falls and fractures. Reporting of all incidents of any nature is a mandatory requirement of all accredited aged care providers. The accreditation agency regularly audits incident reports. Facilities are sanctioned if breaches are observed, with potential for accreditation to be revoked and government funding terminated. Falls (time, location, circumstances, and outcome/injury), fractures, and other adverse events were verified from these incident reports. These reports were maintained at all facilities. An independent medically trained person blinded to study allocation verified fractures by using hospital radiographs and radiographic reports. Residents and families were informed of the study during regular meetings. A subset of 371 residents from all facilities voluntarily consented to have dietary intake recorded, medical records reviewed, blood sampling, and measurement of body composition, bone mineral density, and bone microarchitecture performed. A next of kin consented for an additional 345 residents to allow dietary intake to be recorded and medical records reviewed.
Intervention
We classified dairy foods by using the Australian Dietary Guidelines, with a serving defined as 250 mL of milk, 200 g of yoghurt, and 40 g of cheese.12 Lactose-free options were provided to accommodate the few participants (<0.001%) with reported lactose intolerance. Butter, cream, and ice cream were not provided, as they contain little calcium or protein. All facilities prepared and cooked foods on site. We assigned intervention facilities a food service dietician to assist food service staff to increase the provision of dairy foods at all meals and snacks. Methods used to increase dairy foods included use of milk powder to fortify milk used in recipes and beverages. Dairy based desserts and snacks were offered in place of less nutritious foods such as cakes and biscuits. Foods provided were based on the preferences expressed by the residents at intervention sites.
Dairy foods were provided in-kind by Fonterra International (New Zealand) and distributed by a commercial food distribution company not associated with the project (Bidfoods, Australia). Use of a single distributor ensured accurate recording of costs for all dairy foods provided, with invoices used to verify compliance data. During dietary assessments, foods and beverages were weighed on a food scale (±1 g) (Sohnele Page Profi, Germany) at all facilities. During two days every three months, dieticians assessed compliance by using the validated visual estimation of plate waste, with data collected from 55 000 foods and beverages during the study.13 We used nutritional analysis software (FoodWorks, Australia) or the Australian food composition database NUTTAB 2010 to calculate nutrient intakes.
Data monitoring
Data safety monitoring was carried out by the Study Trial Review Board, which was provided with quarterly reports.
Outcomes
As per the approved study protocol, all pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes have been reported. The primary outcome was time to fragility fracture. Secondary outcomes were time to fall and changes in bone morphology and biochemistry. The tertiary outcomes of all cause mortality and changes in body composition are also reported. Exploratory outcomes including quality of life and muscle function were not examined (see original and final study protocols). Fasting morning serum samples were obtained from 189 residents at baseline and 12 months for measurement of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (baseline only), C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (a measure of bone resorption), procollagen type 1 N propeptide (a measure of bone formation), parathyroid hormone (Roche Cobas E170), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (LIASON) (supplementary figure A).
Body composition and bone morphology were assessed at baseline and 12 months in 72 residents (supplementary figure B). Total and appendicular (arms and legs) lean mass and fat mass were determined from total body scans, and bone mineral density was measured at the lumbar spine and femoral neck using dual x-ray absorptiometry (Prodigy, GE Lunar, Madison, WI, CV=1%). Volumetric bone mineral density (the amount of bone contained within the external volume of bone, in g/cm3) was measured at the distal tibia and distal radius by using high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (Scanco Medical AG, Switzerland, CV 0.54.0%).14 Cortical porosity was determined using automated image processing (StrAx1.0, Straxcorp, Melbourne, Australia).
Blinding and sample size
Once a facility was randomised, only the principal investigator, food service research dieticians, facility managers, and food service staff were aware of the allocation. Data acquisition and analyses were carried out by staff blinded to group allocation (SP, XW, MB, AGZ, and TN). Residents were blinded to the study; permission to conduct the study was obtained from the aged-care provider and facility managers. Some of the intervention strategies were not visiblefor example, fortification of milk with milk powder or modification of recipes. Some residents may have been aware of some changes, such as provision of cheese and biscuits for snacks, but not the reason for the changes.
The sample size was determined on the basis of a hypothesised effect size and intra-cluster correlation coefficient (r). Under the hypothesis that the intervention reduces the risk of fracture by 30%, based on previous antifracture calcium/vitamin D intervention in this setting, and that r ranges from 0.10 to 0.50, the sample size needed was 25 to 50 residents per facility and 25 facilities per arm to achieve the power of 80%.6 From falls data, we used an r of 0.20 to calculate the sample size.15 To account for approximately 20% annual attrition, we recruited 60 facilities with a minimum of 50 residents per facility.
At the start of the study, 3980 permanent residents were living in the participating facilities. We refer to these residents as the inception cohort. Recruitment continued throughout the 24 months to ensure that the required sample size was maintained, so we included data from residents admitted to facilities that replaced initial residents lost to follow-up due to death or discharge in analyses. We refer to these residents as the replacement cohort. In total, an additional 3215 residents were admitted to facilities after the study had started. We obtained details of new residents and those lost to follow-up from admission and discharge records from each facility.
Analyses
We expressed baseline data as mean and standard deviation, with the unit of analysis being clusters. We expressed fracture incidence, falls, and deaths per 100 person years of follow-up. We used the product limit (Kaplan-Meier) method to determine the cumulative risk of an event. No data were missing for these primary and secondary outcomes. The duration of follow-up was based on date of study entry to date of an event. When no event occurred, duration of follow-up was date of study entry to date of study termination.
As individuals were nested within clusters (facilities), the primary analysis was based on the mixed effects Coxs proportional hazards model; effects of intervention, age, and sex were fixed effects, and the facility was considered the random effect (see supplementary methods for additional statistical analysis). We expressed the results as a hazard ratio with 95% confidence limits. We used the coxme package to estimate model parameters. We also used the Fine-Gray sub-distribution method with the cmprsk package to do mortality competing risk analysis.
We tested between group differences in serum biomarkers and measurements of body composition and bone morphology at baseline with the weighted t test, with cluster being the unit of analysis. Biomarkers were log transformed if they were not normally distributed. We analysed effects of the intervention by using the mixed effects model in which the within person change in outcome was modelled as a function of treatment or control group, time of follow-up, age, weight, and sex. All analyses used the R Statistical Environment.
Amendments to protocol and statistical analysis plan
Initially, facilities were matched only by location to account for socioeconomic status. We also accounted for organisations, as they contributed varying numbers of facilities and had different policies and procedures. We included facilities providing less than two servings of dairy food daily, as dietary assessments for all residents was not feasible. We quantified two day instead of three day diets, as this was adequate to capture regular intakes.11 We did not assess osteocalcin, as sufficient information is obtained from C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and procollagen type 1 N propeptide. We used only all cause mortality as a tertiary outcome, as cardiovascular events were not obtainable and causes of death were poorly documented. We did not examine exploratory outcomes related to quality of life and muscle function, as unanticipated attrition reduced the sample size resulting in insufficient power to detect an effect of treatment. We did not include bayesian analyses and imputations, as no values were missing for falls and fracture outcomes (original and final study protocols).
Patient and public involvement
We consulted aged care residents, providers, and food service staff after the initial feasibility study that guided the design of this intervention.16 The manuscript was read by non-academics.
Results
Of the 60 facilities, 54 completed the 24 month intervention (fig 1). One control facility and three intervention facilities withdrew after randomisation. Two intervention facilities closed at months 15 and 20, but we included the data up to the date of closure. At baseline, the two groups had comparable demographics and were vitamin D replete. Daily baseline calcium and protein intakes were 689 (SD 266) mg and 57 (16) g respectively (table 1; supplementary figure D).
Nutritional changes
Dairy food intake increased from 2.0 to 3.5 servings daily in the intervention facilities (fig 2). The additional dairy foods, equivalent to 250 mL of milk plus 20 g cheese or 100 g yoghurt, provided 562 (166) mg calcium, achieving 1142 (353) mg calcium daily, and 12 (6) g protein, achieving an intake of 69 (15) g (1.1 g/kg body weight) daily. In control facilities, residents dairy intakes remained at less than two servings daily providing 700 (247) mg calcium and 58 (14) g protein (0.9 g/kg body weight) daily. No adverse gastrointestinal events related to the intervention were reported. No detectable within or between group differences in energy intake were observed during follow-up (fig 2). However, we observed group differences for the change in body weight (table 2). In absolute terms, no weight change occurred in the intervention group (0.3 (95% confidence interval ?0.8 to 1.4) kg; P=0.56). In controls, a weight loss of 1.4 (0.6 to 2.1) kg, (P<0.001) was due to a 0.3 (?0.6 to 0.0) kg decline in appendicular lean mass (P=0.03) and 0.8 kg (?1.6 to ?0.2) decline in total body fat mass (P=0.02).
Fractures, falls, and mortality
During 90 557 person months of follow-up (mean 12.6 (8.9) months), 324 fractures occurred: 121 (3.7%) in the intervention group and 203 (5.2%) in controlsa 33% risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.93; P=0.02). Post hoc analysis indicated that the incidence of hip fracture was 1.3% (n=42) in the intervention group and 2.4% (n=93) in controlsa 46% risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.54, 0.35 to 0.83; P=0.005). The separation in cumulative incidence of fractures between the groups achieved significance at five months for all fractures (P=0.02) and hip fractures (P=0.02) (fig 3). Competing risk analysis adjusted for mortality showed that the intervention was associated with average reductions in fracture risk of 27% (hazard ratio 0.73, 0.58 to 0.92) for all fractures and 44% (0.56, 0.39 to 0.82) for hip fractures.
The cumulative incidence of falls was 57% (n=1879) in the intervention group and 62% (n=2423) in controlsan 11% relative risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.89, 0.78 to 0.98; P=0.04). The separation in the incidence of falls between groups achieved significance at three months (P=0.04) (fig 3). All but one fracture was the result of a fall. Mortality did not differ between the intervention and control groups (27% (n=900) v 28% (n=1074), respectively; hazard ratio 1.01, 0.43 to 3.08; P=0.91) (fig 3). The numbers needing treatment to prevent any fracture, hip fracture, or a fall were 52, 82, and 17, respectively.
To explore the veracity of the observations made in the entire cohort (n=7195), we examined the effects of the intervention on fracture risk and falls relative to controls in a post hoc analyses of residents present at the start of the study (n=3980, the inception cohort) and residents added after its start (n=3215, the replacement cohort), separately. The inception cohort was older than the replacement cohort (mean 86.5 (8.1) v 85.2 (8.4) years; P<0.001). However, age did not differ between the intervention and control groups in either the inception cohort (mean 86.7 (8.2) v 86.4 (8.0) years, respectively; P=0.25) or the replacement cohort (85.1 (8.5) v 85.3 (8.2) years, respectively; P=0.601). We observed significant reductions in all fractures, hip fractures, and falls in the intervention group relative to the controls in both the inception and replacement cohorts (see supplementary figure E).
Biochemistry and bone morphology
The subgroup providing data for biochemistry, body composition, and bone morphology did not differ from the entire cohort in age (mean 85.9 (8.2) v 85.6 (8.2) years), proportion of women to men (70% (n=74) v 69% (n=57)), and proportion with previous fractures (38% (n=40) v 39 (n=32)). As shown in table 2, at 12 months, we observed a 20.4% between group difference in serum C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (P=0.002), the result of no change in the intervention group and a 13.1% increase in controls (P<0.05). We observed no between group difference in procollagen type 1 N propeptide or parathyroid hormone, but we observed a 7.9% between group difference in serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (P=0.04), the result of a 5.9% increase in the intervention group (P<0.05) and no change in controls.
We observed a 1.8% between group difference in spine bone mineral density (P=0.04), the result of a 2.1% increase in the intervention group (P<0.001) and no change in controls. The 1.7% between group difference in femoral neck bone mineral density was not significant (P=0.09). The 3.3% between group difference in distal radius total volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.02) and 2.0% between group difference in distal tibial total volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.07) were the result of decreases at each site in controls (both P<0.05). We observed a 4.6% between group difference in distal radial trabecular volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.03) due to a non-significant decrease in controls and a 0.7% increase in distal tibia cortical porosity in controls (P<0.05).
Discussion
This nutritional approach using high calcium and high protein dairy foods to increase calcium and protein intakes in institutionalised older adults replete in vitamin D was associated with a 33% reduction in risk of fractures of any type, a 46% reduction in risk of hip fractures, and an 11% reduction in risk of falls relative to controls. We found no group difference in all cause mortality.
Most interventions aimed at reducing fracture risk target a drug therapy to people with osteoporosis because they are at high risk of fracture. This approach confers a large benefit to the individual and does so cost effectively, because few people need to be treated to avert one event. However, averting fractures in small numbers of people at high risk does not reduce the burden of fractures in the community.
The population burden of fracturesthe number of events, morbidity, mortality, and cost to the communityarises from the vast numbers of people with risk factors that confer a modest attributable risk to the individual.17 For example, most fragility fractures in the community arise among women with osteopenia (bone mineral density T score 2.5 to 1 SD) because they form the largest segment of the community.18 Likewise, most fractures attributable to nutritional inadequacy arise among the great many people with intakes of calcium and protein that are below recommended levels.19 This nutritional inadequacy confers a small attributable risk to the individual but accounts for a large attributable fraction of the fracture burden in the community as a whole. This is the Geoffrey Rose prevention paradoxa community based approach producing a small benefit to an individual may still confer a large benefit to the community.17 Safety is essential because most individuals treated may derive little or no benefit from the intervention. For example, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension study reduced blood pressure by replacing a western diet with a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, and low fat dairy foodsan approach associated with fewer cardiovascular events.20
Comparison with other studies
Most nutrition based studies assessing antifracture efficacy in aged care residents and people in the community used pharmacological doses of calcium with or without vitamin D.21 In a meta-analysis of 17 of these studies, only two studies reported a reduction in fracture riska study of nursing home residents with calcium intakes <600 mg/day and vitamin D concentrations <50 nmol/L and a community based study in women and men ?65 years of age with mean calcium intakes of 700 mg/day.21 In the remaining 15 studies, poor compliance, large numbers of dropouts, and a low prevalence of the risk factor may have contributed to the null findings.2223 Benefits are unlikely if the prevalence of a risk factor (such as inadequate calcium and protein intakes) is low.24 For example, in the meta-analysis, reduction in fracture risk reported with treatment was confined to the 7272 individuals with calcium intakes <700 mg/day (risk ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.89), not the 45 241 individuals with calcium intakes above 700 mg daily.21 The reduction in fracture risk observed with calcium and protein rich foods in this study may have been the result of attention to several of the above factors. Compliance was optimised by supervised provision and consumption of the foods. Participants lost to follow-up were replaced by newly admitted residents. We intentionally targeted a cohort at high risk for fracture in whom low calcium and protein intakes were common and so were likely to partly contribute to the already high fracture burden in this community.
Mechanisms of fracture risk reduction
This nutritional intervention produced two unanticipated novel observations. The risk reduction for falls and fractures was detected by three and five months, respectively, and the relative risk reduction for fractures was similar to that found in trials using potent antiresorptive therapy to treat people at high risk due to osteoporosis. The two most likely explanations for each of these observations is a risk reduction for falls and slowing progression of bone fragility. Insulin-like growth factor 1 increased in the intervention group only, whereas the decrease in appendicular lean mass was confined to controls, consistent with the notion that protein intakes of 1-1.5 g/kg/day is needed to prevent protein catabolism and preserve or increase muscle mass in older adults, particularly those at risk of malnutrition or frailty.25 The increase in serum C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and deterioration in tibial and radial total volumetric bone mineral density in controls was not seen in the intervention group, consistent with slowing of bone loss and slowing of microstructural deterioration.26 These changes were modest, but slowing microstructural deterioration disproportionately reduces progression of bone fragility because fragility increases as a power function to the bone loss producing it.27
Mortality did not differ between the groups. Some, but not all, studies suggest that milk consumption is associated with increased mortality but consumption of yoghurt and cheese (fermented foods) with reduced mortality and favourable blood lipid profiles.282930 Fermented and non-fermented dairy foods were used during the intervention. Milk consumption did not differ between the intervention and control groups (data not shown).
Limitations of study
The study has several limitations. Less than half of the participants had follow-up longer than 15 months. However, the reduction in risk of fractures and falls was detected within six months. Measures of dietary intakes and causes of secondary osteoporosis were obtained from the subgroup of 716 consented participants, not all 7195 residents, so compliance was monitored in about 10% of residents. However, recorded intakes of 55 000 foods and beverages are likely to be representative of all residents as most, if not all, food is provided by facilities. Assessment of body composition, bone morphology, and biochemistry was confined to a subgroup of residents. Attrition of these participants limited the power to examine differences in body composition, bone morphology, and biochemistry between the groups. Therefore, our ability to make inferences concerning the role of this intervention in slowing microstructural deterioration and loss of muscle mass is limited. Serum parathyroid hormone remained unchanged, perhaps owing to administration of around 1100 mg of calcium throughout the day as food, not as a single supplement of elemental calcium.31 Moreover, this intervention used whole dairy foods, so any potential benefit of other components of the dairy matrix cannot be determined.
Summary and conclusions
In summary, ageing of the population is associated with a greater number of older adults needing full time institutionalised care. These individuals are often malnourished.5 Although the risk of fracture attributable to undernutrition may be small in an individual, the large number of older adults in aged care confers a large fracture burden in the community; institutionalised people are the source of about 30% of all hip fractures.217 A high calcium and high protein nutritional intervention reduced the risk of falls and fractures. This intervention was tailored to the preferences of the residents and was successfully delivered through the food service using regular retail milk, yoghurt, and cheese incorporated into existing menus. In conclusion, this nutritional intervention has widespread implications as a public health measure for fracture prevention in the aged care setting and potentially in the wider community.

Abstract
Objective To assess the antifracture efficacy and safety of a nutritional intervention in institutionalised older adults replete in vitamin D but with mean intakes of 600 mg/day calcium and <1 g/kg body weight protein/day.
Design Two year cluster randomised controlled trial.
Setting 60 accredited residential aged care facilities in Australia housing predominantly ambulant residents.
Participants 7195 permanent residents (4920 (68%) female; mean age 86.0 (SD 8.2) years).
Intervention Facilities were stratified by location and organisation, with 30 facilities randomised to provide residents with additional milk, yoghurt, and cheese that contained 562 (166) mg/day calcium and 12 (6) g/day protein achieving a total intake of 1142 (353) mg calcium/day and 69 (15) g/day protein (1.1 g/kg body weight). The 30 control facilities maintained their usual menus, with residents consuming 700 (247) mg/day calcium and 58 (14) g/day protein (0.9 g/kg body weight).
Main outcome measures Group differences in incidence of fractures, falls, and all cause mortality.
Results Data from 27 intervention facilities and 29 control facilities were analysed. A total of 324 fractures (135 hip fractures), 4302 falls, and 1974 deaths were observed. The intervention was associated with risk reductions of 33% for all fractures (121 v 203; hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.93; P=0.02), 46% for hip fractures (42 v 93; 0.54, 0.35 to 0.83; P=0.005), and 11% for falls (1879 v 2423; 0.89, 0.78 to 0.98; P=0.04). The risk reduction for hip fractures and falls achieved significance at five months (P=0.02) and three months (P=0.004), respectively. Mortality was unchanged (900 v 1074; hazard ratio 1.01, 0.43 to 3.08).
Conclusions Improving calcium and protein intakes by using dairy foods is a readily accessible intervention that reduces the risk of falls and fractures commonly occurring in aged care residents.

Introduction
Longevity increases the proportion of older adults in the population. The accompanying increased prevalences of chronic illnesses, loss of musculoskeletal mass, frailty, and bone fragility increase the risk of falls and fractures.1 Loss of independence increases the number of people needing full time institutionalised care, the source of around 30% of all hip fractures in the community.2 Thus, targeting an intervention to all aged care residents is a rational approach to reducing the fracture burden in the whole community.
The widespread use of antiresorptive therapy is unlikely to reduce this fracture burden because of a paucity of evidence of antifracture efficacy in people over 80 years of age, the common occurrence of adverse events, and high cost given the large numbers of people that must be treated.3 However, these people often have calcium intakes below 700 mg daily, an amount unlikely to offset obligatory loss of calcium.4 They also often have protein intakes below 1 g/kg body weight/day, predisposing to loss of lean muscle mass.5 Thus, an alternative approach is to target all institutionalised older adults with a non-pharmaceutical nutritional intervention.
Few studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of a nutritional approach to reduction of fracture risk in aged care residents. Chapuy and colleagues showed antifracture efficacy with pharmacological doses of calcium and vitamin D in female nursing home residents with low calcium intakes and vitamin D deficiency.6 No studies have examined the effects of protein supplementation on reduction of fracture risk, despite evidence of improved muscle function and reduced falls.7
Consumption of milk, yoghurt, and cheese, foods rich in calcium and protein, slows bone loss and improves insulin-like growth factor 1.89 These foods are widely available, palatable, and low cost and so are likely to be adhered to. Accordingly, we conducted a prospective, two year, cluster randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that achieving recommended intakes of 1300 mg/day calcium and 1 g protein/kg body weight will reduce the risk of fragility fractures and falls when targeted to institutionalised older adults replete in vitamin D but with intakes below these levels.
Methods
Study design
This two year, cluster randomised controlled trial involved recruitment of 60 residential aged care facilities housing 7195 older adults in metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria, Australia, between December 2013 and August 2016. To ensure similar standards of care, we recruited only facilities accredited with the Australian Aged-Care Accreditation Agency that housed predominantly ambulant residents. These facilities are similar to residential care in the UK and assisted care facilities in the US. Facilities recruited were representative of charitable, private, and religious organisations, with an even distribution of small (?50 beds), medium (51-100 beds), and large (>100 beds) facilities (supplementary figure C). The ratio of women to men and the age of residents were representative of the national average.10
Inclusion criteria
Randomisation was by facility, not by individuals. For inclusion, facilities were required to provide no more than two servings of dairy foods daily, which was assessed from menu audits, as this level of provision is associated with dietary intakes of <1 g/kg body weight and 600 mg calcium daily.11 Vitamin D adequacy is maintained in residents through routine supplementation as foods are not fortified with vitamin D. We included only permanent residents in data analysesthat is, we excluded data from respite residents.
Randomisation procedure
The unit of randomisation was facility, as the intervention was delivered to all residents by the food service at each facility. Eligible facilities were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either intervention (n=30) or control (n=30), with the control facilities maintaining their existing menus. The randomisation was done with the use of a computer, with block sizes being varied according to organisation (to ensure similar procedures and policies), and was stratified by geographical location (to ensure similar socioeconomic status). A statistician independent of the study did the randomisation and provided the concealed group allocation to the principal investigator (SI) who, in turn, conveyed this allocation to the facility. SI was not involved in any data collection. An organisation may have between two and 10 facilities, and randomisation was done within an organisation.
Consent
Facility managers consented to provide de-identified details of age and sex of residents, as well as access to all incident reports including those for falls and fractures. Reporting of all incidents of any nature is a mandatory requirement of all accredited aged care providers. The accreditation agency regularly audits incident reports. Facilities are sanctioned if breaches are observed, with potential for accreditation to be revoked and government funding terminated. Falls (time, location, circumstances, and outcome/injury), fractures, and other adverse events were verified from these incident reports. These reports were maintained at all facilities. An independent medically trained person blinded to study allocation verified fractures by using hospital radiographs and radiographic reports. Residents and families were informed of the study during regular meetings. A subset of 371 residents from all facilities voluntarily consented to have dietary intake recorded, medical records reviewed, blood sampling, and measurement of body composition, bone mineral density, and bone microarchitecture performed. A next of kin consented for an additional 345 residents to allow dietary intake to be recorded and medical records reviewed.
Intervention
We classified dairy foods by using the Australian Dietary Guidelines, with a serving defined as 250 mL of milk, 200 g of yoghurt, and 40 g of cheese.12 Lactose-free options were provided to accommodate the few participants (<0.001%) with reported lactose intolerance. Butter, cream, and ice cream were not provided, as they contain little calcium or protein. All facilities prepared and cooked foods on site. We assigned intervention facilities a food service dietician to assist food service staff to increase the provision of dairy foods at all meals and snacks. Methods used to increase dairy foods included use of milk powder to fortify milk used in recipes and beverages. Dairy based desserts and snacks were offered in place of less nutritious foods such as cakes and biscuits. Foods provided were based on the preferences expressed by the residents at intervention sites.
Dairy foods were provided in-kind by Fonterra International (New Zealand) and distributed by a commercial food distribution company not associated with the project (Bidfoods, Australia). Use of a single distributor ensured accurate recording of costs for all dairy foods provided, with invoices used to verify compliance data. During dietary assessments, foods and beverages were weighed on a food scale (±1 g) (Sohnele Page Profi, Germany) at all facilities. During two days every three months, dieticians assessed compliance by using the validated visual estimation of plate waste, with data collected from 55 000 foods and beverages during the study.13 We used nutritional analysis software (FoodWorks, Australia) or the Australian food composition database NUTTAB 2010 to calculate nutrient intakes.
Data monitoring
Data safety monitoring was carried out by the Study Trial Review Board, which was provided with quarterly reports.
Outcomes
As per the approved study protocol, all pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes have been reported. The primary outcome was time to fragility fracture. Secondary outcomes were time to fall and changes in bone morphology and biochemistry. The tertiary outcomes of all cause mortality and changes in body composition are also reported. Exploratory outcomes including quality of life and muscle function were not examined (see original and final study protocols). Fasting morning serum samples were obtained from 189 residents at baseline and 12 months for measurement of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (baseline only), C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (a measure of bone resorption), procollagen type 1 N propeptide (a measure of bone formation), parathyroid hormone (Roche Cobas E170), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (LIASON) (supplementary figure A).
Body composition and bone morphology were assessed at baseline and 12 months in 72 residents (supplementary figure B). Total and appendicular (arms and legs) lean mass and fat mass were determined from total body scans, and bone mineral density was measured at the lumbar spine and femoral neck using dual x-ray absorptiometry (Prodigy, GE Lunar, Madison, WI, CV=1%). Volumetric bone mineral density (the amount of bone contained within the external volume of bone, in g/cm3) was measured at the distal tibia and distal radius by using high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (Scanco Medical AG, Switzerland, CV 0.54.0%).14 Cortical porosity was determined using automated image processing (StrAx1.0, Straxcorp, Melbourne, Australia).
Blinding and sample size
Once a facility was randomised, only the principal investigator, food service research dieticians, facility managers, and food service staff were aware of the allocation. Data acquisition and analyses were carried out by staff blinded to group allocation (SP, XW, MB, AGZ, and TN). Residents were blinded to the study; permission to conduct the study was obtained from the aged-care provider and facility managers. Some of the intervention strategies were not visiblefor example, fortification of milk with milk powder or modification of recipes. Some residents may have been aware of some changes, such as provision of cheese and biscuits for snacks, but not the reason for the changes.
The sample size was determined on the basis of a hypothesised effect size and intra-cluster correlation coefficient (r). Under the hypothesis that the intervention reduces the risk of fracture by 30%, based on previous antifracture calcium/vitamin D intervention in this setting, and that r ranges from 0.10 to 0.50, the sample size needed was 25 to 50 residents per facility and 25 facilities per arm to achieve the power of 80%.6 From falls data, we used an r of 0.20 to calculate the sample size.15 To account for approximately 20% annual attrition, we recruited 60 facilities with a minimum of 50 residents per facility.
At the start of the study, 3980 permanent residents were living in the participating facilities. We refer to these residents as the inception cohort. Recruitment continued throughout the 24 months to ensure that the required sample size was maintained, so we included data from residents admitted to facilities that replaced initial residents lost to follow-up due to death or discharge in analyses. We refer to these residents as the replacement cohort. In total, an additional 3215 residents were admitted to facilities after the study had started. We obtained details of new residents and those lost to follow-up from admission and discharge records from each facility.
Analyses
We expressed baseline data as mean and standard deviation, with the unit of analysis being clusters. We expressed fracture incidence, falls, and deaths per 100 person years of follow-up. We used the product limit (Kaplan-Meier) method to determine the cumulative risk of an event. No data were missing for these primary and secondary outcomes. The duration of follow-up was based on date of study entry to date of an event. When no event occurred, duration of follow-up was date of study entry to date of study termination.
As individuals were nested within clusters (facilities), the primary analysis was based on the mixed effects Coxs proportional hazards model; effects of intervention, age, and sex were fixed effects, and the facility was considered the random effect (see supplementary methods for additional statistical analysis). We expressed the results as a hazard ratio with 95% confidence limits. We used the coxme package to estimate model parameters. We also used the Fine-Gray sub-distribution method with the cmprsk package to do mortality competing risk analysis.
We tested between group differences in serum biomarkers and measurements of body composition and bone morphology at baseline with the weighted t test, with cluster being the unit of analysis. Biomarkers were log transformed if they were not normally distributed. We analysed effects of the intervention by using the mixed effects model in which the within person change in outcome was modelled as a function of treatment or control group, time of follow-up, age, weight, and sex. All analyses used the R Statistical Environment.
Amendments to protocol and statistical analysis plan
Initially, facilities were matched only by location to account for socioeconomic status. We also accounted for organisations, as they contributed varying numbers of facilities and had different policies and procedures. We included facilities providing less than two servings of dairy food daily, as dietary assessments for all residents was not feasible. We quantified two day instead of three day diets, as this was adequate to capture regular intakes.11 We did not assess osteocalcin, as sufficient information is obtained from C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and procollagen type 1 N propeptide. We used only all cause mortality as a tertiary outcome, as cardiovascular events were not obtainable and causes of death were poorly documented. We did not examine exploratory outcomes related to quality of life and muscle function, as unanticipated attrition reduced the sample size resulting in insufficient power to detect an effect of treatment. We did not include bayesian analyses and imputations, as no values were missing for falls and fracture outcomes (original and final study protocols).
Patient and public involvement
We consulted aged care residents, providers, and food service staff after the initial feasibility study that guided the design of this intervention.16 The manuscript was read by non-academics.
Results
Of the 60 facilities, 54 completed the 24 month intervention (fig 1). One control facility and three intervention facilities withdrew after randomisation. Two intervention facilities closed at months 15 and 20, but we included the data up to the date of closure. At baseline, the two groups had comparable demographics and were vitamin D replete. Daily baseline calcium and protein intakes were 689 (SD 266) mg and 57 (16) g respectively (table 1; supplementary figure D).
Nutritional changes
Dairy food intake increased from 2.0 to 3.5 servings daily in the intervention facilities (fig 2). The additional dairy foods, equivalent to 250 mL of milk plus 20 g cheese or 100 g yoghurt, provided 562 (166) mg calcium, achieving 1142 (353) mg calcium daily, and 12 (6) g protein, achieving an intake of 69 (15) g (1.1 g/kg body weight) daily. In control facilities, residents dairy intakes remained at less than two servings daily providing 700 (247) mg calcium and 58 (14) g protein (0.9 g/kg body weight) daily. No adverse gastrointestinal events related to the intervention were reported. No detectable within or between group differences in energy intake were observed during follow-up (fig 2). However, we observed group differences for the change in body weight (table 2). In absolute terms, no weight change occurred in the intervention group (0.3 (95% confidence interval ?0.8 to 1.4) kg; P=0.56). In controls, a weight loss of 1.4 (0.6 to 2.1) kg, (P<0.001) was due to a 0.3 (?0.6 to 0.0) kg decline in appendicular lean mass (P=0.03) and 0.8 kg (?1.6 to ?0.2) decline in total body fat mass (P=0.02).
Fractures, falls, and mortality
During 90 557 person months of follow-up (mean 12.6 (8.9) months), 324 fractures occurred: 121 (3.7%) in the intervention group and 203 (5.2%) in controlsa 33% risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.93; P=0.02). Post hoc analysis indicated that the incidence of hip fracture was 1.3% (n=42) in the intervention group and 2.4% (n=93) in controlsa 46% risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.54, 0.35 to 0.83; P=0.005). The separation in cumulative incidence of fractures between the groups achieved significance at five months for all fractures (P=0.02) and hip fractures (P=0.02) (fig 3). Competing risk analysis adjusted for mortality showed that the intervention was associated with average reductions in fracture risk of 27% (hazard ratio 0.73, 0.58 to 0.92) for all fractures and 44% (0.56, 0.39 to 0.82) for hip fractures.
The cumulative incidence of falls was 57% (n=1879) in the intervention group and 62% (n=2423) in controlsan 11% relative risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.89, 0.78 to 0.98; P=0.04). The separation in the incidence of falls between groups achieved significance at three months (P=0.04) (fig 3). All but one fracture was the result of a fall. Mortality did not differ between the intervention and control groups (27% (n=900) v 28% (n=1074), respectively; hazard ratio 1.01, 0.43 to 3.08; P=0.91) (fig 3). The numbers needing treatment to prevent any fracture, hip fracture, or a fall were 52, 82, and 17, respectively.
To explore the veracity of the observations made in the entire cohort (n=7195), we examined the effects of the intervention on fracture risk and falls relative to controls in a post hoc analyses of residents present at the start of the study (n=3980, the inception cohort) and residents added after its start (n=3215, the replacement cohort), separately. The inception cohort was older than the replacement cohort (mean 86.5 (8.1) v 85.2 (8.4) years; P<0.001). However, age did not differ between the intervention and control groups in either the inception cohort (mean 86.7 (8.2) v 86.4 (8.0) years, respectively; P=0.25) or the replacement cohort (85.1 (8.5) v 85.3 (8.2) years, respectively; P=0.601). We observed significant reductions in all fractures, hip fractures, and falls in the intervention group relative to the controls in both the inception and replacement cohorts (see supplementary figure E).
Biochemistry and bone morphology
The subgroup providing data for biochemistry, body composition, and bone morphology did not differ from the entire cohort in age (mean 85.9 (8.2) v 85.6 (8.2) years), proportion of women to men (70% (n=74) v 69% (n=57)), and proportion with previous fractures (38% (n=40) v 39 (n=32)). As shown in table 2, at 12 months, we observed a 20.4% between group difference in serum C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (P=0.002), the result of no change in the intervention group and a 13.1% increase in controls (P<0.05). We observed no between group difference in procollagen type 1 N propeptide or parathyroid hormone, but we observed a 7.9% between group difference in serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (P=0.04), the result of a 5.9% increase in the intervention group (P<0.05) and no change in controls.
We observed a 1.8% between group difference in spine bone mineral density (P=0.04), the result of a 2.1% increase in the intervention group (P<0.001) and no change in controls. The 1.7% between group difference in femoral neck bone mineral density was not significant (P=0.09). The 3.3% between group difference in distal radius total volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.02) and 2.0% between group difference in distal tibial total volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.07) were the result of decreases at each site in controls (both P<0.05). We observed a 4.6% between group difference in distal radial trabecular volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.03) due to a non-significant decrease in controls and a 0.7% increase in distal tibia cortical porosity in controls (P<0.05).
Discussion
This nutritional approach using high calcium and high protein dairy foods to increase calcium and protein intakes in institutionalised older adults replete in vitamin D was associated with a 33% reduction in risk of fractures of any type, a 46% reduction in risk of hip fractures, and an 11% reduction in risk of falls relative to controls. We found no group difference in all cause mortality.
Most interventions aimed at reducing fracture risk target a drug therapy to people with osteoporosis because they are at high risk of fracture. This approach confers a large benefit to the individual and does so cost effectively, because few people need to be treated to avert one event. However, averting fractures in small numbers of people at high risk does not reduce the burden of fractures in the community.
The population burden of fracturesthe number of events, morbidity, mortality, and cost to the communityarises from the vast numbers of people with risk factors that confer a modest attributable risk to the individual.17 For example, most fragility fractures in the community arise among women with osteopenia (bone mineral density T score 2.5 to 1 SD) because they form the largest segment of the community.18 Likewise, most fractures attributable to nutritional inadequacy arise among the great many people with intakes of calcium and protein that are below recommended levels.19 This nutritional inadequacy confers a small attributable risk to the individual but accounts for a large attributable fraction of the fracture burden in the community as a whole. This is the Geoffrey Rose prevention paradoxa community based approach producing a small benefit to an individual may still confer a large benefit to the community.17 Safety is essential because most individuals treated may derive little or no benefit from the intervention. For example, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension study reduced blood pressure by replacing a western diet with a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, and low fat dairy foodsan approach associated with fewer cardiovascular events.20
Comparison with other studies
Most nutrition based studies assessing antifracture efficacy in aged care residents and people in the community used pharmacological doses of calcium with or without vitamin D.21 In a meta-analysis of 17 of these studies, only two studies reported a reduction in fracture riska study of nursing home residents with calcium intakes <600 mg/day and vitamin D concentrations <50 nmol/L and a community based study in women and men ?65 years of age with mean calcium intakes of 700 mg/day.21 In the remaining 15 studies, poor compliance, large numbers of dropouts, and a low prevalence of the risk factor may have contributed to the null findings.2223 Benefits are unlikely if the prevalence of a risk factor (such as inadequate calcium and protein intakes) is low.24 For example, in the meta-analysis, reduction in fracture risk reported with treatment was confined to the 7272 individuals with calcium intakes <700 mg/day (risk ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.89), not the 45 241 individuals with calcium intakes above 700 mg daily.21 The reduction in fracture risk observed with calcium and protein rich foods in this study may have been the result of attention to several of the above factors. Compliance was optimised by supervised provision and consumption of the foods. Participants lost to follow-up were replaced by newly admitted residents. We intentionally targeted a cohort at high risk for fracture in whom low calcium and protein intakes were common and so were likely to partly contribute to the already high fracture burden in this community.
Mechanisms of fracture risk reduction
This nutritional intervention produced two unanticipated novel observations. The risk reduction for falls and fractures was detected by three and five months, respectively, and the relative risk reduction for fractures was similar to that found in trials using potent antiresorptive therapy to treat people at high risk due to osteoporosis. The two most likely explanations for each of these observations is a risk reduction for falls and slowing progression of bone fragility. Insulin-like growth factor 1 increased in the intervention group only, whereas the decrease in appendicular lean mass was confined to controls, consistent with the notion that protein intakes of 1-1.5 g/kg/day is needed to prevent protein catabolism and preserve or increase muscle mass in older adults, particularly those at risk of malnutrition or frailty.25 The increase in serum C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and deterioration in tibial and radial total volumetric bone mineral density in controls was not seen in the intervention group, consistent with slowing of bone loss and slowing of microstructural deterioration.26 These changes were modest, but slowing microstructural deterioration disproportionately reduces progression of bone fragility because fragility increases as a power function to the bone loss producing it.27
Mortality did not differ between the groups. Some, but not all, studies suggest that milk consumption is associated with increased mortality but consumption of yoghurt and cheese (fermented foods) with reduced mortality and favourable blood lipid profiles.282930 Fermented and non-fermented dairy foods were used during the intervention. Milk consumption did not differ between the intervention and control groups (data not shown).
Limitations of study
The study has several limitations. Less than half of the participants had follow-up longer than 15 months. However, the reduction in risk of fractures and falls was detected within six months. Measures of dietary intakes and causes of secondary osteoporosis were obtained from the subgroup of 716 consented participants, not all 7195 residents, so compliance was monitored in about 10% of residents. However, recorded intakes of 55 000 foods and beverages are likely to be representative of all residents as most, if not all, food is provided by facilities. Assessment of body composition, bone morphology, and biochemistry was confined to a subgroup of residents. Attrition of these participants limited the power to examine differences in body composition, bone morphology, and biochemistry between the groups. Therefore, our ability to make inferences concerning the role of this intervention in slowing microstructural deterioration and loss of muscle mass is limited. Serum parathyroid hormone remained unchanged, perhaps owing to administration of around 1100 mg of calcium throughout the day as food, not as a single supplement of elemental calcium.31 Moreover, this intervention used whole dairy foods, so any potential benefit of other components of the dairy matrix cannot be determined.
Summary and conclusions
In summary, ageing of the population is associated with a greater number of older adults needing full time institutionalised care. These individuals are often malnourished.5 Although the risk of fracture attributable to undernutrition may be small in an individual, the large number of older adults in aged care confers a large fracture burden in the community; institutionalised people are the source of about 30% of all hip fractures.217 A high calcium and high protein nutritional intervention reduced the risk of falls and fractures. This intervention was tailored to the preferences of the residents and was successfully delivered through the food service using regular retail milk, yoghurt, and cheese incorporated into existing menus. In conclusion, this nutritional intervention has widespread implications as a public health measure for fracture prevention in the aged care setting and potentially in the wider community.

A two-year cluster randomized controlled trial conducted in Australia found that increasing calcium and protein intake through dairy foods reduced the risk of falls and fractures in older adults in residential care. The study involved 7195 permanent residents with a mean age of 86.0 years. The intervention group received additional milk, yogurt, and cheese, resulting in a total intake of 1142 mg/day calcium and 69 g/day protein. The control group maintained their usual menus, with intakes of 700 mg/day calcium and 58 g/day protein. The intervention was associated with a 33% reduction in all fractures, a 46% reduction in hip fractures, and an 11% reduction in falls. The risk reduction for hip fractures and falls achieved significance within three to five months. There was no difference in all-cause mortality between the groups. These findings suggest that improving calcium and protein intakes through dairy foods is an accessible intervention that can reduce the risk of falls and fractures in aged care residents.

Abstract
Objective To assess the antifracture efficacy and safety of a nutritional intervention in institutionalised older adults replete in vitamin D but with mean intakes of 600 mg/day calcium and <1 g/kg body weight protein/day.
Design Two year cluster randomised controlled trial.
Setting 60 accredited residential aged care facilities in Australia housing predominantly ambulant residents.
Participants 7195 permanent residents (4920 (68%) female; mean age 86.0 (SD 8.2) years).
Intervention Facilities were stratified by location and organisation, with 30 facilities randomised to provide residents with additional milk, yoghurt, and cheese that contained 562 (166) mg/day calcium and 12 (6) g/day protein achieving a total intake of 1142 (353) mg calcium/day and 69 (15) g/day protein (1.1 g/kg body weight). The 30 control facilities maintained their usual menus, with residents consuming 700 (247) mg/day calcium and 58 (14) g/day protein (0.9 g/kg body weight).
Main outcome measures Group differences in incidence of fractures, falls, and all cause mortality.
Results Data from 27 intervention facilities and 29 control facilities were analysed. A total of 324 fractures (135 hip fractures), 4302 falls, and 1974 deaths were observed. The intervention was associated with risk reductions of 33% for all fractures (121 v 203; hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.93; P=0.02), 46% for hip fractures (42 v 93; 0.54, 0.35 to 0.83; P=0.005), and 11% for falls (1879 v 2423; 0.89, 0.78 to 0.98; P=0.04). The risk reduction for hip fractures and falls achieved significance at five months (P=0.02) and three months (P=0.004), respectively. Mortality was unchanged (900 v 1074; hazard ratio 1.01, 0.43 to 3.08).
Conclusions Improving calcium and protein intakes by using dairy foods is a readily accessible intervention that reduces the risk of falls and fractures commonly occurring in aged care residents.

Introduction
Longevity increases the proportion of older adults in the population. The accompanying increased prevalences of chronic illnesses, loss of musculoskeletal mass, frailty, and bone fragility increase the risk of falls and fractures.1 Loss of independence increases the number of people needing full time institutionalised care, the source of around 30% of all hip fractures in the community.2 Thus, targeting an intervention to all aged care residents is a rational approach to reducing the fracture burden in the whole community.
The widespread use of antiresorptive therapy is unlikely to reduce this fracture burden because of a paucity of evidence of antifracture efficacy in people over 80 years of age, the common occurrence of adverse events, and high cost given the large numbers of people that must be treated.3 However, these people often have calcium intakes below 700 mg daily, an amount unlikely to offset obligatory loss of calcium.4 They also often have protein intakes below 1 g/kg body weight/day, predisposing to loss of lean muscle mass.5 Thus, an alternative approach is to target all institutionalised older adults with a non-pharmaceutical nutritional intervention.
Few studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of a nutritional approach to reduction of fracture risk in aged care residents. Chapuy and colleagues showed antifracture efficacy with pharmacological doses of calcium and vitamin D in female nursing home residents with low calcium intakes and vitamin D deficiency.6 No studies have examined the effects of protein supplementation on reduction of fracture risk, despite evidence of improved muscle function and reduced falls.7
Consumption of milk, yoghurt, and cheese, foods rich in calcium and protein, slows bone loss and improves insulin-like growth factor 1.89 These foods are widely available, palatable, and low cost and so are likely to be adhered to. Accordingly, we conducted a prospective, two year, cluster randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that achieving recommended intakes of 1300 mg/day calcium and 1 g protein/kg body weight will reduce the risk of fragility fractures and falls when targeted to institutionalised older adults replete in vitamin D but with intakes below these levels.
Methods
Study design
This two year, cluster randomised controlled trial involved recruitment of 60 residential aged care facilities housing 7195 older adults in metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria, Australia, between December 2013 and August 2016. To ensure similar standards of care, we recruited only facilities accredited with the Australian Aged-Care Accreditation Agency that housed predominantly ambulant residents. These facilities are similar to residential care in the UK and assisted care facilities in the US. Facilities recruited were representative of charitable, private, and religious organisations, with an even distribution of small (?50 beds), medium (51-100 beds), and large (>100 beds) facilities (supplementary figure C). The ratio of women to men and the age of residents were representative of the national average.10
Inclusion criteria
Randomisation was by facility, not by individuals. For inclusion, facilities were required to provide no more than two servings of dairy foods daily, which was assessed from menu audits, as this level of provision is associated with dietary intakes of <1 g/kg body weight and 600 mg calcium daily.11 Vitamin D adequacy is maintained in residents through routine supplementation as foods are not fortified with vitamin D. We included only permanent residents in data analysesthat is, we excluded data from respite residents.
Randomisation procedure
The unit of randomisation was facility, as the intervention was delivered to all residents by the food service at each facility. Eligible facilities were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either intervention (n=30) or control (n=30), with the control facilities maintaining their existing menus. The randomisation was done with the use of a computer, with block sizes being varied according to organisation (to ensure similar procedures and policies), and was stratified by geographical location (to ensure similar socioeconomic status). A statistician independent of the study did the randomisation and provided the concealed group allocation to the principal investigator (SI) who, in turn, conveyed this allocation to the facility. SI was not involved in any data collection. An organisation may have between two and 10 facilities, and randomisation was done within an organisation.
Consent
Facility managers consented to provide de-identified details of age and sex of residents, as well as access to all incident reports including those for falls and fractures. Reporting of all incidents of any nature is a mandatory requirement of all accredited aged care providers. The accreditation agency regularly audits incident reports. Facilities are sanctioned if breaches are observed, with potential for accreditation to be revoked and government funding terminated. Falls (time, location, circumstances, and outcome/injury), fractures, and other adverse events were verified from these incident reports. These reports were maintained at all facilities. An independent medically trained person blinded to study allocation verified fractures by using hospital radiographs and radiographic reports. Residents and families were informed of the study during regular meetings. A subset of 371 residents from all facilities voluntarily consented to have dietary intake recorded, medical records reviewed, blood sampling, and measurement of body composition, bone mineral density, and bone microarchitecture performed. A next of kin consented for an additional 345 residents to allow dietary intake to be recorded and medical records reviewed.
Intervention
We classified dairy foods by using the Australian Dietary Guidelines, with a serving defined as 250 mL of milk, 200 g of yoghurt, and 40 g of cheese.12 Lactose-free options were provided to accommodate the few participants (<0.001%) with reported lactose intolerance. Butter, cream, and ice cream were not provided, as they contain little calcium or protein. All facilities prepared and cooked foods on site. We assigned intervention facilities a food service dietician to assist food service staff to increase the provision of dairy foods at all meals and snacks. Methods used to increase dairy foods included use of milk powder to fortify milk used in recipes and beverages. Dairy based desserts and snacks were offered in place of less nutritious foods such as cakes and biscuits. Foods provided were based on the preferences expressed by the residents at intervention sites.
Dairy foods were provided in-kind by Fonterra International (New Zealand) and distributed by a commercial food distribution company not associated with the project (Bidfoods, Australia). Use of a single distributor ensured accurate recording of costs for all dairy foods provided, with invoices used to verify compliance data. During dietary assessments, foods and beverages were weighed on a food scale (±1 g) (Sohnele Page Profi, Germany) at all facilities. During two days every three months, dieticians assessed compliance by using the validated visual estimation of plate waste, with data collected from 55 000 foods and beverages during the study.13 We used nutritional analysis software (FoodWorks, Australia) or the Australian food composition database NUTTAB 2010 to calculate nutrient intakes.
Data monitoring
Data safety monitoring was carried out by the Study Trial Review Board, which was provided with quarterly reports.
Outcomes
As per the approved study protocol, all pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes have been reported. The primary outcome was time to fragility fracture. Secondary outcomes were time to fall and changes in bone morphology and biochemistry. The tertiary outcomes of all cause mortality and changes in body composition are also reported. Exploratory outcomes including quality of life and muscle function were not examined (see original and final study protocols). Fasting morning serum samples were obtained from 189 residents at baseline and 12 months for measurement of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (baseline only), C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (a measure of bone resorption), procollagen type 1 N propeptide (a measure of bone formation), parathyroid hormone (Roche Cobas E170), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (LIASON) (supplementary figure A).
Body composition and bone morphology were assessed at baseline and 12 months in 72 residents (supplementary figure B). Total and appendicular (arms and legs) lean mass and fat mass were determined from total body scans, and bone mineral density was measured at the lumbar spine and femoral neck using dual x-ray absorptiometry (Prodigy, GE Lunar, Madison, WI, CV=1%). Volumetric bone mineral density (the amount of bone contained within the external volume of bone, in g/cm3) was measured at the distal tibia and distal radius by using high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (Scanco Medical AG, Switzerland, CV 0.54.0%).14 Cortical porosity was determined using automated image processing (StrAx1.0, Straxcorp, Melbourne, Australia).
Blinding and sample size
Once a facility was randomised, only the principal investigator, food service research dieticians, facility managers, and food service staff were aware of the allocation. Data acquisition and analyses were carried out by staff blinded to group allocation (SP, XW, MB, AGZ, and TN). Residents were blinded to the study; permission to conduct the study was obtained from the aged-care provider and facility managers. Some of the intervention strategies were not visiblefor example, fortification of milk with milk powder or modification of recipes. Some residents may have been aware of some changes, such as provision of cheese and biscuits for snacks, but not the reason for the changes.
The sample size was determined on the basis of a hypothesised effect size and intra-cluster correlation coefficient (r). Under the hypothesis that the intervention reduces the risk of fracture by 30%, based on previous antifracture calcium/vitamin D intervention in this setting, and that r ranges from 0.10 to 0.50, the sample size needed was 25 to 50 residents per facility and 25 facilities per arm to achieve the power of 80%.6 From falls data, we used an r of 0.20 to calculate the sample size.15 To account for approximately 20% annual attrition, we recruited 60 facilities with a minimum of 50 residents per facility.
At the start of the study, 3980 permanent residents were living in the participating facilities. We refer to these residents as the inception cohort. Recruitment continued throughout the 24 months to ensure that the required sample size was maintained, so we included data from residents admitted to facilities that replaced initial residents lost to follow-up due to death or discharge in analyses. We refer to these residents as the replacement cohort. In total, an additional 3215 residents were admitted to facilities after the study had started. We obtained details of new residents and those lost to follow-up from admission and discharge records from each facility.
Analyses
We expressed baseline data as mean and standard deviation, with the unit of analysis being clusters. We expressed fracture incidence, falls, and deaths per 100 person years of follow-up. We used the product limit (Kaplan-Meier) method to determine the cumulative risk of an event. No data were missing for these primary and secondary outcomes. The duration of follow-up was based on date of study entry to date of an event. When no event occurred, duration of follow-up was date of study entry to date of study termination.
As individuals were nested within clusters (facilities), the primary analysis was based on the mixed effects Coxs proportional hazards model; effects of intervention, age, and sex were fixed effects, and the facility was considered the random effect (see supplementary methods for additional statistical analysis). We expressed the results as a hazard ratio with 95% confidence limits. We used the coxme package to estimate model parameters. We also used the Fine-Gray sub-distribution method with the cmprsk package to do mortality competing risk analysis.
We tested between group differences in serum biomarkers and measurements of body composition and bone morphology at baseline with the weighted t test, with cluster being the unit of analysis. Biomarkers were log transformed if they were not normally distributed. We analysed effects of the intervention by using the mixed effects model in which the within person change in outcome was modelled as a function of treatment or control group, time of follow-up, age, weight, and sex. All analyses used the R Statistical Environment.
Amendments to protocol and statistical analysis plan
Initially, facilities were matched only by location to account for socioeconomic status. We also accounted for organisations, as they contributed varying numbers of facilities and had different policies and procedures. We included facilities providing less than two servings of dairy food daily, as dietary assessments for all residents was not feasible. We quantified two day instead of three day diets, as this was adequate to capture regular intakes.11 We did not assess osteocalcin, as sufficient information is obtained from C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and procollagen type 1 N propeptide. We used only all cause mortality as a tertiary outcome, as cardiovascular events were not obtainable and causes of death were poorly documented. We did not examine exploratory outcomes related to quality of life and muscle function, as unanticipated attrition reduced the sample size resulting in insufficient power to detect an effect of treatment. We did not include bayesian analyses and imputations, as no values were missing for falls and fracture outcomes (original and final study protocols).
Patient and public involvement
We consulted aged care residents, providers, and food service staff after the initial feasibility study that guided the design of this intervention.16 The manuscript was read by non-academics.
Results
Of the 60 facilities, 54 completed the 24 month intervention (fig 1). One control facility and three intervention facilities withdrew after randomisation. Two intervention facilities closed at months 15 and 20, but we included the data up to the date of closure. At baseline, the two groups had comparable demographics and were vitamin D replete. Daily baseline calcium and protein intakes were 689 (SD 266) mg and 57 (16) g respectively (table 1; supplementary figure D).
Nutritional changes
Dairy food intake increased from 2.0 to 3.5 servings daily in the intervention facilities (fig 2). The additional dairy foods, equivalent to 250 mL of milk plus 20 g cheese or 100 g yoghurt, provided 562 (166) mg calcium, achieving 1142 (353) mg calcium daily, and 12 (6) g protein, achieving an intake of 69 (15) g (1.1 g/kg body weight) daily. In control facilities, residents dairy intakes remained at less than two servings daily providing 700 (247) mg calcium and 58 (14) g protein (0.9 g/kg body weight) daily. No adverse gastrointestinal events related to the intervention were reported. No detectable within or between group differences in energy intake were observed during follow-up (fig 2). However, we observed group differences for the change in body weight (table 2). In absolute terms, no weight change occurred in the intervention group (0.3 (95% confidence interval ?0.8 to 1.4) kg; P=0.56). In controls, a weight loss of 1.4 (0.6 to 2.1) kg, (P<0.001) was due to a 0.3 (?0.6 to 0.0) kg decline in appendicular lean mass (P=0.03) and 0.8 kg (?1.6 to ?0.2) decline in total body fat mass (P=0.02).
Fractures, falls, and mortality
During 90 557 person months of follow-up (mean 12.6 (8.9) months), 324 fractures occurred: 121 (3.7%) in the intervention group and 203 (5.2%) in controlsa 33% risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.93; P=0.02). Post hoc analysis indicated that the incidence of hip fracture was 1.3% (n=42) in the intervention group and 2.4% (n=93) in controlsa 46% risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.54, 0.35 to 0.83; P=0.005). The separation in cumulative incidence of fractures between the groups achieved significance at five months for all fractures (P=0.02) and hip fractures (P=0.02) (fig 3). Competing risk analysis adjusted for mortality showed that the intervention was associated with average reductions in fracture risk of 27% (hazard ratio 0.73, 0.58 to 0.92) for all fractures and 44% (0.56, 0.39 to 0.82) for hip fractures.
The cumulative incidence of falls was 57% (n=1879) in the intervention group and 62% (n=2423) in controlsan 11% relative risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.89, 0.78 to 0.98; P=0.04). The separation in the incidence of falls between groups achieved significance at three months (P=0.04) (fig 3). All but one fracture was the result of a fall. Mortality did not differ between the intervention and control groups (27% (n=900) v 28% (n=1074), respectively; hazard ratio 1.01, 0.43 to 3.08; P=0.91) (fig 3). The numbers needing treatment to prevent any fracture, hip fracture, or a fall were 52, 82, and 17, respectively.
To explore the veracity of the observations made in the entire cohort (n=7195), we examined the effects of the intervention on fracture risk and falls relative to controls in a post hoc analyses of residents present at the start of the study (n=3980, the inception cohort) and residents added after its start (n=3215, the replacement cohort), separately. The inception cohort was older than the replacement cohort (mean 86.5 (8.1) v 85.2 (8.4) years; P<0.001). However, age did not differ between the intervention and control groups in either the inception cohort (mean 86.7 (8.2) v 86.4 (8.0) years, respectively; P=0.25) or the replacement cohort (85.1 (8.5) v 85.3 (8.2) years, respectively; P=0.601). We observed significant reductions in all fractures, hip fractures, and falls in the intervention group relative to the controls in both the inception and replacement cohorts (see supplementary figure E).
Biochemistry and bone morphology
The subgroup providing data for biochemistry, body composition, and bone morphology did not differ from the entire cohort in age (mean 85.9 (8.2) v 85.6 (8.2) years), proportion of women to men (70% (n=74) v 69% (n=57)), and proportion with previous fractures (38% (n=40) v 39 (n=32)). As shown in table 2, at 12 months, we observed a 20.4% between group difference in serum C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (P=0.002), the result of no change in the intervention group and a 13.1% increase in controls (P<0.05). We observed no between group difference in procollagen type 1 N propeptide or parathyroid hormone, but we observed a 7.9% between group difference in serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (P=0.04), the result of a 5.9% increase in the intervention group (P<0.05) and no change in controls.
We observed a 1.8% between group difference in spine bone mineral density (P=0.04), the result of a 2.1% increase in the intervention group (P<0.001) and no change in controls. The 1.7% between group difference in femoral neck bone mineral density was not significant (P=0.09). The 3.3% between group difference in distal radius total volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.02) and 2.0% between group difference in distal tibial total volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.07) were the result of decreases at each site in controls (both P<0.05). We observed a 4.6% between group difference in distal radial trabecular volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.03) due to a non-significant decrease in controls and a 0.7% increase in distal tibia cortical porosity in controls (P<0.05).
Discussion
This nutritional approach using high calcium and high protein dairy foods to increase calcium and protein intakes in institutionalised older adults replete in vitamin D was associated with a 33% reduction in risk of fractures of any type, a 46% reduction in risk of hip fractures, and an 11% reduction in risk of falls relative to controls. We found no group difference in all cause mortality.
Most interventions aimed at reducing fracture risk target a drug therapy to people with osteoporosis because they are at high risk of fracture. This approach confers a large benefit to the individual and does so cost effectively, because few people need to be treated to avert one event. However, averting fractures in small numbers of people at high risk does not reduce the burden of fractures in the community.
The population burden of fracturesthe number of events, morbidity, mortality, and cost to the communityarises from the vast numbers of people with risk factors that confer a modest attributable risk to the individual.17 For example, most fragility fractures in the community arise among women with osteopenia (bone mineral density T score 2.5 to 1 SD) because they form the largest segment of the community.18 Likewise, most fractures attributable to nutritional inadequacy arise among the great many people with intakes of calcium and protein that are below recommended levels.19 This nutritional inadequacy confers a small attributable risk to the individual but accounts for a large attributable fraction of the fracture burden in the community as a whole. This is the Geoffrey Rose prevention paradoxa community based approach producing a small benefit to an individual may still confer a large benefit to the community.17 Safety is essential because most individuals treated may derive little or no benefit from the intervention. For example, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension study reduced blood pressure by replacing a western diet with a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, and low fat dairy foodsan approach associated with fewer cardiovascular events.20
Comparison with other studies
Most nutrition based studies assessing antifracture efficacy in aged care residents and people in the community used pharmacological doses of calcium with or without vitamin D.21 In a meta-analysis of 17 of these studies, only two studies reported a reduction in fracture riska study of nursing home residents with calcium intakes <600 mg/day and vitamin D concentrations <50 nmol/L and a community based study in women and men ?65 years of age with mean calcium intakes of 700 mg/day.21 In the remaining 15 studies, poor compliance, large numbers of dropouts, and a low prevalence of the risk factor may have contributed to the null findings.2223 Benefits are unlikely if the prevalence of a risk factor (such as inadequate calcium and protein intakes) is low.24 For example, in the meta-analysis, reduction in fracture risk reported with treatment was confined to the 7272 individuals with calcium intakes <700 mg/day (risk ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.89), not the 45 241 individuals with calcium intakes above 700 mg daily.21 The reduction in fracture risk observed with calcium and protein rich foods in this study may have been the result of attention to several of the above factors. Compliance was optimised by supervised provision and consumption of the foods. Participants lost to follow-up were replaced by newly admitted residents. We intentionally targeted a cohort at high risk for fracture in whom low calcium and protein intakes were common and so were likely to partly contribute to the already high fracture burden in this community.
Mechanisms of fracture risk reduction
This nutritional intervention produced two unanticipated novel observations. The risk reduction for falls and fractures was detected by three and five months, respectively, and the relative risk reduction for fractures was similar to that found in trials using potent antiresorptive therapy to treat people at high risk due to osteoporosis. The two most likely explanations for each of these observations is a risk reduction for falls and slowing progression of bone fragility. Insulin-like growth factor 1 increased in the intervention group only, whereas the decrease in appendicular lean mass was confined to controls, consistent with the notion that protein intakes of 1-1.5 g/kg/day is needed to prevent protein catabolism and preserve or increase muscle mass in older adults, particularly those at risk of malnutrition or frailty.25 The increase in serum C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and deterioration in tibial and radial total volumetric bone mineral density in controls was not seen in the intervention group, consistent with slowing of bone loss and slowing of microstructural deterioration.26 These changes were modest, but slowing microstructural deterioration disproportionately reduces progression of bone fragility because fragility increases as a power function to the bone loss producing it.27
Mortality did not differ between the groups. Some, but not all, studies suggest that milk consumption is associated with increased mortality but consumption of yoghurt and cheese (fermented foods) with reduced mortality and favourable blood lipid profiles.282930 Fermented and non-fermented dairy foods were used during the intervention. Milk consumption did not differ between the intervention and control groups (data not shown).
Limitations of study
The study has several limitations. Less than half of the participants had follow-up longer than 15 months. However, the reduction in risk of fractures and falls was detected within six months. Measures of dietary intakes and causes of secondary osteoporosis were obtained from the subgroup of 716 consented participants, not all 7195 residents, so compliance was monitored in about 10% of residents. However, recorded intakes of 55 000 foods and beverages are likely to be representative of all residents as most, if not all, food is provided by facilities. Assessment of body composition, bone morphology, and biochemistry was confined to a subgroup of residents. Attrition of these participants limited the power to examine differences in body composition, bone morphology, and biochemistry between the groups. Therefore, our ability to make inferences concerning the role of this intervention in slowing microstructural deterioration and loss of muscle mass is limited. Serum parathyroid hormone remained unchanged, perhaps owing to administration of around 1100 mg of calcium throughout the day as food, not as a single supplement of elemental calcium.31 Moreover, this intervention used whole dairy foods, so any potential benefit of other components of the dairy matrix cannot be determined.
Summary and conclusions
In summary, ageing of the population is associated with a greater number of older adults needing full time institutionalised care. These individuals are often malnourished.5 Although the risk of fracture attributable to undernutrition may be small in an individual, the large number of older adults in aged care confers a large fracture burden in the community; institutionalised people are the source of about 30% of all hip fractures.217 A high calcium and high protein nutritional intervention reduced the risk of falls and fractures. This intervention was tailored to the preferences of the residents and was successfully delivered through the food service using regular retail milk, yoghurt, and cheese incorporated into existing menus. In conclusion, this nutritional intervention has widespread implications as a public health measure for fracture prevention in the aged care setting and potentially in the wider community.

Chronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17?-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a womans pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34?±?46 s; P = 0.02, ?2p
 = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7?±?0.7 cm; P = 0.004; ?2p
 = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7?±?0.9 cm; P = 0.02; ?2p
 = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3?±?0.9 cm; P < 0.001, ?2p
 = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.

NEW & NOTEWORTHY Whether hypohydration can increase pain in women remains untested. Menstrual phase may influence pain, but findings are equivocal and may be confounded by the lack of hydration measures. We found that pain sensitivity in women increased after 24 h of fluid restriction versus ad libitum fluid intake, but did not differ between menstrual phases. Water ingestion did not acutely attenuate the negative effects of hypohydration on pain, highlighting the importance of staying well-hydrated throughout the day.

INTRODUCTION
Pain is recognized as a public health problem (1). Chronic pain [i.e., pain that persists for ?3 mo (2)] in particular, affects ?20% of the global population (3, 4), with negative consequences to the individual, society, healthcare, and the economy. In the United States, the annual cost of chronic pain is estimated to be $635 millionmore than that of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes combined (5). However, chronic pain treatment has proven difficult due to the complex and multifactorial nature of pain (6). In a survey conducted across several European countries, 40% of chronic pain sufferers reported feeling dissatisfied with the effectiveness of their pain treatment(s) (4). Hence, more research on the mechanisms and factors contributing to a persons pain experience is needed. Given the various complexities of studying chronic pain (e.g., ethical, logistical, and medical considerations), such research is usually performed by administering various acute experimental pain stimuli to healthy individuals.

Recent studies have shown that hypohydration can increase experimental pain sensitivity (7, 8). Mild hypohydration of <1% body mass loss, induced by prior fasting and exercise, was found to decrease pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) during a cold pressor task in men, compared with when they were rehydrated (7). These findings were supported in a later study, where subjective ratings of cold pressor pain in men were higher after 24 h of fluid restriction (1.4% body mass loss) than in the euhydrated condition (8). Similarly, a field study showed that hypohydrated cyclists perceived more intense pain in their leg muscles during an ultra-endurance race, compared with the euhydrated cyclists (9). However, these studies were primarily performed in men and the effects of hypohydration on pain in women have not been formally investigated.

Several chronic pain conditions are more prevalent among women than men (10). Women also tend to display greater sensitivity to various experimental pain stimuli (11). Furthermore, pain perception in women may be influenced by hormonal fluctuations (primarily 17?-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle (12, 13). It is generally agreed that the severity of pain symptoms in several chronic pain conditions varies across the menstrual cycle (13, 14); however, whether the menstrual phase affects experimental pain sensitivity in healthy, pain-free women is still contestable (15, 16). The lack of accurate verification of menstrual phases and presence of various potential confounders (e.g., dysmenorrhea, dietary, and lifestyle factors) in many studies could explain the inconsistent findings (15). Some studies have attempted to address these issues (e.g., see Refs. 17 and 18), but such studies are scant and did not appear to impose a progesterone threshold to ensure only ovulatory cycles were included (19). Notably, none of the previous studies measured hydration status of participants at the time of testing, which may be influenced by menstrual phase (20, 21).

The ovarian hormones affect body fluid regulatory mechanisms (22), with potential implications for hydration status (20, 21). The mid-luteal phase (high 17?-estradiol and progesterone) is associated with an earlier release of arginine vasopressin (AVP)a fluid-regulatory hormone that increases renal water retentionand thirst during exercise-induced dehydration or hypertonic saline infusion, compared with the early follicular phase (low 17?-estradiol and progesterone) (23, 24). This may potentially reduce the severity of dehydration for a given hydration challenge in the mid-luteal phase (20, 21). In the context of pain, this may suggest: 1) differences in the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration in the early follicular compared with mid-luteal phase, 2) potential variability in hydration status across the menstrual cycle may have confounded previous research on effects of the menstrual phase and experimental pain sensitivity, and 3) hypohydration may reduce the efficacy of pain treatments in women (21).

Importantly, mild hypohydration appears to be common among women, with data from the United States showing approximately half of the 7,855 surveyed women meeting the hypohydration criterion (plasma tonicity > 295 mmol·L?1) (25). Therefore, the current study investigated the effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in women. We also examined whether the negative consequences of hypohydration on pain could be remedied by acute water ingestion. We hypothesized that 1) hypohydration would increase experimental pain sensitivity in women, 2) the magnitude of this increase in pain sensitivity would differ between the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases, and 3) acute water ingestion would reverse the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration.

METHODS
Ethical Approval
The study was approved by the Massey University Human Ethics Committee: Southern A (18/66). The study conformed to the requirements of the US Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (45 CFR, Part 46), and the standards set by the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki, except for registration in a database. All participants provided written, informed consent before all trials. Researchers were not blinded to the experimental conditions and analyses.

Participants
Twenty-three healthy, eumenorrheic women initially volunteered for this study. As this is the first study, to our knowledge, that has investigated the effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase in combination, there was no reference study to base our sample size calculations on. As such, sample size was estimated from two previous studies; one on hypohydration and pain (? = 0.79 and effect size = 0.53) (8) and the other on a meta-analysis on menstrual phase effects on pain (effect size = 0.5 for ischemic pain, ? = 0.80) (12), which yielded required sample sizes of n = 17 and n = 27, respectively at an ? = 0.05. Therefore, we aimed for 17 > n < 27 and estimated the required number of participants for sufficient power to be n = 22.

Six participants did not proceed with the experimental trials due to scheduling difficulties; thus, 17 women completed all experimental trials [means (SD): age, 28 (8) yr; height, 1.63 (0.07) m; body mass, 65.0 (10.8) kg]. Participants reported having regular menstrual cycles (i.e., 2135 days) at the time of recruitment and had not used hormonal contraceptives within the past 6 mo. All participants were nonsmokers, had no pre-existing or history of medical, psychiatric, pain-related, or menstrual-related disorders (e.g., dysmenorrhea, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and premenstrual syndrome), and were not taking any medications. Taking into consideration these inclusion/exclusion criteria, women aged > 18 < 50 yr were recruited. All participants, except for one, were recreationally physically active, engaging in at least 150 min of structured exercise per week.

Experimental Overview
Participants attended the laboratory on six occasions: two familiarization sessions, followed by four experimental trials. The four experimental trials were a full crossover of menstrual phase (EF and ML) and hydration status [euhydrated (EUH) and hypohydrated (HYPO)] and were performed over one or two menstrual cycles. The order of the experimental trials was randomized and counterbalanced, but the order of EUH and HYPO for each participant was maintained in the different menstrual phases. The experimental trials for each participant began at the same time of day (±1 h) to minimize diurnal variation in pain sensitivity (26) and ovarian hormone concentrations (27). All trials were separated by at least 48 h and were performed under standard environmental conditions (22°C, 50% relative humidity, room illuminance of 600 lx).

Familiarization
Before the experimental trials, participants were familiarized with the ischemic pain test (see Ischemic Pain Test) on two separate occasions to minimize potential learning and anxiety effects. The first familiarization session also included measurement of participants height and body mass (for calculation of fluid volume), and assessment of their maximal handgrip strength (see Maximal Handgrip Strength Assessment) to determine the absolute intensity for the submaximal contractions during the ischemic pain test. The number of familiarization sessions was determined from preliminary assessment of the time course of the learning effects, where pain outcome measures appeared to plateau after two sessions.

Maximal Handgrip Strength Assessment
Using their nondominant hand, participants performed three maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) with a handgrip dynamometer (MLT003 Grip Force Transducer, ADInstruments Inc., CO) (28). Participants were asked to squeeze the dynamometer maximally for 5 s during each MVC, separated by 1 min of rest. Force output from the dynamometer was recorded (PowerLab, ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand) and displayed in real-time (LabChart Pro, ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand). Maximal handgrip strength was determined by calculating the mean of the peak values for the three MVCs. This assessment was only conducted once during the first familiarization session, rather than at the start of each experimental trial, to prevent potential effects of the MVCs on subsequent pain sensitivity (28). Furthermore, maximal handgrip strength does not appear to be affected by menstrual phase (19, 29) or hypohydration (30, 31).

Dietary and Lifestyle Control
Participants refrained from pain-relieving medications, alcohol, and strenuous exercise at least 12 h before the start of each experimental trial. Participants also maintained their habitual caffeine intake over this 24-h period to minimize confounding effects of caffeine on pain sensitivity (32) and psychological variables (33, 34). To prevent caffeine withdrawal during the hypohydrated trials, participants who normally consumed caffeinated beverages were given a caffeine tablet (No-Doz Awakeners, Novartis Consumer Health, Inc.) to take in place of the beverages. Participants recorded their diet, physical activity, and time to bed and wake (i.e., sleep duration) during the 24-h period before their first trial and were asked to replicate these for subsequent trials. Participants completed a dietary and lifestyle record sheet at the start of each trial to assess adherence to these instructions.

Menstrual Cycle Phase and Hydration Intervention
Participants were tested during the EF and ML phases of their menstrual cycle to maximize the phase difference in ovarian hormone concentrations. The EF trials took place on days 4 (1) and 6 (2) and the ML trials on days 20 (2) and 22 (2), with day 1 representing start of menses and assuming a conventional 28-day menstrual cycle. Testing was scheduled using the three-step method (35) whereby self-reported menses onset and urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) testing (EasyCheck Ovulation Test, Phoenix Medcare, Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand) prospectively identified EF and ML, whereas measurement of serum 17?-estradiol and progesterone retrospectively confirmed ML. The EF phase was further verified by 17?-estradiol concentrations that were lower than in ML. Participants started daily LH testing 16 days before the end of a typical cycle until a positive LH test result was obtained (confirmed visually by the researchers), with ML trials then scheduled six to ten days after the positive LH test. To ensure ovulation had occurred and to minimize the likelihood of including anovulatory or luteal phase-deficient cycles, participants with progesterone < 5 ng·mL?1 were excluded from the final analyses (19, 36).

Twenty-four hours before each trial, participants were instructed to either restrict fluid intake and avoid consumption of high-water content foods (>50%, e.g., soups, vegetables, and fruits) (HYPO), or to drink ad libitum (EUH). Participants recorded their food and fluid intake over this 24-h period retrospectively at the start of each trial (see Dietary and Lifestyle Control and Experimental Protocol).

Experimental Protocol
Upon the participants arrival at the laboratory, a blood sample was obtained from the antecubital vein of the dominant arm via venepuncture. Participants then provided a urine sample and had their body mass measured. Urine specific gravity (USG) was measured immediately to confirm euhydration (USG < 1.020) or hypohydration (USG ? 1.020) (37). Participants then completed the dietary and lifestyle record sheet, Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (EUH only; see Measurements) and thirst ratings, followed by the ischemic pain test.

Immediately after the pain test, participants ingested a glass of water (5 mL·kg?1 of body mass measured during the first familiarization) and finished it within 5 min. This volume of water was previously shown to produce an immediate decrease in thirst perception in hypohydrated men (38). A 30-min break followed, during which participants remained in the laboratory and performed their activity of choice (e.g., reading and watching videos) that was consistent for all trials. After the break, participants repeated the thirst ratings and ischemic pain test. The duration of the break was determined based on previous data that examined the reliability of pressure pain measurements taken before and after 30 min of rest (39). Pain thresholds at both time points were not different; however, pain ratings decreased after the 30-min break in women, but not in men. Although this suggests that more than 30 min may be required to ameliorate carryover effects, especially in women, we decided on 30 min to prevent boredom and restlessness since participants had to remain in the laboratory during this period.

Ischemic Pain Test
The ischemic pain test consisted of the Submaximal Effort Tourniquet Procedure (40). This experimental pain stimulus was chosen as it is more clinically relevant than other pain stimuli (e.g., noxious heat, mechanical pressure, and electrical stimulation) (41). A pneumatic cuff was positioned on the participants nondominant arm, just above the elbow joint. The participants arm was passively raised to a vertical position for 30 s to promote venous drainage. The pneumatic cuff was then inflated to 250 mmHg and a stopwatch was started. The participants arm was immediately lowered to a horizontal position on the table, such that the forearm rests on the table with the elbow joint at a 90° angle. To promote forearm ischemia, participants performed 25 handgrip exercises at 30% of their predetermined maximum handgrip strength (see Familiarization). Each contraction was sustained for 2 s and followed by 2 s of rest. Auditory signals indicated the start and end of each contraction. Participants received continuous visual feedback of their force output and the target force on a laptop screen.

Upon completion of the handgrip exercises, the cuff remained inflated on the participants arm and participants watched a nature documentary to standardize their attention throughout the remainder of the pain test. The volume of the video was maintained at 30% for all trials. One minute after the end of the handgrip exercises, participants rated their pain intensity and unpleasantness on a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) (42). Participants were asked to indicate verbally when they were no longer able or willing to endure the pain (pain tolerance). The stopwatch was then stopped; just before the cuff was deflated, participants rated their pain intensity and unpleasantness again, to verify that they had reached pain tolerance. Unknown to participants, a maximum time limit of 20 min was enforced for the pain test.

Measurements
Anthropometric.
Participants height and body mass were measured using a stadiometer (Seca, Hamburg, Germany; accurate to 0.1 cm) and electronic scale (Model X3M, HIWEIGH Technologies Limited, Shanghai, China; accurate to 10 g), respectively.

Ovarian hormone concentrations.
Venous blood was collected into two 10 mL vacutainer tubes (Becton-Dickson, Oxford, UK). One tube contained clot activator for analysis of serum osmolality (Sosm), 17?-estradiol, and progesterone concentrations, whereas the other tube contained K3EDTA for analysis of plasma copeptin. The tube containing clot activator was inverted gently and left to clot for a minimum of 30 min at room temperature. The whole blood in both tubes was then centrifuged (Centrifuge 5804 R, Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) at 4°C and 260 g for 15 min to separate serum and plasma from whole blood. Aliquots of serum and plasma were then separated into three Eppendorf tubes (Genuine Axygen Quality) each and stored at ?80°C for further analysis. Commercially available enzyme-linked immune assays were used to measure concentrations of 17?-estradiol (Demeditec Diagnostics, Kiel, Germany) and progesterone (IBL International, Hamburg, Germany) in serum samples, with a sensitivity of 6.2 pg·mL?1 and 0.045 ng·mL?1, respectively, and an intra-assay variation of <6% and <7%, respectively. The ratio of progesterone to 17?-estradiol (P4:E2 ratio) was then calculated (43).

Hydration status.
Hydration status was assessed by measurement of Sosm, plasma copeptin concentrations, USG, ratings of thirst perception, and percent body mass change. Serum osmolality was measured via freezing-point depression (Digimatic osmometer Model 3D2, Advanced Instruments, Inc., Norwood, MA). Measurements were made in duplicate and averaged. If the two measurements differed by more than 5%, a third measurement was taken and the average of the two closest values was calculated. Plasma copeptin concentrations, a surrogate marker for AVP (44, 45), were measured with an automated immunofluorescent Copeptin proAVP KRYPTOR assay (B·R·A·H·M·S KRYPTOR compact PLUS analyzer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Henningsdorf, Germany), with a sensitivity of 1.08 pmol·L?1. Urine specific gravity was measured using a handheld clinical refractometer (Clinical Refractometer MASTER-SUR/NM, Atago Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Thirst perception was measured using pen and paper with a 10-cm VAS (46). Percent body mass change in HYPO was calculated from the EUH body mass within the same menstrual phase.

Psychological variables.
Depressive symptomatology was assessed using the CES-D (47). Given the 1-wk response timeframe of the CES-D, it was only administered once in each menstrual phase during the EUH trial.

Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software for Windows (IBM SPSS Statistics 20, NY). Descriptive values are reported as means (SD), unless otherwise stated. Data were assessed to ensure they were normally distributed and for sphericity, with no corrections needed. Data for Sosm, plasma copeptin, USG, body mass, 17?-estradiol, progesterone, and the P4:E2 ratio were assessed using a two-way (Phase × Hydration) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). For thirst ratings, pain tolerance and pain intensity, and unpleasantness ratings, the data were analyzed by three-way (Phase × Hydration × Water) repeated-measures ANOVA. When main or interaction effects occurred for the two- or three-way ANOVA, post hoc pair-wise analyses were conducted using paired-samples t tests with Bonferroni correction, where appropriate. Data for CES-D and percent body mass change were analyzed using a paired-samples t test to compare means between menstrual phases. Bivariate Pearsons correlations were performed to examine the direction and strength of relationships between the main independent (i.e., hydration markers and ovarian hormone concentrations) and dependent (i.e., ischemic pain measures) variables measured at baseline (i.e., before water ingestion). All pairwise data were included in the correlation analyses to maximize statistical power. Effect sizes are reported as partial eta-squared (?2p
) with demarcations of small (<0.06), medium (>0.06 and <0.14), and large (>0.14) effects, respectively (48). An a priori alpha of ? = 0.05 was used to demarcate statistically significant effects.

RESULTS
Following analysis of ovarian hormone concentrations, three participants did not meet the progesterone threshold of >5 ng·mL?1 and were excluded from subsequent analyses. Therefore, the following results are reported for the remaining 14 participants.

Self-Reported Sleep Duration and Depressive Symptomatology
Mean sleep duration across trials was 7.4 (1.6) h, which was not different between hydration conditions or menstrual phases (all P ? 0.15, ?2p
 ? 0.15). Incomplete data were collected for CES-D scores (n = 13). CES-D scores were not different between menstrual phases [EF: 10 (7) vs. ML: 12 (6); P = 0.55, ?2p
?=?0.03].

Ovarian Hormone Concentrations
Because of the difficulty in obtaining blood samples in one or more trials for three participants, incomplete data were obtained for serum 17?-estradiol and progesterone concentrations (n = 11 each). Both progesterone [by 25.8 (25.9) vs. 0.5 (0.2) ng·mL?1; P = 0.009, ?2p
?=?0.51] and 17?-estradiol [by 106 (58) vs. 52 (27) pg·mL?1; P = 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.66] concentrations were higher in the ML compared with EF phase but were not dependent on hydration status (Phase × Hydration: all P ? 0.46; ?2p
 ? 0.06) (Table 1). Accordingly, the P4:E2 ratio was also higher in the ML compared with EF phase (P = 0.005, ?2p
?=?0.57) independent of hydration status (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.78; ?2p
?=?0.01). Progesterone, 17?-estradiol, and the P4:E2 ratio were all unaffected by hydration status (all P ? 0.46, ?2p
 ? 0.06).

Hydration Status
Biochemical markers of hydration status obtained at baseline (i.e., before water ingestion) indicate that 24 h of fluid restriction was successful in eliciting mild dehydration (Table 2). Absolute body mass was lower in HYPO than in EUH (P = 0.006, ?2p
?=?0.45) but this was not dependent on menstrual phase (Phase × hydration: P = 0.31, ?2p
?=?0.08). Therefore, average percent change in body mass from EUH to HYPO was 0.9% (1.3).

Because of the difficulty in obtaining blood samples, incomplete data were collected for Sosm (n = 10) and plasma copeptin (n = 9). Sosm was higher during HYPO than EUH (P = 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.72) and was higher in EF than in ML (P = 0.03, ?2p
?=?0.43), but these effects were not dependent on menstrual phase or hydration status, respectively (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.22, ?2p
?=?0.17). Both plasma copeptin (P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.44) and USG (P < 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.84) were also higher in HYPO than in EUH, but these were not dependent on menstrual phase (Phase × hydration: both P ? 0.40, ?2p
 ? 0.09). In accordance with the significantly higher values of these biochemical markers, baseline thirst ratings were also higher during HYPO than in EUH (P < 0.001; ?2p
?=?0.89), independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.67, ?2p
?=?0.02).

Thirst Perception Ratings
Incomplete data were collected for thirst perception ratings (n = 13). Overall, thirst was higher during HYPO than EUH [by 3.2 (1.2) cm; P < 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.89] and was higher in ML than in EF [by 0.4 (0.6) cm; P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.30], but these effects were not dependent on menstrual phase or hydration status, respectively (Phase × hydration: P = 0.67, ?2p
?=?0.02). Thirst ratings decreased after water ingestion (from baseline) by a larger extent during HYPO than in EUH [? 4.0 (2.3) vs. ? 0.6 (1.4) cm; Hydration × Water: P < 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.65], independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration × Water: P = 0.47, ?
2
p
?=?0.05).
Ischemic Pain Tolerance
One participant was able to tolerate the ischemic pain for the maximum time limit of 20 min (1,200 s) in one trial (EUH trial in the ML phase) (Fig. 1). Her pain tolerance in this trial was therefore recorded as 1,200 s. Pain tolerance was lower during HYPO than in EUH [by 34 (46) s; P = 0.02, ?2p
?=?0.37), independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.15, ?2p
?=?0.15) or acute water ingestion (Hydration × Water: P = 0.92; ?2p
?=?0.001). Pain tolerance was unaffected by menstrual phase or acute water ingestion (both P ? 0.43, ?2p
 ? 0.05).

Ischemic Pain Intensity and Unpleasantness Ratings
Incomplete data were collected for pain intensity (Fig. 2) and unpleasantness (Fig. 3) at 1 min after handgrip exercise (n = 12 each) because two participants had terminated the pain test before this time point. Both pain intensity [6.6 (1.3) vs. 5.9 (1.4) cm; P = 0.004, ?2p
?=?0.55)] and pain unpleasantness [7.1 (1.3) vs. 6.4 (1.5) cm; P = 0.02, ?2p
?=?0.40] ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise were higher during HYPO than in EUH, independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration: both P ? 0.15, ?2p
 ? 0.18). Both pain intensity (P = 0.004, ?2p
?=?0.54) and pain unpleasantness (P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.34) ratings increased after water ingestion (from baseline), independently of hydration status (Hydration × Water: both P ? 0.50, ?2p
 ? 0.04) or menstrual phase (Phase × Water: both P ? 0.53, ?2p
 ? 0.04).

At pain tolerance, however, both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness ratings were not different between hydration conditions or menstrual phases (all P ? 0.13, ?2p
 ? 0.17). After water ingestion, pain intensity ratings increased by 3.4 (0.6) cm from baseline (P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.29) but pain unpleasantness was unaffected [+0.2 (4.6) cm; P = 0.10, ?2p
?=?0.20], independent of hydration status (Hydration × Water: both P ? 0.11, ?2p
 ? 0.19) or menstrual phase (Phase × Water: both P ? 0.55, ?2p
 ? 0.03).

Correlations
Serum concentrations of 17?-estradiol were negatively correlated with pain tolerance (r = ?0.31, P = 0.02) and positively correlated with pain unpleasantness ratings (r = 0.34, P = 0.02), but were not significantly associated with pain intensity ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (r = 0.23, P = 0.13). However, it should be noted that the strength of the significant correlations observed was weak (48) and therefore should be interpreted with caution. Neither progesterone nor the P4:E2 ratio was significantly associated with any of the ischemic pain measures (all r ? ?0.20, P ? 0.17). Similarly, no significant correlations were found between any of the hydration variables and ischemic pain measures (all r ? 0.20 and P ? 0.17).

DISCUSSION
This study examined the independent and combined effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in healthy eumenorrheic women, and the potential efficacy of acute water ingestion as a remedy to the deleterious impact of hypohydration. The main findings were that: 1) mild hypohydration increased pain sensitivity, 2) menstrual phase did not affect pain sensitivity, nor did it influence the effect of hypohydration on pain, and 3) acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity.

Hypohydration and Pain in Women
Independent of menstrual phase, mild hypohydration following 24 h of fluid restriction reduced pain tolerance (?8%) and increased pain intensity (+13%) and pain unpleasantness (+12%) ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (hereafter referred to as pain ratings) during ischemic pain stimulation, when compared with euhydration. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies that showed negative effects of mild hypohydration on experimental pain sensitivity in men (7, 8). Ogino et al. (7) observed a decrease in pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) following a combination of exercise-induced dehydration and fluid restriction, whereas Bear et al. (8) found an increase in pain intensity ratings but no difference in pain thresholds after 24 h of fluid restriction. Therefore, the current findings extend these previous results to women by showing that mild hypohydration also increases experimental pain sensitivity in women. The previous studies also did not include pain measures that reflect the affective/emotional experience of pain (i.e., pain tolerance or pain unpleasantness ratings) that may be important for chronic pain, whereas both pain threshold and pain intensity ratings assess the sensory/discriminative aspect of pain (49, 50). Although Bear et al. (8) measured pain tolerance, the nature of the stimulus-response relationship for the cold pressor taski.e., plateau and gradual decline in the perceived intensity of the pain stimulus (41)resulted in a large proportion (?2/3) of participants who were able to tolerate the pain until the 4-min cut-off time, thereby precluding meaningful analyses of the results. This issue was not apparent with the ischemic pain test used in the present study, as there was only one instance where the 20-min time limit was reached. Therefore, the current findings further add to the previous data by showing that mild hypohydration also negatively impacts the affective/emotional aspect of pain, as evidenced by the decrease in pain tolerance and increase in pain unpleasantness ratings compared with EUH.

The exact mechanisms underlying the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration cannot be determined from the current data. However, one potential mechanism through which hypohydration may increase pain sensitivity is thirst perception. Geuter et al. (51) showed that an increase in thirst perceptioninduced by consumption of salty snacks followed by 5 h of fluid deprivationled to an increase in pain intensity ratings during noxious heat stimulation, whereas subsequent ad libitum fluid intake, which reduced thirst perception, decreased pain ratings. In another study, stimulation of thirst sensation via hypertonic saline infusion increased pain intensity ratings during noxious pressure stimulation, which were associated with stronger activation of pain-related brain regions; namely, the anterior cingulate cortex and insula (52). Similar findings were reported in the study by Ogino et al. (7). These brain regions were previously shown to be activated and deactivated independently by an increase and decrease in thirst perception, respectively (5254). However, it is not apparent from these data whether the increased pain sensitivity and pain-related brain activity were due to thirst perception per se, physiological hypohydration, or both.

Menstrual Phase and Experimental Pain Sensitivity
Menstrual phase did not modulate the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration, nor did it independently affect pain sensitivity. The lack of a menstrual phase effect on ischemic pain sensitivity is consistent with the findings of most previous studies that examined ischemic pain responses across the menstrual cycle (18, 5558). In contrast, studies by Fillingim et al. (59) and Pfleeger et al. (60) observed greater pain sensitivity during the luteal compared with follicular phase. However, concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone were not measured in the study by Pfleeger et al. (60), whereas the specific definition of the luteal phase used by Fillingim et al. (59) differed from that in the current study. We examined the ML phase when concentrations of both 17?-estradiol and progesterone are elevated, whereas Fillingim et al. (59) included the late-luteal period in their classification of the luteal phase, during which concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone are declining rapidly and are less stable compared with the ML phase. Given that menstrual phases characterized by fluctuating or unstable 17?-estradiol levels have been associated with increased severity of various chronic pain conditions (14), this may explain why Fillingim et al. (59) observed phase differences in pain sensitivity whereas we did not.

The equivocal and inconclusive results regarding menstrual phase effects on experimental pain sensitivity are thought to be due, in part, to the lack of proper verification of menstrual phases through blood measurements of 17?-estradiol and progesterone (15, 16), making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relationship between menstrual phase/hormone status and pain sensitivity. Similar to previous observations (22, 23), Sosm was lower in the ML than EF phase (Table 2); however, this phase difference in hydration did not appear to impact any of the ischemic pain measures (Figs. 13). In this study, we showed that after hydration status was controlled, menstrual phases were properly verified and potential confounders (e.g., dietary and lifestyle factors and dysmenorrhea) were minimized, there was no difference in ischemic pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases. As such, our data suggest that the hormonal fluctuations within the menstrual cycle do not greatly impact pain sensitivity.

Interestingly, although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phase, there was a positive correlation between 17?-estradiol and pain sensitivity, suggesting that women with higher baseline levels of 17?-estradiol may be more sensitive to pain than those with lower 17?-estradiol levels (i.e., between-subject effect). However, given the weak strength of the correlation (r = ?0.32) (48), this finding should be interpreted with caution.

Effects of Acute Water Ingestion
Given that thirst perception may be a potential mechanism linking hypohydration and increased pain sensitivity, we hypothesized that acute water ingestion when hypohydrated would reduce pain sensitivity. This would also help to delineate the effects of thirst and hypohydration per se, on pain, since acute water ingestion would be expected to reduce thirst without altering hydration status (38, 61). However, contrary to our hypothesis, ischemic pain tolerance was not affected by ingestion of 5 mL·kg?1 of water, despite the significant decrease in thirst perception ratings. Meanwhile, ratings of both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness increased, which may appear counterintuitive as participants reported feeling more pain despite being less thirsty. These unexpected findings may be explained by carryover (sensitization) effects from the baseline pain test. A previous study showed that repeated pain stimulation within a single session produced a sensitization effect, whereby pain ratings increased gradually with each repeated stimulation (62). Therefore, this sensitization effect may have masked potential positive effects of acute water ingestion on pain. Future studies that either utilize a longer interval between the repeated pain tests, or perform the postwater ingestion pain test on a separate day, are required to gain further understanding on the relative importance of thirst perception and physiological hypohydration on pain.

Considerations
There are several considerations and limitations of this study that should be noted in addition to those already discussed earlier. First, only healthy, eumenorrheic women were included in this study, which ignores postmenopausal women and oral contraceptive pill users, who have different hormonal profiles compared with eumenorrheic women. Therefore, it is possible that hypohydration may affect pain sensitivity differently in these women compared with eumenorrheic women. Second, blood samples were not obtained after water ingestion to confirm that hydration status was not altered. However, previous data indicate that consuming a moderate volume of water, similar to that in the current study, does not acutely alter hydration status in hypohydrated men (38, 61). In addition, the relatively short interval of 30 min between water ingestion and the subsequent pain test was likely insufficient for hydration status to be altered, because a previous study showed that at least 75 min is required for 300 mL of water to be completely absorbed into the bloodstream (63). Third, as participants could not be blinded to the hydration intervention, the increased pain sensitivity observed during HYPO may have been confounded by nocebo effects (64, 65). Although participants were not aware of the study hypotheses, they were aware of the aims of the study, one of which was to investigate the effects of hypohydration on pain sensitivity. Given the negative connotations of hypohydration or dehydration, it is conceivable that participants would expect hypohydration to increase pain sensitivity, which may have subsequently influenced participants actual responses to the ischemic pain test. Fourth, the body mass change values in HYPO may not accurately reflect the fluid losses induced by the 24 h of fluid restriction. Due to the scheduling constraints that included two experimental visits within 3 days per menstrual phase, we were unable to obtain a baseline body mass at the start of the hydration intervention; thus, body mass change in HYPO was calculated using EUH body mass. As the EUH and HYPO trials within each menstrual phase were separated by at least 48 h, it is likely that the values were confounded by factors other than the change in body water content (e.g., urine and fecal losses, food and fluid consumption). Acknowledging this limitation, we obtained other measures of hydration status (i.e., Sosm, USG, copeptin, and thirst ratings) in addition to body mass change for a more accurate assessment of hydrations status. Finally, our sample size may have limited our ability to detect statistically significant menstrual phase effects on pain. As such, the effects of menstrual phase on pain require further investigation. Our study could provide a reference for future studies with a similar design to base their sample size calculations on. Nevertheless, large effect sizes (?2p
 = 0.370.55) were obtained for the main effect of hypohydration on pain, with an observed power of 0.70.9, which suggests a low probability of false negatives.

Perspectives and Significance
Our data indicate that hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women and this effect may not be reversed immediately by water ingestion. Whereas, menstrual phase (EF vs. ML) does not appear to affect pain sensitivity. These findings suggest that insufficient water intake throughout the day may exacerbate pain perception in healthy women. Given the high prevalence of hypohydration among the general population (25), future studies should investigate whether hypohydration may worsen chronic pain conditions, and the potential efficacy of maintaining adequate hydration in alleviating pain symptoms. This may be especially important for older adults, who are more likely to be hypohydrated and experience chronic pain (25, 66). For human pain researchers, controlling or measuring hydration status of participants may be important to minimize confound, as clinically and physiologically relevant tests such as the cold pressor are affected (67). Although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases after controlling for hydration status, more high-quality research is required to accurately determine whether menstrual phase does or does not affect pain sensitivity. Therefore, until a consensus on the topic has been reached, our data do not discount the need for future pain researchers to verify menstrual phase.

Chronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17?-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a womans pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34?±?46 s; P = 0.02, ?2p
 = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7?±?0.7 cm; P = 0.004; ?2p
 = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7?±?0.9 cm; P = 0.02; ?2p
 = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3?±?0.9 cm; P < 0.001, ?2p
 = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.

NEW & NOTEWORTHY Whether hypohydration can increase pain in women remains untested. Menstrual phase may influence pain, but findings are equivocal and may be confounded by the lack of hydration measures. We found that pain sensitivity in women increased after 24 h of fluid restriction versus ad libitum fluid intake, but did not differ between menstrual phases. Water ingestion did not acutely attenuate the negative effects of hypohydration on pain, highlighting the importance of staying well-hydrated throughout the day.

INTRODUCTION
Pain is recognized as a public health problem (1). Chronic pain [i.e., pain that persists for ?3 mo (2)] in particular, affects ?20% of the global population (3, 4), with negative consequences to the individual, society, healthcare, and the economy. In the United States, the annual cost of chronic pain is estimated to be $635 millionmore than that of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes combined (5). However, chronic pain treatment has proven difficult due to the complex and multifactorial nature of pain (6). In a survey conducted across several European countries, 40% of chronic pain sufferers reported feeling dissatisfied with the effectiveness of their pain treatment(s) (4). Hence, more research on the mechanisms and factors contributing to a persons pain experience is needed. Given the various complexities of studying chronic pain (e.g., ethical, logistical, and medical considerations), such research is usually performed by administering various acute experimental pain stimuli to healthy individuals.

Recent studies have shown that hypohydration can increase experimental pain sensitivity (7, 8). Mild hypohydration of <1% body mass loss, induced by prior fasting and exercise, was found to decrease pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) during a cold pressor task in men, compared with when they were rehydrated (7). These findings were supported in a later study, where subjective ratings of cold pressor pain in men were higher after 24 h of fluid restriction (1.4% body mass loss) than in the euhydrated condition (8). Similarly, a field study showed that hypohydrated cyclists perceived more intense pain in their leg muscles during an ultra-endurance race, compared with the euhydrated cyclists (9). However, these studies were primarily performed in men and the effects of hypohydration on pain in women have not been formally investigated.

Several chronic pain conditions are more prevalent among women than men (10). Women also tend to display greater sensitivity to various experimental pain stimuli (11). Furthermore, pain perception in women may be influenced by hormonal fluctuations (primarily 17?-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle (12, 13). It is generally agreed that the severity of pain symptoms in several chronic pain conditions varies across the menstrual cycle (13, 14); however, whether the menstrual phase affects experimental pain sensitivity in healthy, pain-free women is still contestable (15, 16). The lack of accurate verification of menstrual phases and presence of various potential confounders (e.g., dysmenorrhea, dietary, and lifestyle factors) in many studies could explain the inconsistent findings (15). Some studies have attempted to address these issues (e.g., see Refs. 17 and 18), but such studies are scant and did not appear to impose a progesterone threshold to ensure only ovulatory cycles were included (19). Notably, none of the previous studies measured hydration status of participants at the time of testing, which may be influenced by menstrual phase (20, 21).

The ovarian hormones affect body fluid regulatory mechanisms (22), with potential implications for hydration status (20, 21). The mid-luteal phase (high 17?-estradiol and progesterone) is associated with an earlier release of arginine vasopressin (AVP)a fluid-regulatory hormone that increases renal water retentionand thirst during exercise-induced dehydration or hypertonic saline infusion, compared with the early follicular phase (low 17?-estradiol and progesterone) (23, 24). This may potentially reduce the severity of dehydration for a given hydration challenge in the mid-luteal phase (20, 21). In the context of pain, this may suggest: 1) differences in the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration in the early follicular compared with mid-luteal phase, 2) potential variability in hydration status across the menstrual cycle may have confounded previous research on effects of the menstrual phase and experimental pain sensitivity, and 3) hypohydration may reduce the efficacy of pain treatments in women (21).

Importantly, mild hypohydration appears to be common among women, with data from the United States showing approximately half of the 7,855 surveyed women meeting the hypohydration criterion (plasma tonicity > 295 mmol·L?1) (25). Therefore, the current study investigated the effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in women. We also examined whether the negative consequences of hypohydration on pain could be remedied by acute water ingestion. We hypothesized that 1) hypohydration would increase experimental pain sensitivity in women, 2) the magnitude of this increase in pain sensitivity would differ between the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases, and 3) acute water ingestion would reverse the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration.

METHODS
Ethical Approval
The study was approved by the Massey University Human Ethics Committee: Southern A (18/66). The study conformed to the requirements of the US Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (45 CFR, Part 46), and the standards set by the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki, except for registration in a database. All participants provided written, informed consent before all trials. Researchers were not blinded to the experimental conditions and analyses.

Participants
Twenty-three healthy, eumenorrheic women initially volunteered for this study. As this is the first study, to our knowledge, that has investigated the effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase in combination, there was no reference study to base our sample size calculations on. As such, sample size was estimated from two previous studies; one on hypohydration and pain (? = 0.79 and effect size = 0.53) (8) and the other on a meta-analysis on menstrual phase effects on pain (effect size = 0.5 for ischemic pain, ? = 0.80) (12), which yielded required sample sizes of n = 17 and n = 27, respectively at an ? = 0.05. Therefore, we aimed for 17 > n < 27 and estimated the required number of participants for sufficient power to be n = 22.

Six participants did not proceed with the experimental trials due to scheduling difficulties; thus, 17 women completed all experimental trials [means (SD): age, 28 (8) yr; height, 1.63 (0.07) m; body mass, 65.0 (10.8) kg]. Participants reported having regular menstrual cycles (i.e., 2135 days) at the time of recruitment and had not used hormonal contraceptives within the past 6 mo. All participants were nonsmokers, had no pre-existing or history of medical, psychiatric, pain-related, or menstrual-related disorders (e.g., dysmenorrhea, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and premenstrual syndrome), and were not taking any medications. Taking into consideration these inclusion/exclusion criteria, women aged > 18 < 50 yr were recruited. All participants, except for one, were recreationally physically active, engaging in at least 150 min of structured exercise per week.

Experimental Overview
Participants attended the laboratory on six occasions: two familiarization sessions, followed by four experimental trials. The four experimental trials were a full crossover of menstrual phase (EF and ML) and hydration status [euhydrated (EUH) and hypohydrated (HYPO)] and were performed over one or two menstrual cycles. The order of the experimental trials was randomized and counterbalanced, but the order of EUH and HYPO for each participant was maintained in the different menstrual phases. The experimental trials for each participant began at the same time of day (±1 h) to minimize diurnal variation in pain sensitivity (26) and ovarian hormone concentrations (27). All trials were separated by at least 48 h and were performed under standard environmental conditions (22°C, 50% relative humidity, room illuminance of 600 lx).

Familiarization
Before the experimental trials, participants were familiarized with the ischemic pain test (see Ischemic Pain Test) on two separate occasions to minimize potential learning and anxiety effects. The first familiarization session also included measurement of participants height and body mass (for calculation of fluid volume), and assessment of their maximal handgrip strength (see Maximal Handgrip Strength Assessment) to determine the absolute intensity for the submaximal contractions during the ischemic pain test. The number of familiarization sessions was determined from preliminary assessment of the time course of the learning effects, where pain outcome measures appeared to plateau after two sessions.

Maximal Handgrip Strength Assessment
Using their nondominant hand, participants performed three maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) with a handgrip dynamometer (MLT003 Grip Force Transducer, ADInstruments Inc., CO) (28). Participants were asked to squeeze the dynamometer maximally for 5 s during each MVC, separated by 1 min of rest. Force output from the dynamometer was recorded (PowerLab, ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand) and displayed in real-time (LabChart Pro, ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand). Maximal handgrip strength was determined by calculating the mean of the peak values for the three MVCs. This assessment was only conducted once during the first familiarization session, rather than at the start of each experimental trial, to prevent potential effects of the MVCs on subsequent pain sensitivity (28). Furthermore, maximal handgrip strength does not appear to be affected by menstrual phase (19, 29) or hypohydration (30, 31).

Dietary and Lifestyle Control
Participants refrained from pain-relieving medications, alcohol, and strenuous exercise at least 12 h before the start of each experimental trial. Participants also maintained their habitual caffeine intake over this 24-h period to minimize confounding effects of caffeine on pain sensitivity (32) and psychological variables (33, 34). To prevent caffeine withdrawal during the hypohydrated trials, participants who normally consumed caffeinated beverages were given a caffeine tablet (No-Doz Awakeners, Novartis Consumer Health, Inc.) to take in place of the beverages. Participants recorded their diet, physical activity, and time to bed and wake (i.e., sleep duration) during the 24-h period before their first trial and were asked to replicate these for subsequent trials. Participants completed a dietary and lifestyle record sheet at the start of each trial to assess adherence to these instructions.

Menstrual Cycle Phase and Hydration Intervention
Participants were tested during the EF and ML phases of their menstrual cycle to maximize the phase difference in ovarian hormone concentrations. The EF trials took place on days 4 (1) and 6 (2) and the ML trials on days 20 (2) and 22 (2), with day 1 representing start of menses and assuming a conventional 28-day menstrual cycle. Testing was scheduled using the three-step method (35) whereby self-reported menses onset and urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) testing (EasyCheck Ovulation Test, Phoenix Medcare, Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand) prospectively identified EF and ML, whereas measurement of serum 17?-estradiol and progesterone retrospectively confirmed ML. The EF phase was further verified by 17?-estradiol concentrations that were lower than in ML. Participants started daily LH testing 16 days before the end of a typical cycle until a positive LH test result was obtained (confirmed visually by the researchers), with ML trials then scheduled six to ten days after the positive LH test. To ensure ovulation had occurred and to minimize the likelihood of including anovulatory or luteal phase-deficient cycles, participants with progesterone < 5 ng·mL?1 were excluded from the final analyses (19, 36).

Twenty-four hours before each trial, participants were instructed to either restrict fluid intake and avoid consumption of high-water content foods (>50%, e.g., soups, vegetables, and fruits) (HYPO), or to drink ad libitum (EUH). Participants recorded their food and fluid intake over this 24-h period retrospectively at the start of each trial (see Dietary and Lifestyle Control and Experimental Protocol).

Experimental Protocol
Upon the participants arrival at the laboratory, a blood sample was obtained from the antecubital vein of the dominant arm via venepuncture. Participants then provided a urine sample and had their body mass measured. Urine specific gravity (USG) was measured immediately to confirm euhydration (USG < 1.020) or hypohydration (USG ? 1.020) (37). Participants then completed the dietary and lifestyle record sheet, Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (EUH only; see Measurements) and thirst ratings, followed by the ischemic pain test.

Immediately after the pain test, participants ingested a glass of water (5 mL·kg?1 of body mass measured during the first familiarization) and finished it within 5 min. This volume of water was previously shown to produce an immediate decrease in thirst perception in hypohydrated men (38). A 30-min break followed, during which participants remained in the laboratory and performed their activity of choice (e.g., reading and watching videos) that was consistent for all trials. After the break, participants repeated the thirst ratings and ischemic pain test. The duration of the break was determined based on previous data that examined the reliability of pressure pain measurements taken before and after 30 min of rest (39). Pain thresholds at both time points were not different; however, pain ratings decreased after the 30-min break in women, but not in men. Although this suggests that more than 30 min may be required to ameliorate carryover effects, especially in women, we decided on 30 min to prevent boredom and restlessness since participants had to remain in the laboratory during this period.

Ischemic Pain Test
The ischemic pain test consisted of the Submaximal Effort Tourniquet Procedure (40). This experimental pain stimulus was chosen as it is more clinically relevant than other pain stimuli (e.g., noxious heat, mechanical pressure, and electrical stimulation) (41). A pneumatic cuff was positioned on the participants nondominant arm, just above the elbow joint. The participants arm was passively raised to a vertical position for 30 s to promote venous drainage. The pneumatic cuff was then inflated to 250 mmHg and a stopwatch was started. The participants arm was immediately lowered to a horizontal position on the table, such that the forearm rests on the table with the elbow joint at a 90° angle. To promote forearm ischemia, participants performed 25 handgrip exercises at 30% of their predetermined maximum handgrip strength (see Familiarization). Each contraction was sustained for 2 s and followed by 2 s of rest. Auditory signals indicated the start and end of each contraction. Participants received continuous visual feedback of their force output and the target force on a laptop screen.

Upon completion of the handgrip exercises, the cuff remained inflated on the participants arm and participants watched a nature documentary to standardize their attention throughout the remainder of the pain test. The volume of the video was maintained at 30% for all trials. One minute after the end of the handgrip exercises, participants rated their pain intensity and unpleasantness on a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) (42). Participants were asked to indicate verbally when they were no longer able or willing to endure the pain (pain tolerance). The stopwatch was then stopped; just before the cuff was deflated, participants rated their pain intensity and unpleasantness again, to verify that they had reached pain tolerance. Unknown to participants, a maximum time limit of 20 min was enforced for the pain test.

Measurements
Anthropometric.
Participants height and body mass were measured using a stadiometer (Seca, Hamburg, Germany; accurate to 0.1 cm) and electronic scale (Model X3M, HIWEIGH Technologies Limited, Shanghai, China; accurate to 10 g), respectively.

Ovarian hormone concentrations.
Venous blood was collected into two 10 mL vacutainer tubes (Becton-Dickson, Oxford, UK). One tube contained clot activator for analysis of serum osmolality (Sosm), 17?-estradiol, and progesterone concentrations, whereas the other tube contained K3EDTA for analysis of plasma copeptin. The tube containing clot activator was inverted gently and left to clot for a minimum of 30 min at room temperature. The whole blood in both tubes was then centrifuged (Centrifuge 5804 R, Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) at 4°C and 260 g for 15 min to separate serum and plasma from whole blood. Aliquots of serum and plasma were then separated into three Eppendorf tubes (Genuine Axygen Quality) each and stored at ?80°C for further analysis. Commercially available enzyme-linked immune assays were used to measure concentrations of 17?-estradiol (Demeditec Diagnostics, Kiel, Germany) and progesterone (IBL International, Hamburg, Germany) in serum samples, with a sensitivity of 6.2 pg·mL?1 and 0.045 ng·mL?1, respectively, and an intra-assay variation of <6% and <7%, respectively. The ratio of progesterone to 17?-estradiol (P4:E2 ratio) was then calculated (43).

Hydration status.
Hydration status was assessed by measurement of Sosm, plasma copeptin concentrations, USG, ratings of thirst perception, and percent body mass change. Serum osmolality was measured via freezing-point depression (Digimatic osmometer Model 3D2, Advanced Instruments, Inc., Norwood, MA). Measurements were made in duplicate and averaged. If the two measurements differed by more than 5%, a third measurement was taken and the average of the two closest values was calculated. Plasma copeptin concentrations, a surrogate marker for AVP (44, 45), were measured with an automated immunofluorescent Copeptin proAVP KRYPTOR assay (B·R·A·H·M·S KRYPTOR compact PLUS analyzer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Henningsdorf, Germany), with a sensitivity of 1.08 pmol·L?1. Urine specific gravity was measured using a handheld clinical refractometer (Clinical Refractometer MASTER-SUR/NM, Atago Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Thirst perception was measured using pen and paper with a 10-cm VAS (46). Percent body mass change in HYPO was calculated from the EUH body mass within the same menstrual phase.

Psychological variables.
Depressive symptomatology was assessed using the CES-D (47). Given the 1-wk response timeframe of the CES-D, it was only administered once in each menstrual phase during the EUH trial.

Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software for Windows (IBM SPSS Statistics 20, NY). Descriptive values are reported as means (SD), unless otherwise stated. Data were assessed to ensure they were normally distributed and for sphericity, with no corrections needed. Data for Sosm, plasma copeptin, USG, body mass, 17?-estradiol, progesterone, and the P4:E2 ratio were assessed using a two-way (Phase × Hydration) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). For thirst ratings, pain tolerance and pain intensity, and unpleasantness ratings, the data were analyzed by three-way (Phase × Hydration × Water) repeated-measures ANOVA. When main or interaction effects occurred for the two- or three-way ANOVA, post hoc pair-wise analyses were conducted using paired-samples t tests with Bonferroni correction, where appropriate. Data for CES-D and percent body mass change were analyzed using a paired-samples t test to compare means between menstrual phases. Bivariate Pearsons correlations were performed to examine the direction and strength of relationships between the main independent (i.e., hydration markers and ovarian hormone concentrations) and dependent (i.e., ischemic pain measures) variables measured at baseline (i.e., before water ingestion). All pairwise data were included in the correlation analyses to maximize statistical power. Effect sizes are reported as partial eta-squared (?2p
) with demarcations of small (<0.06), medium (>0.06 and <0.14), and large (>0.14) effects, respectively (48). An a priori alpha of ? = 0.05 was used to demarcate statistically significant effects.

RESULTS
Following analysis of ovarian hormone concentrations, three participants did not meet the progesterone threshold of >5 ng·mL?1 and were excluded from subsequent analyses. Therefore, the following results are reported for the remaining 14 participants.

Self-Reported Sleep Duration and Depressive Symptomatology
Mean sleep duration across trials was 7.4 (1.6) h, which was not different between hydration conditions or menstrual phases (all P ? 0.15, ?2p
 ? 0.15). Incomplete data were collected for CES-D scores (n = 13). CES-D scores were not different between menstrual phases [EF: 10 (7) vs. ML: 12 (6); P = 0.55, ?2p
?=?0.03].

Ovarian Hormone Concentrations
Because of the difficulty in obtaining blood samples in one or more trials for three participants, incomplete data were obtained for serum 17?-estradiol and progesterone concentrations (n = 11 each). Both progesterone [by 25.8 (25.9) vs. 0.5 (0.2) ng·mL?1; P = 0.009, ?2p
?=?0.51] and 17?-estradiol [by 106 (58) vs. 52 (27) pg·mL?1; P = 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.66] concentrations were higher in the ML compared with EF phase but were not dependent on hydration status (Phase × Hydration: all P ? 0.46; ?2p
 ? 0.06) (Table 1). Accordingly, the P4:E2 ratio was also higher in the ML compared with EF phase (P = 0.005, ?2p
?=?0.57) independent of hydration status (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.78; ?2p
?=?0.01). Progesterone, 17?-estradiol, and the P4:E2 ratio were all unaffected by hydration status (all P ? 0.46, ?2p
 ? 0.06).

Hydration Status
Biochemical markers of hydration status obtained at baseline (i.e., before water ingestion) indicate that 24 h of fluid restriction was successful in eliciting mild dehydration (Table 2). Absolute body mass was lower in HYPO than in EUH (P = 0.006, ?2p
?=?0.45) but this was not dependent on menstrual phase (Phase × hydration: P = 0.31, ?2p
?=?0.08). Therefore, average percent change in body mass from EUH to HYPO was 0.9% (1.3).

Because of the difficulty in obtaining blood samples, incomplete data were collected for Sosm (n = 10) and plasma copeptin (n = 9). Sosm was higher during HYPO than EUH (P = 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.72) and was higher in EF than in ML (P = 0.03, ?2p
?=?0.43), but these effects were not dependent on menstrual phase or hydration status, respectively (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.22, ?2p
?=?0.17). Both plasma copeptin (P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.44) and USG (P < 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.84) were also higher in HYPO than in EUH, but these were not dependent on menstrual phase (Phase × hydration: both P ? 0.40, ?2p
 ? 0.09). In accordance with the significantly higher values of these biochemical markers, baseline thirst ratings were also higher during HYPO than in EUH (P < 0.001; ?2p
?=?0.89), independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.67, ?2p
?=?0.02).

Thirst Perception Ratings
Incomplete data were collected for thirst perception ratings (n = 13). Overall, thirst was higher during HYPO than EUH [by 3.2 (1.2) cm; P < 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.89] and was higher in ML than in EF [by 0.4 (0.6) cm; P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.30], but these effects were not dependent on menstrual phase or hydration status, respectively (Phase × hydration: P = 0.67, ?2p
?=?0.02). Thirst ratings decreased after water ingestion (from baseline) by a larger extent during HYPO than in EUH [? 4.0 (2.3) vs. ? 0.6 (1.4) cm; Hydration × Water: P < 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.65], independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration × Water: P = 0.47, ?
2
p
?=?0.05).
Ischemic Pain Tolerance
One participant was able to tolerate the ischemic pain for the maximum time limit of 20 min (1,200 s) in one trial (EUH trial in the ML phase) (Fig. 1). Her pain tolerance in this trial was therefore recorded as 1,200 s. Pain tolerance was lower during HYPO than in EUH [by 34 (46) s; P = 0.02, ?2p
?=?0.37), independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.15, ?2p
?=?0.15) or acute water ingestion (Hydration × Water: P = 0.92; ?2p
?=?0.001). Pain tolerance was unaffected by menstrual phase or acute water ingestion (both P ? 0.43, ?2p
 ? 0.05).

Ischemic Pain Intensity and Unpleasantness Ratings
Incomplete data were collected for pain intensity (Fig. 2) and unpleasantness (Fig. 3) at 1 min after handgrip exercise (n = 12 each) because two participants had terminated the pain test before this time point. Both pain intensity [6.6 (1.3) vs. 5.9 (1.4) cm; P = 0.004, ?2p
?=?0.55)] and pain unpleasantness [7.1 (1.3) vs. 6.4 (1.5) cm; P = 0.02, ?2p
?=?0.40] ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise were higher during HYPO than in EUH, independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration: both P ? 0.15, ?2p
 ? 0.18). Both pain intensity (P = 0.004, ?2p
?=?0.54) and pain unpleasantness (P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.34) ratings increased after water ingestion (from baseline), independently of hydration status (Hydration × Water: both P ? 0.50, ?2p
 ? 0.04) or menstrual phase (Phase × Water: both P ? 0.53, ?2p
 ? 0.04).

At pain tolerance, however, both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness ratings were not different between hydration conditions or menstrual phases (all P ? 0.13, ?2p
 ? 0.17). After water ingestion, pain intensity ratings increased by 3.4 (0.6) cm from baseline (P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.29) but pain unpleasantness was unaffected [+0.2 (4.6) cm; P = 0.10, ?2p
?=?0.20], independent of hydration status (Hydration × Water: both P ? 0.11, ?2p
 ? 0.19) or menstrual phase (Phase × Water: both P ? 0.55, ?2p
 ? 0.03).

Correlations
Serum concentrations of 17?-estradiol were negatively correlated with pain tolerance (r = ?0.31, P = 0.02) and positively correlated with pain unpleasantness ratings (r = 0.34, P = 0.02), but were not significantly associated with pain intensity ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (r = 0.23, P = 0.13). However, it should be noted that the strength of the significant correlations observed was weak (48) and therefore should be interpreted with caution. Neither progesterone nor the P4:E2 ratio was significantly associated with any of the ischemic pain measures (all r ? ?0.20, P ? 0.17). Similarly, no significant correlations were found between any of the hydration variables and ischemic pain measures (all r ? 0.20 and P ? 0.17).

DISCUSSION
This study examined the independent and combined effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in healthy eumenorrheic women, and the potential efficacy of acute water ingestion as a remedy to the deleterious impact of hypohydration. The main findings were that: 1) mild hypohydration increased pain sensitivity, 2) menstrual phase did not affect pain sensitivity, nor did it influence the effect of hypohydration on pain, and 3) acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity.

Hypohydration and Pain in Women
Independent of menstrual phase, mild hypohydration following 24 h of fluid restriction reduced pain tolerance (?8%) and increased pain intensity (+13%) and pain unpleasantness (+12%) ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (hereafter referred to as pain ratings) during ischemic pain stimulation, when compared with euhydration. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies that showed negative effects of mild hypohydration on experimental pain sensitivity in men (7, 8). Ogino et al. (7) observed a decrease in pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) following a combination of exercise-induced dehydration and fluid restriction, whereas Bear et al. (8) found an increase in pain intensity ratings but no difference in pain thresholds after 24 h of fluid restriction. Therefore, the current findings extend these previous results to women by showing that mild hypohydration also increases experimental pain sensitivity in women. The previous studies also did not include pain measures that reflect the affective/emotional experience of pain (i.e., pain tolerance or pain unpleasantness ratings) that may be important for chronic pain, whereas both pain threshold and pain intensity ratings assess the sensory/discriminative aspect of pain (49, 50). Although Bear et al. (8) measured pain tolerance, the nature of the stimulus-response relationship for the cold pressor taski.e., plateau and gradual decline in the perceived intensity of the pain stimulus (41)resulted in a large proportion (?2/3) of participants who were able to tolerate the pain until the 4-min cut-off time, thereby precluding meaningful analyses of the results. This issue was not apparent with the ischemic pain test used in the present study, as there was only one instance where the 20-min time limit was reached. Therefore, the current findings further add to the previous data by showing that mild hypohydration also negatively impacts the affective/emotional aspect of pain, as evidenced by the decrease in pain tolerance and increase in pain unpleasantness ratings compared with EUH.

The exact mechanisms underlying the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration cannot be determined from the current data. However, one potential mechanism through which hypohydration may increase pain sensitivity is thirst perception. Geuter et al. (51) showed that an increase in thirst perceptioninduced by consumption of salty snacks followed by 5 h of fluid deprivationled to an increase in pain intensity ratings during noxious heat stimulation, whereas subsequent ad libitum fluid intake, which reduced thirst perception, decreased pain ratings. In another study, stimulation of thirst sensation via hypertonic saline infusion increased pain intensity ratings during noxious pressure stimulation, which were associated with stronger activation of pain-related brain regions; namely, the anterior cingulate cortex and insula (52). Similar findings were reported in the study by Ogino et al. (7). These brain regions were previously shown to be activated and deactivated independently by an increase and decrease in thirst perception, respectively (5254). However, it is not apparent from these data whether the increased pain sensitivity and pain-related brain activity were due to thirst perception per se, physiological hypohydration, or both.

Menstrual Phase and Experimental Pain Sensitivity
Menstrual phase did not modulate the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration, nor did it independently affect pain sensitivity. The lack of a menstrual phase effect on ischemic pain sensitivity is consistent with the findings of most previous studies that examined ischemic pain responses across the menstrual cycle (18, 5558). In contrast, studies by Fillingim et al. (59) and Pfleeger et al. (60) observed greater pain sensitivity during the luteal compared with follicular phase. However, concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone were not measured in the study by Pfleeger et al. (60), whereas the specific definition of the luteal phase used by Fillingim et al. (59) differed from that in the current study. We examined the ML phase when concentrations of both 17?-estradiol and progesterone are elevated, whereas Fillingim et al. (59) included the late-luteal period in their classification of the luteal phase, during which concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone are declining rapidly and are less stable compared with the ML phase. Given that menstrual phases characterized by fluctuating or unstable 17?-estradiol levels have been associated with increased severity of various chronic pain conditions (14), this may explain why Fillingim et al. (59) observed phase differences in pain sensitivity whereas we did not.

The equivocal and inconclusive results regarding menstrual phase effects on experimental pain sensitivity are thought to be due, in part, to the lack of proper verification of menstrual phases through blood measurements of 17?-estradiol and progesterone (15, 16), making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relationship between menstrual phase/hormone status and pain sensitivity. Similar to previous observations (22, 23), Sosm was lower in the ML than EF phase (Table 2); however, this phase difference in hydration did not appear to impact any of the ischemic pain measures (Figs. 13). In this study, we showed that after hydration status was controlled, menstrual phases were properly verified and potential confounders (e.g., dietary and lifestyle factors and dysmenorrhea) were minimized, there was no difference in ischemic pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases. As such, our data suggest that the hormonal fluctuations within the menstrual cycle do not greatly impact pain sensitivity.

Interestingly, although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phase, there was a positive correlation between 17?-estradiol and pain sensitivity, suggesting that women with higher baseline levels of 17?-estradiol may be more sensitive to pain than those with lower 17?-estradiol levels (i.e., between-subject effect). However, given the weak strength of the correlation (r = ?0.32) (48), this finding should be interpreted with caution.

Effects of Acute Water Ingestion
Given that thirst perception may be a potential mechanism linking hypohydration and increased pain sensitivity, we hypothesized that acute water ingestion when hypohydrated would reduce pain sensitivity. This would also help to delineate the effects of thirst and hypohydration per se, on pain, since acute water ingestion would be expected to reduce thirst without altering hydration status (38, 61). However, contrary to our hypothesis, ischemic pain tolerance was not affected by ingestion of 5 mL·kg?1 of water, despite the significant decrease in thirst perception ratings. Meanwhile, ratings of both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness increased, which may appear counterintuitive as participants reported feeling more pain despite being less thirsty. These unexpected findings may be explained by carryover (sensitization) effects from the baseline pain test. A previous study showed that repeated pain stimulation within a single session produced a sensitization effect, whereby pain ratings increased gradually with each repeated stimulation (62). Therefore, this sensitization effect may have masked potential positive effects of acute water ingestion on pain. Future studies that either utilize a longer interval between the repeated pain tests, or perform the postwater ingestion pain test on a separate day, are required to gain further understanding on the relative importance of thirst perception and physiological hypohydration on pain.

Considerations
There are several considerations and limitations of this study that should be noted in addition to those already discussed earlier. First, only healthy, eumenorrheic women were included in this study, which ignores postmenopausal women and oral contraceptive pill users, who have different hormonal profiles compared with eumenorrheic women. Therefore, it is possible that hypohydration may affect pain sensitivity differently in these women compared with eumenorrheic women. Second, blood samples were not obtained after water ingestion to confirm that hydration status was not altered. However, previous data indicate that consuming a moderate volume of water, similar to that in the current study, does not acutely alter hydration status in hypohydrated men (38, 61). In addition, the relatively short interval of 30 min between water ingestion and the subsequent pain test was likely insufficient for hydration status to be altered, because a previous study showed that at least 75 min is required for 300 mL of water to be completely absorbed into the bloodstream (63). Third, as participants could not be blinded to the hydration intervention, the increased pain sensitivity observed during HYPO may have been confounded by nocebo effects (64, 65). Although participants were not aware of the study hypotheses, they were aware of the aims of the study, one of which was to investigate the effects of hypohydration on pain sensitivity. Given the negative connotations of hypohydration or dehydration, it is conceivable that participants would expect hypohydration to increase pain sensitivity, which may have subsequently influenced participants actual responses to the ischemic pain test. Fourth, the body mass change values in HYPO may not accurately reflect the fluid losses induced by the 24 h of fluid restriction. Due to the scheduling constraints that included two experimental visits within 3 days per menstrual phase, we were unable to obtain a baseline body mass at the start of the hydration intervention; thus, body mass change in HYPO was calculated using EUH body mass. As the EUH and HYPO trials within each menstrual phase were separated by at least 48 h, it is likely that the values were confounded by factors other than the change in body water content (e.g., urine and fecal losses, food and fluid consumption). Acknowledging this limitation, we obtained other measures of hydration status (i.e., Sosm, USG, copeptin, and thirst ratings) in addition to body mass change for a more accurate assessment of hydrations status. Finally, our sample size may have limited our ability to detect statistically significant menstrual phase effects on pain. As such, the effects of menstrual phase on pain require further investigation. Our study could provide a reference for future studies with a similar design to base their sample size calculations on. Nevertheless, large effect sizes (?2p
 = 0.370.55) were obtained for the main effect of hypohydration on pain, with an observed power of 0.70.9, which suggests a low probability of false negatives.

Perspectives and Significance
Our data indicate that hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women and this effect may not be reversed immediately by water ingestion. Whereas, menstrual phase (EF vs. ML) does not appear to affect pain sensitivity. These findings suggest that insufficient water intake throughout the day may exacerbate pain perception in healthy women. Given the high prevalence of hypohydration among the general population (25), future studies should investigate whether hypohydration may worsen chronic pain conditions, and the potential efficacy of maintaining adequate hydration in alleviating pain symptoms. This may be especially important for older adults, who are more likely to be hypohydrated and experience chronic pain (25, 66). For human pain researchers, controlling or measuring hydration status of participants may be important to minimize confound, as clinically and physiologically relevant tests such as the cold pressor are affected (67). Although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases after controlling for hydration status, more high-quality research is required to accurately determine whether menstrual phase does or does not affect pain sensitivity. Therefore, until a consensus on the topic has been reached, our data do not discount the need for future pain researchers to verify menstrual phase.

Chronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17?-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a womans pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34?±?46 s; P = 0.02, ?2p
 = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7?±?0.7 cm; P = 0.004; ?2p
 = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7?±?0.9 cm; P = 0.02; ?2p
 = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3?±?0.9 cm; P < 0.001, ?2p
 = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.

NEW & NOTEWORTHY Whether hypohydration can increase pain in women remains untested. Menstrual phase may influence pain, but findings are equivocal and may be confounded by the lack of hydration measures. We found that pain sensitivity in women increased after 24 h of fluid restriction versus ad libitum fluid intake, but did not differ between menstrual phases. Water ingestion did not acutely attenuate the negative effects of hypohydration on pain, highlighting the importance of staying well-hydrated throughout the day.

INTRODUCTION
Pain is recognized as a public health problem (1). Chronic pain [i.e., pain that persists for ?3 mo (2)] in particular, affects ?20% of the global population (3, 4), with negative consequences to the individual, society, healthcare, and the economy. In the United States, the annual cost of chronic pain is estimated to be $635 millionmore than that of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes combined (5). However, chronic pain treatment has proven difficult due to the complex and multifactorial nature of pain (6). In a survey conducted across several European countries, 40% of chronic pain sufferers reported feeling dissatisfied with the effectiveness of their pain treatment(s) (4). Hence, more research on the mechanisms and factors contributing to a persons pain experience is needed. Given the various complexities of studying chronic pain (e.g., ethical, logistical, and medical considerations), such research is usually performed by administering various acute experimental pain stimuli to healthy individuals.

Recent studies have shown that hypohydration can increase experimental pain sensitivity (7, 8). Mild hypohydration of <1% body mass loss, induced by prior fasting and exercise, was found to decrease pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) during a cold pressor task in men, compared with when they were rehydrated (7). These findings were supported in a later study, where subjective ratings of cold pressor pain in men were higher after 24 h of fluid restriction (1.4% body mass loss) than in the euhydrated condition (8). Similarly, a field study showed that hypohydrated cyclists perceived more intense pain in their leg muscles during an ultra-endurance race, compared with the euhydrated cyclists (9). However, these studies were primarily performed in men and the effects of hypohydration on pain in women have not been formally investigated.

Several chronic pain conditions are more prevalent among women than men (10). Women also tend to display greater sensitivity to various experimental pain stimuli (11). Furthermore, pain perception in women may be influenced by hormonal fluctuations (primarily 17?-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle (12, 13). It is generally agreed that the severity of pain symptoms in several chronic pain conditions varies across the menstrual cycle (13, 14); however, whether the menstrual phase affects experimental pain sensitivity in healthy, pain-free women is still contestable (15, 16). The lack of accurate verification of menstrual phases and presence of various potential confounders (e.g., dysmenorrhea, dietary, and lifestyle factors) in many studies could explain the inconsistent findings (15). Some studies have attempted to address these issues (e.g., see Refs. 17 and 18), but such studies are scant and did not appear to impose a progesterone threshold to ensure only ovulatory cycles were included (19). Notably, none of the previous studies measured hydration status of participants at the time of testing, which may be influenced by menstrual phase (20, 21).

The ovarian hormones affect body fluid regulatory mechanisms (22), with potential implications for hydration status (20, 21). The mid-luteal phase (high 17?-estradiol and progesterone) is associated with an earlier release of arginine vasopressin (AVP)a fluid-regulatory hormone that increases renal water retentionand thirst during exercise-induced dehydration or hypertonic saline infusion, compared with the early follicular phase (low 17?-estradiol and progesterone) (23, 24). This may potentially reduce the severity of dehydration for a given hydration challenge in the mid-luteal phase (20, 21). In the context of pain, this may suggest: 1) differences in the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration in the early follicular compared with mid-luteal phase, 2) potential variability in hydration status across the menstrual cycle may have confounded previous research on effects of the menstrual phase and experimental pain sensitivity, and 3) hypohydration may reduce the efficacy of pain treatments in women (21).

Importantly, mild hypohydration appears to be common among women, with data from the United States showing approximately half of the 7,855 surveyed women meeting the hypohydration criterion (plasma tonicity > 295 mmol·L?1) (25). Therefore, the current study investigated the effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in women. We also examined whether the negative consequences of hypohydration on pain could be remedied by acute water ingestion. We hypothesized that 1) hypohydration would increase experimental pain sensitivity in women, 2) the magnitude of this increase in pain sensitivity would differ between the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases, and 3) acute water ingestion would reverse the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration.

METHODS
Ethical Approval
The study was approved by the Massey University Human Ethics Committee: Southern A (18/66). The study conformed to the requirements of the US Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (45 CFR, Part 46), and the standards set by the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki, except for registration in a database. All participants provided written, informed consent before all trials. Researchers were not blinded to the experimental conditions and analyses.

Participants
Twenty-three healthy, eumenorrheic women initially volunteered for this study. As this is the first study, to our knowledge, that has investigated the effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase in combination, there was no reference study to base our sample size calculations on. As such, sample size was estimated from two previous studies; one on hypohydration and pain (? = 0.79 and effect size = 0.53) (8) and the other on a meta-analysis on menstrual phase effects on pain (effect size = 0.5 for ischemic pain, ? = 0.80) (12), which yielded required sample sizes of n = 17 and n = 27, respectively at an ? = 0.05. Therefore, we aimed for 17 > n < 27 and estimated the required number of participants for sufficient power to be n = 22.

Six participants did not proceed with the experimental trials due to scheduling difficulties; thus, 17 women completed all experimental trials [means (SD): age, 28 (8) yr; height, 1.63 (0.07) m; body mass, 65.0 (10.8) kg]. Participants reported having regular menstrual cycles (i.e., 2135 days) at the time of recruitment and had not used hormonal contraceptives within the past 6 mo. All participants were nonsmokers, had no pre-existing or history of medical, psychiatric, pain-related, or menstrual-related disorders (e.g., dysmenorrhea, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and premenstrual syndrome), and were not taking any medications. Taking into consideration these inclusion/exclusion criteria, women aged > 18 < 50 yr were recruited. All participants, except for one, were recreationally physically active, engaging in at least 150 min of structured exercise per week.

Experimental Overview
Participants attended the laboratory on six occasions: two familiarization sessions, followed by four experimental trials. The four experimental trials were a full crossover of menstrual phase (EF and ML) and hydration status [euhydrated (EUH) and hypohydrated (HYPO)] and were performed over one or two menstrual cycles. The order of the experimental trials was randomized and counterbalanced, but the order of EUH and HYPO for each participant was maintained in the different menstrual phases. The experimental trials for each participant began at the same time of day (±1 h) to minimize diurnal variation in pain sensitivity (26) and ovarian hormone concentrations (27). All trials were separated by at least 48 h and were performed under standard environmental conditions (22°C, 50% relative humidity, room illuminance of 600 lx).

Familiarization
Before the experimental trials, participants were familiarized with the ischemic pain test (see Ischemic Pain Test) on two separate occasions to minimize potential learning and anxiety effects. The first familiarization session also included measurement of participants height and body mass (for calculation of fluid volume), and assessment of their maximal handgrip strength (see Maximal Handgrip Strength Assessment) to determine the absolute intensity for the submaximal contractions during the ischemic pain test. The number of familiarization sessions was determined from preliminary assessment of the time course of the learning effects, where pain outcome measures appeared to plateau after two sessions.

Maximal Handgrip Strength Assessment
Using their nondominant hand, participants performed three maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) with a handgrip dynamometer (MLT003 Grip Force Transducer, ADInstruments Inc., CO) (28). Participants were asked to squeeze the dynamometer maximally for 5 s during each MVC, separated by 1 min of rest. Force output from the dynamometer was recorded (PowerLab, ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand) and displayed in real-time (LabChart Pro, ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand). Maximal handgrip strength was determined by calculating the mean of the peak values for the three MVCs. This assessment was only conducted once during the first familiarization session, rather than at the start of each experimental trial, to prevent potential effects of the MVCs on subsequent pain sensitivity (28). Furthermore, maximal handgrip strength does not appear to be affected by menstrual phase (19, 29) or hypohydration (30, 31).

Dietary and Lifestyle Control
Participants refrained from pain-relieving medications, alcohol, and strenuous exercise at least 12 h before the start of each experimental trial. Participants also maintained their habitual caffeine intake over this 24-h period to minimize confounding effects of caffeine on pain sensitivity (32) and psychological variables (33, 34). To prevent caffeine withdrawal during the hypohydrated trials, participants who normally consumed caffeinated beverages were given a caffeine tablet (No-Doz Awakeners, Novartis Consumer Health, Inc.) to take in place of the beverages. Participants recorded their diet, physical activity, and time to bed and wake (i.e., sleep duration) during the 24-h period before their first trial and were asked to replicate these for subsequent trials. Participants completed a dietary and lifestyle record sheet at the start of each trial to assess adherence to these instructions.

Menstrual Cycle Phase and Hydration Intervention
Participants were tested during the EF and ML phases of their menstrual cycle to maximize the phase difference in ovarian hormone concentrations. The EF trials took place on days 4 (1) and 6 (2) and the ML trials on days 20 (2) and 22 (2), with day 1 representing start of menses and assuming a conventional 28-day menstrual cycle. Testing was scheduled using the three-step method (35) whereby self-reported menses onset and urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) testing (EasyCheck Ovulation Test, Phoenix Medcare, Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand) prospectively identified EF and ML, whereas measurement of serum 17?-estradiol and progesterone retrospectively confirmed ML. The EF phase was further verified by 17?-estradiol concentrations that were lower than in ML. Participants started daily LH testing 16 days before the end of a typical cycle until a positive LH test result was obtained (confirmed visually by the researchers), with ML trials then scheduled six to ten days after the positive LH test. To ensure ovulation had occurred and to minimize the likelihood of including anovulatory or luteal phase-deficient cycles, participants with progesterone < 5 ng·mL?1 were excluded from the final analyses (19, 36).

Twenty-four hours before each trial, participants were instructed to either restrict fluid intake and avoid consumption of high-water content foods (>50%, e.g., soups, vegetables, and fruits) (HYPO), or to drink ad libitum (EUH). Participants recorded their food and fluid intake over this 24-h period retrospectively at the start of each trial (see Dietary and Lifestyle Control and Experimental Protocol).

Experimental Protocol
Upon the participants arrival at the laboratory, a blood sample was obtained from the antecubital vein of the dominant arm via venepuncture. Participants then provided a urine sample and had their body mass measured. Urine specific gravity (USG) was measured immediately to confirm euhydration (USG < 1.020) or hypohydration (USG ? 1.020) (37). Participants then completed the dietary and lifestyle record sheet, Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (EUH only; see Measurements) and thirst ratings, followed by the ischemic pain test.

Immediately after the pain test, participants ingested a glass of water (5 mL·kg?1 of body mass measured during the first familiarization) and finished it within 5 min. This volume of water was previously shown to produce an immediate decrease in thirst perception in hypohydrated men (38). A 30-min break followed, during which participants remained in the laboratory and performed their activity of choice (e.g., reading and watching videos) that was consistent for all trials. After the break, participants repeated the thirst ratings and ischemic pain test. The duration of the break was determined based on previous data that examined the reliability of pressure pain measurements taken before and after 30 min of rest (39). Pain thresholds at both time points were not different; however, pain ratings decreased after the 30-min break in women, but not in men. Although this suggests that more than 30 min may be required to ameliorate carryover effects, especially in women, we decided on 30 min to prevent boredom and restlessness since participants had to remain in the laboratory during this period.

Ischemic Pain Test
The ischemic pain test consisted of the Submaximal Effort Tourniquet Procedure (40). This experimental pain stimulus was chosen as it is more clinically relevant than other pain stimuli (e.g., noxious heat, mechanical pressure, and electrical stimulation) (41). A pneumatic cuff was positioned on the participants nondominant arm, just above the elbow joint. The participants arm was passively raised to a vertical position for 30 s to promote venous drainage. The pneumatic cuff was then inflated to 250 mmHg and a stopwatch was started. The participants arm was immediately lowered to a horizontal position on the table, such that the forearm rests on the table with the elbow joint at a 90° angle. To promote forearm ischemia, participants performed 25 handgrip exercises at 30% of their predetermined maximum handgrip strength (see Familiarization). Each contraction was sustained for 2 s and followed by 2 s of rest. Auditory signals indicated the start and end of each contraction. Participants received continuous visual feedback of their force output and the target force on a laptop screen.

Upon completion of the handgrip exercises, the cuff remained inflated on the participants arm and participants watched a nature documentary to standardize their attention throughout the remainder of the pain test. The volume of the video was maintained at 30% for all trials. One minute after the end of the handgrip exercises, participants rated their pain intensity and unpleasantness on a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) (42). Participants were asked to indicate verbally when they were no longer able or willing to endure the pain (pain tolerance). The stopwatch was then stopped; just before the cuff was deflated, participants rated their pain intensity and unpleasantness again, to verify that they had reached pain tolerance. Unknown to participants, a maximum time limit of 20 min was enforced for the pain test.

Measurements
Anthropometric.
Participants height and body mass were measured using a stadiometer (Seca, Hamburg, Germany; accurate to 0.1 cm) and electronic scale (Model X3M, HIWEIGH Technologies Limited, Shanghai, China; accurate to 10 g), respectively.

Ovarian hormone concentrations.
Venous blood was collected into two 10 mL vacutainer tubes (Becton-Dickson, Oxford, UK). One tube contained clot activator for analysis of serum osmolality (Sosm), 17?-estradiol, and progesterone concentrations, whereas the other tube contained K3EDTA for analysis of plasma copeptin. The tube containing clot activator was inverted gently and left to clot for a minimum of 30 min at room temperature. The whole blood in both tubes was then centrifuged (Centrifuge 5804 R, Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) at 4°C and 260 g for 15 min to separate serum and plasma from whole blood. Aliquots of serum and plasma were then separated into three Eppendorf tubes (Genuine Axygen Quality) each and stored at ?80°C for further analysis. Commercially available enzyme-linked immune assays were used to measure concentrations of 17?-estradiol (Demeditec Diagnostics, Kiel, Germany) and progesterone (IBL International, Hamburg, Germany) in serum samples, with a sensitivity of 6.2 pg·mL?1 and 0.045 ng·mL?1, respectively, and an intra-assay variation of <6% and <7%, respectively. The ratio of progesterone to 17?-estradiol (P4:E2 ratio) was then calculated (43).

Hydration status.
Hydration status was assessed by measurement of Sosm, plasma copeptin concentrations, USG, ratings of thirst perception, and percent body mass change. Serum osmolality was measured via freezing-point depression (Digimatic osmometer Model 3D2, Advanced Instruments, Inc., Norwood, MA). Measurements were made in duplicate and averaged. If the two measurements differed by more than 5%, a third measurement was taken and the average of the two closest values was calculated. Plasma copeptin concentrations, a surrogate marker for AVP (44, 45), were measured with an automated immunofluorescent Copeptin proAVP KRYPTOR assay (B·R·A·H·M·S KRYPTOR compact PLUS analyzer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Henningsdorf, Germany), with a sensitivity of 1.08 pmol·L?1. Urine specific gravity was measured using a handheld clinical refractometer (Clinical Refractometer MASTER-SUR/NM, Atago Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Thirst perception was measured using pen and paper with a 10-cm VAS (46). Percent body mass change in HYPO was calculated from the EUH body mass within the same menstrual phase.

Psychological variables.
Depressive symptomatology was assessed using the CES-D (47). Given the 1-wk response timeframe of the CES-D, it was only administered once in each menstrual phase during the EUH trial.

Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software for Windows (IBM SPSS Statistics 20, NY). Descriptive values are reported as means (SD), unless otherwise stated. Data were assessed to ensure they were normally distributed and for sphericity, with no corrections needed. Data for Sosm, plasma copeptin, USG, body mass, 17?-estradiol, progesterone, and the P4:E2 ratio were assessed using a two-way (Phase × Hydration) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). For thirst ratings, pain tolerance and pain intensity, and unpleasantness ratings, the data were analyzed by three-way (Phase × Hydration × Water) repeated-measures ANOVA. When main or interaction effects occurred for the two- or three-way ANOVA, post hoc pair-wise analyses were conducted using paired-samples t tests with Bonferroni correction, where appropriate. Data for CES-D and percent body mass change were analyzed using a paired-samples t test to compare means between menstrual phases. Bivariate Pearsons correlations were performed to examine the direction and strength of relationships between the main independent (i.e., hydration markers and ovarian hormone concentrations) and dependent (i.e., ischemic pain measures) variables measured at baseline (i.e., before water ingestion). All pairwise data were included in the correlation analyses to maximize statistical power. Effect sizes are reported as partial eta-squared (?2p
) with demarcations of small (<0.06), medium (>0.06 and <0.14), and large (>0.14) effects, respectively (48). An a priori alpha of ? = 0.05 was used to demarcate statistically significant effects.

RESULTS
Following analysis of ovarian hormone concentrations, three participants did not meet the progesterone threshold of >5 ng·mL?1 and were excluded from subsequent analyses. Therefore, the following results are reported for the remaining 14 participants.

Self-Reported Sleep Duration and Depressive Symptomatology
Mean sleep duration across trials was 7.4 (1.6) h, which was not different between hydration conditions or menstrual phases (all P ? 0.15, ?2p
 ? 0.15). Incomplete data were collected for CES-D scores (n = 13). CES-D scores were not different between menstrual phases [EF: 10 (7) vs. ML: 12 (6); P = 0.55, ?2p
?=?0.03].

Ovarian Hormone Concentrations
Because of the difficulty in obtaining blood samples in one or more trials for three participants, incomplete data were obtained for serum 17?-estradiol and progesterone concentrations (n = 11 each). Both progesterone [by 25.8 (25.9) vs. 0.5 (0.2) ng·mL?1; P = 0.009, ?2p
?=?0.51] and 17?-estradiol [by 106 (58) vs. 52 (27) pg·mL?1; P = 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.66] concentrations were higher in the ML compared with EF phase but were not dependent on hydration status (Phase × Hydration: all P ? 0.46; ?2p
 ? 0.06) (Table 1). Accordingly, the P4:E2 ratio was also higher in the ML compared with EF phase (P = 0.005, ?2p
?=?0.57) independent of hydration status (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.78; ?2p
?=?0.01). Progesterone, 17?-estradiol, and the P4:E2 ratio were all unaffected by hydration status (all P ? 0.46, ?2p
 ? 0.06).

Hydration Status
Biochemical markers of hydration status obtained at baseline (i.e., before water ingestion) indicate that 24 h of fluid restriction was successful in eliciting mild dehydration (Table 2). Absolute body mass was lower in HYPO than in EUH (P = 0.006, ?2p
?=?0.45) but this was not dependent on menstrual phase (Phase × hydration: P = 0.31, ?2p
?=?0.08). Therefore, average percent change in body mass from EUH to HYPO was 0.9% (1.3).

Because of the difficulty in obtaining blood samples, incomplete data were collected for Sosm (n = 10) and plasma copeptin (n = 9). Sosm was higher during HYPO than EUH (P = 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.72) and was higher in EF than in ML (P = 0.03, ?2p
?=?0.43), but these effects were not dependent on menstrual phase or hydration status, respectively (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.22, ?2p
?=?0.17). Both plasma copeptin (P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.44) and USG (P < 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.84) were also higher in HYPO than in EUH, but these were not dependent on menstrual phase (Phase × hydration: both P ? 0.40, ?2p
 ? 0.09). In accordance with the significantly higher values of these biochemical markers, baseline thirst ratings were also higher during HYPO than in EUH (P < 0.001; ?2p
?=?0.89), independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.67, ?2p
?=?0.02).

Thirst Perception Ratings
Incomplete data were collected for thirst perception ratings (n = 13). Overall, thirst was higher during HYPO than EUH [by 3.2 (1.2) cm; P < 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.89] and was higher in ML than in EF [by 0.4 (0.6) cm; P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.30], but these effects were not dependent on menstrual phase or hydration status, respectively (Phase × hydration: P = 0.67, ?2p
?=?0.02). Thirst ratings decreased after water ingestion (from baseline) by a larger extent during HYPO than in EUH [? 4.0 (2.3) vs. ? 0.6 (1.4) cm; Hydration × Water: P < 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.65], independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration × Water: P = 0.47, ?
2
p
?=?0.05).
Ischemic Pain Tolerance
One participant was able to tolerate the ischemic pain for the maximum time limit of 20 min (1,200 s) in one trial (EUH trial in the ML phase) (Fig. 1). Her pain tolerance in this trial was therefore recorded as 1,200 s. Pain tolerance was lower during HYPO than in EUH [by 34 (46) s; P = 0.02, ?2p
?=?0.37), independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.15, ?2p
?=?0.15) or acute water ingestion (Hydration × Water: P = 0.92; ?2p
?=?0.001). Pain tolerance was unaffected by menstrual phase or acute water ingestion (both P ? 0.43, ?2p
 ? 0.05).

Ischemic Pain Intensity and Unpleasantness Ratings
Incomplete data were collected for pain intensity (Fig. 2) and unpleasantness (Fig. 3) at 1 min after handgrip exercise (n = 12 each) because two participants had terminated the pain test before this time point. Both pain intensity [6.6 (1.3) vs. 5.9 (1.4) cm; P = 0.004, ?2p
?=?0.55)] and pain unpleasantness [7.1 (1.3) vs. 6.4 (1.5) cm; P = 0.02, ?2p
?=?0.40] ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise were higher during HYPO than in EUH, independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration: both P ? 0.15, ?2p
 ? 0.18). Both pain intensity (P = 0.004, ?2p
?=?0.54) and pain unpleasantness (P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.34) ratings increased after water ingestion (from baseline), independently of hydration status (Hydration × Water: both P ? 0.50, ?2p
 ? 0.04) or menstrual phase (Phase × Water: both P ? 0.53, ?2p
 ? 0.04).

At pain tolerance, however, both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness ratings were not different between hydration conditions or menstrual phases (all P ? 0.13, ?2p
 ? 0.17). After water ingestion, pain intensity ratings increased by 3.4 (0.6) cm from baseline (P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.29) but pain unpleasantness was unaffected [+0.2 (4.6) cm; P = 0.10, ?2p
?=?0.20], independent of hydration status (Hydration × Water: both P ? 0.11, ?2p
 ? 0.19) or menstrual phase (Phase × Water: both P ? 0.55, ?2p
 ? 0.03).

Correlations
Serum concentrations of 17?-estradiol were negatively correlated with pain tolerance (r = ?0.31, P = 0.02) and positively correlated with pain unpleasantness ratings (r = 0.34, P = 0.02), but were not significantly associated with pain intensity ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (r = 0.23, P = 0.13). However, it should be noted that the strength of the significant correlations observed was weak (48) and therefore should be interpreted with caution. Neither progesterone nor the P4:E2 ratio was significantly associated with any of the ischemic pain measures (all r ? ?0.20, P ? 0.17). Similarly, no significant correlations were found between any of the hydration variables and ischemic pain measures (all r ? 0.20 and P ? 0.17).

DISCUSSION
This study examined the independent and combined effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in healthy eumenorrheic women, and the potential efficacy of acute water ingestion as a remedy to the deleterious impact of hypohydration. The main findings were that: 1) mild hypohydration increased pain sensitivity, 2) menstrual phase did not affect pain sensitivity, nor did it influence the effect of hypohydration on pain, and 3) acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity.

Hypohydration and Pain in Women
Independent of menstrual phase, mild hypohydration following 24 h of fluid restriction reduced pain tolerance (?8%) and increased pain intensity (+13%) and pain unpleasantness (+12%) ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (hereafter referred to as pain ratings) during ischemic pain stimulation, when compared with euhydration. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies that showed negative effects of mild hypohydration on experimental pain sensitivity in men (7, 8). Ogino et al. (7) observed a decrease in pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) following a combination of exercise-induced dehydration and fluid restriction, whereas Bear et al. (8) found an increase in pain intensity ratings but no difference in pain thresholds after 24 h of fluid restriction. Therefore, the current findings extend these previous results to women by showing that mild hypohydration also increases experimental pain sensitivity in women. The previous studies also did not include pain measures that reflect the affective/emotional experience of pain (i.e., pain tolerance or pain unpleasantness ratings) that may be important for chronic pain, whereas both pain threshold and pain intensity ratings assess the sensory/discriminative aspect of pain (49, 50). Although Bear et al. (8) measured pain tolerance, the nature of the stimulus-response relationship for the cold pressor taski.e., plateau and gradual decline in the perceived intensity of the pain stimulus (41)resulted in a large proportion (?2/3) of participants who were able to tolerate the pain until the 4-min cut-off time, thereby precluding meaningful analyses of the results. This issue was not apparent with the ischemic pain test used in the present study, as there was only one instance where the 20-min time limit was reached. Therefore, the current findings further add to the previous data by showing that mild hypohydration also negatively impacts the affective/emotional aspect of pain, as evidenced by the decrease in pain tolerance and increase in pain unpleasantness ratings compared with EUH.

The exact mechanisms underlying the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration cannot be determined from the current data. However, one potential mechanism through which hypohydration may increase pain sensitivity is thirst perception. Geuter et al. (51) showed that an increase in thirst perceptioninduced by consumption of salty snacks followed by 5 h of fluid deprivationled to an increase in pain intensity ratings during noxious heat stimulation, whereas subsequent ad libitum fluid intake, which reduced thirst perception, decreased pain ratings. In another study, stimulation of thirst sensation via hypertonic saline infusion increased pain intensity ratings during noxious pressure stimulation, which were associated with stronger activation of pain-related brain regions; namely, the anterior cingulate cortex and insula (52). Similar findings were reported in the study by Ogino et al. (7). These brain regions were previously shown to be activated and deactivated independently by an increase and decrease in thirst perception, respectively (5254). However, it is not apparent from these data whether the increased pain sensitivity and pain-related brain activity were due to thirst perception per se, physiological hypohydration, or both.

Menstrual Phase and Experimental Pain Sensitivity
Menstrual phase did not modulate the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration, nor did it independently affect pain sensitivity. The lack of a menstrual phase effect on ischemic pain sensitivity is consistent with the findings of most previous studies that examined ischemic pain responses across the menstrual cycle (18, 5558). In contrast, studies by Fillingim et al. (59) and Pfleeger et al. (60) observed greater pain sensitivity during the luteal compared with follicular phase. However, concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone were not measured in the study by Pfleeger et al. (60), whereas the specific definition of the luteal phase used by Fillingim et al. (59) differed from that in the current study. We examined the ML phase when concentrations of both 17?-estradiol and progesterone are elevated, whereas Fillingim et al. (59) included the late-luteal period in their classification of the luteal phase, during which concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone are declining rapidly and are less stable compared with the ML phase. Given that menstrual phases characterized by fluctuating or unstable 17?-estradiol levels have been associated with increased severity of various chronic pain conditions (14), this may explain why Fillingim et al. (59) observed phase differences in pain sensitivity whereas we did not.

The equivocal and inconclusive results regarding menstrual phase effects on experimental pain sensitivity are thought to be due, in part, to the lack of proper verification of menstrual phases through blood measurements of 17?-estradiol and progesterone (15, 16), making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relationship between menstrual phase/hormone status and pain sensitivity. Similar to previous observations (22, 23), Sosm was lower in the ML than EF phase (Table 2); however, this phase difference in hydration did not appear to impact any of the ischemic pain measures (Figs. 13). In this study, we showed that after hydration status was controlled, menstrual phases were properly verified and potential confounders (e.g., dietary and lifestyle factors and dysmenorrhea) were minimized, there was no difference in ischemic pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases. As such, our data suggest that the hormonal fluctuations within the menstrual cycle do not greatly impact pain sensitivity.

Interestingly, although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phase, there was a positive correlation between 17?-estradiol and pain sensitivity, suggesting that women with higher baseline levels of 17?-estradiol may be more sensitive to pain than those with lower 17?-estradiol levels (i.e., between-subject effect). However, given the weak strength of the correlation (r = ?0.32) (48), this finding should be interpreted with caution.

Effects of Acute Water Ingestion
Given that thirst perception may be a potential mechanism linking hypohydration and increased pain sensitivity, we hypothesized that acute water ingestion when hypohydrated would reduce pain sensitivity. This would also help to delineate the effects of thirst and hypohydration per se, on pain, since acute water ingestion would be expected to reduce thirst without altering hydration status (38, 61). However, contrary to our hypothesis, ischemic pain tolerance was not affected by ingestion of 5 mL·kg?1 of water, despite the significant decrease in thirst perception ratings. Meanwhile, ratings of both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness increased, which may appear counterintuitive as participants reported feeling more pain despite being less thirsty. These unexpected findings may be explained by carryover (sensitization) effects from the baseline pain test. A previous study showed that repeated pain stimulation within a single session produced a sensitization effect, whereby pain ratings increased gradually with each repeated stimulation (62). Therefore, this sensitization effect may have masked potential positive effects of acute water ingestion on pain. Future studies that either utilize a longer interval between the repeated pain tests, or perform the postwater ingestion pain test on a separate day, are required to gain further understanding on the relative importance of thirst perception and physiological hypohydration on pain.

Considerations
There are several considerations and limitations of this study that should be noted in addition to those already discussed earlier. First, only healthy, eumenorrheic women were included in this study, which ignores postmenopausal women and oral contraceptive pill users, who have different hormonal profiles compared with eumenorrheic women. Therefore, it is possible that hypohydration may affect pain sensitivity differently in these women compared with eumenorrheic women. Second, blood samples were not obtained after water ingestion to confirm that hydration status was not altered. However, previous data indicate that consuming a moderate volume of water, similar to that in the current study, does not acutely alter hydration status in hypohydrated men (38, 61). In addition, the relatively short interval of 30 min between water ingestion and the subsequent pain test was likely insufficient for hydration status to be altered, because a previous study showed that at least 75 min is required for 300 mL of water to be completely absorbed into the bloodstream (63). Third, as participants could not be blinded to the hydration intervention, the increased pain sensitivity observed during HYPO may have been confounded by nocebo effects (64, 65). Although participants were not aware of the study hypotheses, they were aware of the aims of the study, one of which was to investigate the effects of hypohydration on pain sensitivity. Given the negative connotations of hypohydration or dehydration, it is conceivable that participants would expect hypohydration to increase pain sensitivity, which may have subsequently influenced participants actual responses to the ischemic pain test. Fourth, the body mass change values in HYPO may not accurately reflect the fluid losses induced by the 24 h of fluid restriction. Due to the scheduling constraints that included two experimental visits within 3 days per menstrual phase, we were unable to obtain a baseline body mass at the start of the hydration intervention; thus, body mass change in HYPO was calculated using EUH body mass. As the EUH and HYPO trials within each menstrual phase were separated by at least 48 h, it is likely that the values were confounded by factors other than the change in body water content (e.g., urine and fecal losses, food and fluid consumption). Acknowledging this limitation, we obtained other measures of hydration status (i.e., Sosm, USG, copeptin, and thirst ratings) in addition to body mass change for a more accurate assessment of hydrations status. Finally, our sample size may have limited our ability to detect statistically significant menstrual phase effects on pain. As such, the effects of menstrual phase on pain require further investigation. Our study could provide a reference for future studies with a similar design to base their sample size calculations on. Nevertheless, large effect sizes (?2p
 = 0.370.55) were obtained for the main effect of hypohydration on pain, with an observed power of 0.70.9, which suggests a low probability of false negatives.

Perspectives and Significance
Our data indicate that hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women and this effect may not be reversed immediately by water ingestion. Whereas, menstrual phase (EF vs. ML) does not appear to affect pain sensitivity. These findings suggest that insufficient water intake throughout the day may exacerbate pain perception in healthy women. Given the high prevalence of hypohydration among the general population (25), future studies should investigate whether hypohydration may worsen chronic pain conditions, and the potential efficacy of maintaining adequate hydration in alleviating pain symptoms. This may be especially important for older adults, who are more likely to be hypohydrated and experience chronic pain (25, 66). For human pain researchers, controlling or measuring hydration status of participants may be important to minimize confound, as clinically and physiologically relevant tests such as the cold pressor are affected (67). Although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases after controlling for hydration status, more high-quality research is required to accurately determine whether menstrual phase does or does not affect pain sensitivity. Therefore, until a consensus on the topic has been reached, our data do not discount the need for future pain researchers to verify menstrual phase.

Chronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17?-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a womans pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34?±?46 s; P = 0.02, ?2p
 = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7?±?0.7 cm; P = 0.004; ?2p
 = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7?±?0.9 cm; P = 0.02; ?2p
 = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3?±?0.9 cm; P < 0.001, ?2p
 = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.

NEW & NOTEWORTHY Whether hypohydration can increase pain in women remains untested. Menstrual phase may influence pain, but findings are equivocal and may be confounded by the lack of hydration measures. We found that pain sensitivity in women increased after 24 h of fluid restriction versus ad libitum fluid intake, but did not differ between menstrual phases. Water ingestion did not acutely attenuate the negative effects of hypohydration on pain, highlighting the importance of staying well-hydrated throughout the day.

INTRODUCTION
Pain is recognized as a public health problem (1). Chronic pain [i.e., pain that persists for ?3 mo (2)] in particular, affects ?20% of the global population (3, 4), with negative consequences to the individual, society, healthcare, and the economy. In the United States, the annual cost of chronic pain is estimated to be $635 millionmore than that of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes combined (5). However, chronic pain treatment has proven difficult due to the complex and multifactorial nature of pain (6). In a survey conducted across several European countries, 40% of chronic pain sufferers reported feeling dissatisfied with the effectiveness of their pain treatment(s) (4). Hence, more research on the mechanisms and factors contributing to a persons pain experience is needed. Given the various complexities of studying chronic pain (e.g., ethical, logistical, and medical considerations), such research is usually performed by administering various acute experimental pain stimuli to healthy individuals.

Recent studies have shown that hypohydration can increase experimental pain sensitivity (7, 8). Mild hypohydration of <1% body mass loss, induced by prior fasting and exercise, was found to decrease pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) during a cold pressor task in men, compared with when they were rehydrated (7). These findings were supported in a later study, where subjective ratings of cold pressor pain in men were higher after 24 h of fluid restriction (1.4% body mass loss) than in the euhydrated condition (8). Similarly, a field study showed that hypohydrated cyclists perceived more intense pain in their leg muscles during an ultra-endurance race, compared with the euhydrated cyclists (9). However, these studies were primarily performed in men and the effects of hypohydration on pain in women have not been formally investigated.

Several chronic pain conditions are more prevalent among women than men (10). Women also tend to display greater sensitivity to various experimental pain stimuli (11). Furthermore, pain perception in women may be influenced by hormonal fluctuations (primarily 17?-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle (12, 13). It is generally agreed that the severity of pain symptoms in several chronic pain conditions varies across the menstrual cycle (13, 14); however, whether the menstrual phase affects experimental pain sensitivity in healthy, pain-free women is still contestable (15, 16). The lack of accurate verification of menstrual phases and presence of various potential confounders (e.g., dysmenorrhea, dietary, and lifestyle factors) in many studies could explain the inconsistent findings (15). Some studies have attempted to address these issues (e.g., see Refs. 17 and 18), but such studies are scant and did not appear to impose a progesterone threshold to ensure only ovulatory cycles were included (19). Notably, none of the previous studies measured hydration status of participants at the time of testing, which may be influenced by menstrual phase (20, 21).

The ovarian hormones affect body fluid regulatory mechanisms (22), with potential implications for hydration status (20, 21). The mid-luteal phase (high 17?-estradiol and progesterone) is associated with an earlier release of arginine vasopressin (AVP)a fluid-regulatory hormone that increases renal water retentionand thirst during exercise-induced dehydration or hypertonic saline infusion, compared with the early follicular phase (low 17?-estradiol and progesterone) (23, 24). This may potentially reduce the severity of dehydration for a given hydration challenge in the mid-luteal phase (20, 21). In the context of pain, this may suggest: 1) differences in the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration in the early follicular compared with mid-luteal phase, 2) potential variability in hydration status across the menstrual cycle may have confounded previous research on effects of the menstrual phase and experimental pain sensitivity, and 3) hypohydration may reduce the efficacy of pain treatments in women (21).

Importantly, mild hypohydration appears to be common among women, with data from the United States showing approximately half of the 7,855 surveyed women meeting the hypohydration criterion (plasma tonicity > 295 mmol·L?1) (25). Therefore, the current study investigated the effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in women. We also examined whether the negative consequences of hypohydration on pain could be remedied by acute water ingestion. We hypothesized that 1) hypohydration would increase experimental pain sensitivity in women, 2) the magnitude of this increase in pain sensitivity would differ between the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases, and 3) acute water ingestion would reverse the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration.

METHODS
Ethical Approval
The study was approved by the Massey University Human Ethics Committee: Southern A (18/66). The study conformed to the requirements of the US Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (45 CFR, Part 46), and the standards set by the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki, except for registration in a database. All participants provided written, informed consent before all trials. Researchers were not blinded to the experimental conditions and analyses.

Participants
Twenty-three healthy, eumenorrheic women initially volunteered for this study. As this is the first study, to our knowledge, that has investigated the effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase in combination, there was no reference study to base our sample size calculations on. As such, sample size was estimated from two previous studies; one on hypohydration and pain (? = 0.79 and effect size = 0.53) (8) and the other on a meta-analysis on menstrual phase effects on pain (effect size = 0.5 for ischemic pain, ? = 0.80) (12), which yielded required sample sizes of n = 17 and n = 27, respectively at an ? = 0.05. Therefore, we aimed for 17 > n < 27 and estimated the required number of participants for sufficient power to be n = 22.

Six participants did not proceed with the experimental trials due to scheduling difficulties; thus, 17 women completed all experimental trials [means (SD): age, 28 (8) yr; height, 1.63 (0.07) m; body mass, 65.0 (10.8) kg]. Participants reported having regular menstrual cycles (i.e., 2135 days) at the time of recruitment and had not used hormonal contraceptives within the past 6 mo. All participants were nonsmokers, had no pre-existing or history of medical, psychiatric, pain-related, or menstrual-related disorders (e.g., dysmenorrhea, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and premenstrual syndrome), and were not taking any medications. Taking into consideration these inclusion/exclusion criteria, women aged > 18 < 50 yr were recruited. All participants, except for one, were recreationally physically active, engaging in at least 150 min of structured exercise per week.

Experimental Overview
Participants attended the laboratory on six occasions: two familiarization sessions, followed by four experimental trials. The four experimental trials were a full crossover of menstrual phase (EF and ML) and hydration status [euhydrated (EUH) and hypohydrated (HYPO)] and were performed over one or two menstrual cycles. The order of the experimental trials was randomized and counterbalanced, but the order of EUH and HYPO for each participant was maintained in the different menstrual phases. The experimental trials for each participant began at the same time of day (±1 h) to minimize diurnal variation in pain sensitivity (26) and ovarian hormone concentrations (27). All trials were separated by at least 48 h and were performed under standard environmental conditions (22°C, 50% relative humidity, room illuminance of 600 lx).

Familiarization
Before the experimental trials, participants were familiarized with the ischemic pain test (see Ischemic Pain Test) on two separate occasions to minimize potential learning and anxiety effects. The first familiarization session also included measurement of participants height and body mass (for calculation of fluid volume), and assessment of their maximal handgrip strength (see Maximal Handgrip Strength Assessment) to determine the absolute intensity for the submaximal contractions during the ischemic pain test. The number of familiarization sessions was determined from preliminary assessment of the time course of the learning effects, where pain outcome measures appeared to plateau after two sessions.

Maximal Handgrip Strength Assessment
Using their nondominant hand, participants performed three maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) with a handgrip dynamometer (MLT003 Grip Force Transducer, ADInstruments Inc., CO) (28). Participants were asked to squeeze the dynamometer maximally for 5 s during each MVC, separated by 1 min of rest. Force output from the dynamometer was recorded (PowerLab, ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand) and displayed in real-time (LabChart Pro, ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand). Maximal handgrip strength was determined by calculating the mean of the peak values for the three MVCs. This assessment was only conducted once during the first familiarization session, rather than at the start of each experimental trial, to prevent potential effects of the MVCs on subsequent pain sensitivity (28). Furthermore, maximal handgrip strength does not appear to be affected by menstrual phase (19, 29) or hypohydration (30, 31).

Dietary and Lifestyle Control
Participants refrained from pain-relieving medications, alcohol, and strenuous exercise at least 12 h before the start of each experimental trial. Participants also maintained their habitual caffeine intake over this 24-h period to minimize confounding effects of caffeine on pain sensitivity (32) and psychological variables (33, 34). To prevent caffeine withdrawal during the hypohydrated trials, participants who normally consumed caffeinated beverages were given a caffeine tablet (No-Doz Awakeners, Novartis Consumer Health, Inc.) to take in place of the beverages. Participants recorded their diet, physical activity, and time to bed and wake (i.e., sleep duration) during the 24-h period before their first trial and were asked to replicate these for subsequent trials. Participants completed a dietary and lifestyle record sheet at the start of each trial to assess adherence to these instructions.

Menstrual Cycle Phase and Hydration Intervention
Participants were tested during the EF and ML phases of their menstrual cycle to maximize the phase difference in ovarian hormone concentrations. The EF trials took place on days 4 (1) and 6 (2) and the ML trials on days 20 (2) and 22 (2), with day 1 representing start of menses and assuming a conventional 28-day menstrual cycle. Testing was scheduled using the three-step method (35) whereby self-reported menses onset and urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) testing (EasyCheck Ovulation Test, Phoenix Medcare, Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand) prospectively identified EF and ML, whereas measurement of serum 17?-estradiol and progesterone retrospectively confirmed ML. The EF phase was further verified by 17?-estradiol concentrations that were lower than in ML. Participants started daily LH testing 16 days before the end of a typical cycle until a positive LH test result was obtained (confirmed visually by the researchers), with ML trials then scheduled six to ten days after the positive LH test. To ensure ovulation had occurred and to minimize the likelihood of including anovulatory or luteal phase-deficient cycles, participants with progesterone < 5 ng·mL?1 were excluded from the final analyses (19, 36).

Twenty-four hours before each trial, participants were instructed to either restrict fluid intake and avoid consumption of high-water content foods (>50%, e.g., soups, vegetables, and fruits) (HYPO), or to drink ad libitum (EUH). Participants recorded their food and fluid intake over this 24-h period retrospectively at the start of each trial (see Dietary and Lifestyle Control and Experimental Protocol).

Experimental Protocol
Upon the participants arrival at the laboratory, a blood sample was obtained from the antecubital vein of the dominant arm via venepuncture. Participants then provided a urine sample and had their body mass measured. Urine specific gravity (USG) was measured immediately to confirm euhydration (USG < 1.020) or hypohydration (USG ? 1.020) (37). Participants then completed the dietary and lifestyle record sheet, Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (EUH only; see Measurements) and thirst ratings, followed by the ischemic pain test.

Immediately after the pain test, participants ingested a glass of water (5 mL·kg?1 of body mass measured during the first familiarization) and finished it within 5 min. This volume of water was previously shown to produce an immediate decrease in thirst perception in hypohydrated men (38). A 30-min break followed, during which participants remained in the laboratory and performed their activity of choice (e.g., reading and watching videos) that was consistent for all trials. After the break, participants repeated the thirst ratings and ischemic pain test. The duration of the break was determined based on previous data that examined the reliability of pressure pain measurements taken before and after 30 min of rest (39). Pain thresholds at both time points were not different; however, pain ratings decreased after the 30-min break in women, but not in men. Although this suggests that more than 30 min may be required to ameliorate carryover effects, especially in women, we decided on 30 min to prevent boredom and restlessness since participants had to remain in the laboratory during this period.

Ischemic Pain Test
The ischemic pain test consisted of the Submaximal Effort Tourniquet Procedure (40). This experimental pain stimulus was chosen as it is more clinically relevant than other pain stimuli (e.g., noxious heat, mechanical pressure, and electrical stimulation) (41). A pneumatic cuff was positioned on the participants nondominant arm, just above the elbow joint. The participants arm was passively raised to a vertical position for 30 s to promote venous drainage. The pneumatic cuff was then inflated to 250 mmHg and a stopwatch was started. The participants arm was immediately lowered to a horizontal position on the table, such that the forearm rests on the table with the elbow joint at a 90° angle. To promote forearm ischemia, participants performed 25 handgrip exercises at 30% of their predetermined maximum handgrip strength (see Familiarization). Each contraction was sustained for 2 s and followed by 2 s of rest. Auditory signals indicated the start and end of each contraction. Participants received continuous visual feedback of their force output and the target force on a laptop screen.

Upon completion of the handgrip exercises, the cuff remained inflated on the participants arm and participants watched a nature documentary to standardize their attention throughout the remainder of the pain test. The volume of the video was maintained at 30% for all trials. One minute after the end of the handgrip exercises, participants rated their pain intensity and unpleasantness on a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) (42). Participants were asked to indicate verbally when they were no longer able or willing to endure the pain (pain tolerance). The stopwatch was then stopped; just before the cuff was deflated, participants rated their pain intensity and unpleasantness again, to verify that they had reached pain tolerance. Unknown to participants, a maximum time limit of 20 min was enforced for the pain test.

Measurements
Anthropometric.
Participants height and body mass were measured using a stadiometer (Seca, Hamburg, Germany; accurate to 0.1 cm) and electronic scale (Model X3M, HIWEIGH Technologies Limited, Shanghai, China; accurate to 10 g), respectively.

Ovarian hormone concentrations.
Venous blood was collected into two 10 mL vacutainer tubes (Becton-Dickson, Oxford, UK). One tube contained clot activator for analysis of serum osmolality (Sosm), 17?-estradiol, and progesterone concentrations, whereas the other tube contained K3EDTA for analysis of plasma copeptin. The tube containing clot activator was inverted gently and left to clot for a minimum of 30 min at room temperature. The whole blood in both tubes was then centrifuged (Centrifuge 5804 R, Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) at 4°C and 260 g for 15 min to separate serum and plasma from whole blood. Aliquots of serum and plasma were then separated into three Eppendorf tubes (Genuine Axygen Quality) each and stored at ?80°C for further analysis. Commercially available enzyme-linked immune assays were used to measure concentrations of 17?-estradiol (Demeditec Diagnostics, Kiel, Germany) and progesterone (IBL International, Hamburg, Germany) in serum samples, with a sensitivity of 6.2 pg·mL?1 and 0.045 ng·mL?1, respectively, and an intra-assay variation of <6% and <7%, respectively. The ratio of progesterone to 17?-estradiol (P4:E2 ratio) was then calculated (43).

Hydration status.
Hydration status was assessed by measurement of Sosm, plasma copeptin concentrations, USG, ratings of thirst perception, and percent body mass change. Serum osmolality was measured via freezing-point depression (Digimatic osmometer Model 3D2, Advanced Instruments, Inc., Norwood, MA). Measurements were made in duplicate and averaged. If the two measurements differed by more than 5%, a third measurement was taken and the average of the two closest values was calculated. Plasma copeptin concentrations, a surrogate marker for AVP (44, 45), were measured with an automated immunofluorescent Copeptin proAVP KRYPTOR assay (B·R·A·H·M·S KRYPTOR compact PLUS analyzer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Henningsdorf, Germany), with a sensitivity of 1.08 pmol·L?1. Urine specific gravity was measured using a handheld clinical refractometer (Clinical Refractometer MASTER-SUR/NM, Atago Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Thirst perception was measured using pen and paper with a 10-cm VAS (46). Percent body mass change in HYPO was calculated from the EUH body mass within the same menstrual phase.

Psychological variables.
Depressive symptomatology was assessed using the CES-D (47). Given the 1-wk response timeframe of the CES-D, it was only administered once in each menstrual phase during the EUH trial.

Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software for Windows (IBM SPSS Statistics 20, NY). Descriptive values are reported as means (SD), unless otherwise stated. Data were assessed to ensure they were normally distributed and for sphericity, with no corrections needed. Data for Sosm, plasma copeptin, USG, body mass, 17?-estradiol, progesterone, and the P4:E2 ratio were assessed using a two-way (Phase × Hydration) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). For thirst ratings, pain tolerance and pain intensity, and unpleasantness ratings, the data were analyzed by three-way (Phase × Hydration × Water) repeated-measures ANOVA. When main or interaction effects occurred for the two- or three-way ANOVA, post hoc pair-wise analyses were conducted using paired-samples t tests with Bonferroni correction, where appropriate. Data for CES-D and percent body mass change were analyzed using a paired-samples t test to compare means between menstrual phases. Bivariate Pearsons correlations were performed to examine the direction and strength of relationships between the main independent (i.e., hydration markers and ovarian hormone concentrations) and dependent (i.e., ischemic pain measures) variables measured at baseline (i.e., before water ingestion). All pairwise data were included in the correlation analyses to maximize statistical power. Effect sizes are reported as partial eta-squared (?2p
) with demarcations of small (<0.06), medium (>0.06 and <0.14), and large (>0.14) effects, respectively (48). An a priori alpha of ? = 0.05 was used to demarcate statistically significant effects.

RESULTS
Following analysis of ovarian hormone concentrations, three participants did not meet the progesterone threshold of >5 ng·mL?1 and were excluded from subsequent analyses. Therefore, the following results are reported for the remaining 14 participants.

Self-Reported Sleep Duration and Depressive Symptomatology
Mean sleep duration across trials was 7.4 (1.6) h, which was not different between hydration conditions or menstrual phases (all P ? 0.15, ?2p
 ? 0.15). Incomplete data were collected for CES-D scores (n = 13). CES-D scores were not different between menstrual phases [EF: 10 (7) vs. ML: 12 (6); P = 0.55, ?2p
?=?0.03].

Ovarian Hormone Concentrations
Because of the difficulty in obtaining blood samples in one or more trials for three participants, incomplete data were obtained for serum 17?-estradiol and progesterone concentrations (n = 11 each). Both progesterone [by 25.8 (25.9) vs. 0.5 (0.2) ng·mL?1; P = 0.009, ?2p
?=?0.51] and 17?-estradiol [by 106 (58) vs. 52 (27) pg·mL?1; P = 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.66] concentrations were higher in the ML compared with EF phase but were not dependent on hydration status (Phase × Hydration: all P ? 0.46; ?2p
 ? 0.06) (Table 1). Accordingly, the P4:E2 ratio was also higher in the ML compared with EF phase (P = 0.005, ?2p
?=?0.57) independent of hydration status (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.78; ?2p
?=?0.01). Progesterone, 17?-estradiol, and the P4:E2 ratio were all unaffected by hydration status (all P ? 0.46, ?2p
 ? 0.06).

Hydration Status
Biochemical markers of hydration status obtained at baseline (i.e., before water ingestion) indicate that 24 h of fluid restriction was successful in eliciting mild dehydration (Table 2). Absolute body mass was lower in HYPO than in EUH (P = 0.006, ?2p
?=?0.45) but this was not dependent on menstrual phase (Phase × hydration: P = 0.31, ?2p
?=?0.08). Therefore, average percent change in body mass from EUH to HYPO was 0.9% (1.3).

Because of the difficulty in obtaining blood samples, incomplete data were collected for Sosm (n = 10) and plasma copeptin (n = 9). Sosm was higher during HYPO than EUH (P = 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.72) and was higher in EF than in ML (P = 0.03, ?2p
?=?0.43), but these effects were not dependent on menstrual phase or hydration status, respectively (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.22, ?2p
?=?0.17). Both plasma copeptin (P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.44) and USG (P < 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.84) were also higher in HYPO than in EUH, but these were not dependent on menstrual phase (Phase × hydration: both P ? 0.40, ?2p
 ? 0.09). In accordance with the significantly higher values of these biochemical markers, baseline thirst ratings were also higher during HYPO than in EUH (P < 0.001; ?2p
?=?0.89), independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.67, ?2p
?=?0.02).

Thirst Perception Ratings
Incomplete data were collected for thirst perception ratings (n = 13). Overall, thirst was higher during HYPO than EUH [by 3.2 (1.2) cm; P < 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.89] and was higher in ML than in EF [by 0.4 (0.6) cm; P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.30], but these effects were not dependent on menstrual phase or hydration status, respectively (Phase × hydration: P = 0.67, ?2p
?=?0.02). Thirst ratings decreased after water ingestion (from baseline) by a larger extent during HYPO than in EUH [? 4.0 (2.3) vs. ? 0.6 (1.4) cm; Hydration × Water: P < 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.65], independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration × Water: P = 0.47, ?
2
p
?=?0.05).
Ischemic Pain Tolerance
One participant was able to tolerate the ischemic pain for the maximum time limit of 20 min (1,200 s) in one trial (EUH trial in the ML phase) (Fig. 1). Her pain tolerance in this trial was therefore recorded as 1,200 s. Pain tolerance was lower during HYPO than in EUH [by 34 (46) s; P = 0.02, ?2p
?=?0.37), independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.15, ?2p
?=?0.15) or acute water ingestion (Hydration × Water: P = 0.92; ?2p
?=?0.001). Pain tolerance was unaffected by menstrual phase or acute water ingestion (both P ? 0.43, ?2p
 ? 0.05).

Ischemic Pain Intensity and Unpleasantness Ratings
Incomplete data were collected for pain intensity (Fig. 2) and unpleasantness (Fig. 3) at 1 min after handgrip exercise (n = 12 each) because two participants had terminated the pain test before this time point. Both pain intensity [6.6 (1.3) vs. 5.9 (1.4) cm; P = 0.004, ?2p
?=?0.55)] and pain unpleasantness [7.1 (1.3) vs. 6.4 (1.5) cm; P = 0.02, ?2p
?=?0.40] ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise were higher during HYPO than in EUH, independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration: both P ? 0.15, ?2p
 ? 0.18). Both pain intensity (P = 0.004, ?2p
?=?0.54) and pain unpleasantness (P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.34) ratings increased after water ingestion (from baseline), independently of hydration status (Hydration × Water: both P ? 0.50, ?2p
 ? 0.04) or menstrual phase (Phase × Water: both P ? 0.53, ?2p
 ? 0.04).

At pain tolerance, however, both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness ratings were not different between hydration conditions or menstrual phases (all P ? 0.13, ?2p
 ? 0.17). After water ingestion, pain intensity ratings increased by 3.4 (0.6) cm from baseline (P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.29) but pain unpleasantness was unaffected [+0.2 (4.6) cm; P = 0.10, ?2p
?=?0.20], independent of hydration status (Hydration × Water: both P ? 0.11, ?2p
 ? 0.19) or menstrual phase (Phase × Water: both P ? 0.55, ?2p
 ? 0.03).

Correlations
Serum concentrations of 17?-estradiol were negatively correlated with pain tolerance (r = ?0.31, P = 0.02) and positively correlated with pain unpleasantness ratings (r = 0.34, P = 0.02), but were not significantly associated with pain intensity ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (r = 0.23, P = 0.13). However, it should be noted that the strength of the significant correlations observed was weak (48) and therefore should be interpreted with caution. Neither progesterone nor the P4:E2 ratio was significantly associated with any of the ischemic pain measures (all r ? ?0.20, P ? 0.17). Similarly, no significant correlations were found between any of the hydration variables and ischemic pain measures (all r ? 0.20 and P ? 0.17).

DISCUSSION
This study examined the independent and combined effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in healthy eumenorrheic women, and the potential efficacy of acute water ingestion as a remedy to the deleterious impact of hypohydration. The main findings were that: 1) mild hypohydration increased pain sensitivity, 2) menstrual phase did not affect pain sensitivity, nor did it influence the effect of hypohydration on pain, and 3) acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity.

Hypohydration and Pain in Women
Independent of menstrual phase, mild hypohydration following 24 h of fluid restriction reduced pain tolerance (?8%) and increased pain intensity (+13%) and pain unpleasantness (+12%) ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (hereafter referred to as pain ratings) during ischemic pain stimulation, when compared with euhydration. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies that showed negative effects of mild hypohydration on experimental pain sensitivity in men (7, 8). Ogino et al. (7) observed a decrease in pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) following a combination of exercise-induced dehydration and fluid restriction, whereas Bear et al. (8) found an increase in pain intensity ratings but no difference in pain thresholds after 24 h of fluid restriction. Therefore, the current findings extend these previous results to women by showing that mild hypohydration also increases experimental pain sensitivity in women. The previous studies also did not include pain measures that reflect the affective/emotional experience of pain (i.e., pain tolerance or pain unpleasantness ratings) that may be important for chronic pain, whereas both pain threshold and pain intensity ratings assess the sensory/discriminative aspect of pain (49, 50). Although Bear et al. (8) measured pain tolerance, the nature of the stimulus-response relationship for the cold pressor taski.e., plateau and gradual decline in the perceived intensity of the pain stimulus (41)resulted in a large proportion (?2/3) of participants who were able to tolerate the pain until the 4-min cut-off time, thereby precluding meaningful analyses of the results. This issue was not apparent with the ischemic pain test used in the present study, as there was only one instance where the 20-min time limit was reached. Therefore, the current findings further add to the previous data by showing that mild hypohydration also negatively impacts the affective/emotional aspect of pain, as evidenced by the decrease in pain tolerance and increase in pain unpleasantness ratings compared with EUH.

The exact mechanisms underlying the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration cannot be determined from the current data. However, one potential mechanism through which hypohydration may increase pain sensitivity is thirst perception. Geuter et al. (51) showed that an increase in thirst perceptioninduced by consumption of salty snacks followed by 5 h of fluid deprivationled to an increase in pain intensity ratings during noxious heat stimulation, whereas subsequent ad libitum fluid intake, which reduced thirst perception, decreased pain ratings. In another study, stimulation of thirst sensation via hypertonic saline infusion increased pain intensity ratings during noxious pressure stimulation, which were associated with stronger activation of pain-related brain regions; namely, the anterior cingulate cortex and insula (52). Similar findings were reported in the study by Ogino et al. (7). These brain regions were previously shown to be activated and deactivated independently by an increase and decrease in thirst perception, respectively (5254). However, it is not apparent from these data whether the increased pain sensitivity and pain-related brain activity were due to thirst perception per se, physiological hypohydration, or both.

Menstrual Phase and Experimental Pain Sensitivity
Menstrual phase did not modulate the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration, nor did it independently affect pain sensitivity. The lack of a menstrual phase effect on ischemic pain sensitivity is consistent with the findings of most previous studies that examined ischemic pain responses across the menstrual cycle (18, 5558). In contrast, studies by Fillingim et al. (59) and Pfleeger et al. (60) observed greater pain sensitivity during the luteal compared with follicular phase. However, concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone were not measured in the study by Pfleeger et al. (60), whereas the specific definition of the luteal phase used by Fillingim et al. (59) differed from that in the current study. We examined the ML phase when concentrations of both 17?-estradiol and progesterone are elevated, whereas Fillingim et al. (59) included the late-luteal period in their classification of the luteal phase, during which concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone are declining rapidly and are less stable compared with the ML phase. Given that menstrual phases characterized by fluctuating or unstable 17?-estradiol levels have been associated with increased severity of various chronic pain conditions (14), this may explain why Fillingim et al. (59) observed phase differences in pain sensitivity whereas we did not.

The equivocal and inconclusive results regarding menstrual phase effects on experimental pain sensitivity are thought to be due, in part, to the lack of proper verification of menstrual phases through blood measurements of 17?-estradiol and progesterone (15, 16), making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relationship between menstrual phase/hormone status and pain sensitivity. Similar to previous observations (22, 23), Sosm was lower in the ML than EF phase (Table 2); however, this phase difference in hydration did not appear to impact any of the ischemic pain measures (Figs. 13). In this study, we showed that after hydration status was controlled, menstrual phases were properly verified and potential confounders (e.g., dietary and lifestyle factors and dysmenorrhea) were minimized, there was no difference in ischemic pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases. As such, our data suggest that the hormonal fluctuations within the menstrual cycle do not greatly impact pain sensitivity.

Interestingly, although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phase, there was a positive correlation between 17?-estradiol and pain sensitivity, suggesting that women with higher baseline levels of 17?-estradiol may be more sensitive to pain than those with lower 17?-estradiol levels (i.e., between-subject effect). However, given the weak strength of the correlation (r = ?0.32) (48), this finding should be interpreted with caution.

Effects of Acute Water Ingestion
Given that thirst perception may be a potential mechanism linking hypohydration and increased pain sensitivity, we hypothesized that acute water ingestion when hypohydrated would reduce pain sensitivity. This would also help to delineate the effects of thirst and hypohydration per se, on pain, since acute water ingestion would be expected to reduce thirst without altering hydration status (38, 61). However, contrary to our hypothesis, ischemic pain tolerance was not affected by ingestion of 5 mL·kg?1 of water, despite the significant decrease in thirst perception ratings. Meanwhile, ratings of both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness increased, which may appear counterintuitive as participants reported feeling more pain despite being less thirsty. These unexpected findings may be explained by carryover (sensitization) effects from the baseline pain test. A previous study showed that repeated pain stimulation within a single session produced a sensitization effect, whereby pain ratings increased gradually with each repeated stimulation (62). Therefore, this sensitization effect may have masked potential positive effects of acute water ingestion on pain. Future studies that either utilize a longer interval between the repeated pain tests, or perform the postwater ingestion pain test on a separate day, are required to gain further understanding on the relative importance of thirst perception and physiological hypohydration on pain.

Considerations
There are several considerations and limitations of this study that should be noted in addition to those already discussed earlier. First, only healthy, eumenorrheic women were included in this study, which ignores postmenopausal women and oral contraceptive pill users, who have different hormonal profiles compared with eumenorrheic women. Therefore, it is possible that hypohydration may affect pain sensitivity differently in these women compared with eumenorrheic women. Second, blood samples were not obtained after water ingestion to confirm that hydration status was not altered. However, previous data indicate that consuming a moderate volume of water, similar to that in the current study, does not acutely alter hydration status in hypohydrated men (38, 61). In addition, the relatively short interval of 30 min between water ingestion and the subsequent pain test was likely insufficient for hydration status to be altered, because a previous study showed that at least 75 min is required for 300 mL of water to be completely absorbed into the bloodstream (63). Third, as participants could not be blinded to the hydration intervention, the increased pain sensitivity observed during HYPO may have been confounded by nocebo effects (64, 65). Although participants were not aware of the study hypotheses, they were aware of the aims of the study, one of which was to investigate the effects of hypohydration on pain sensitivity. Given the negative connotations of hypohydration or dehydration, it is conceivable that participants would expect hypohydration to increase pain sensitivity, which may have subsequently influenced participants actual responses to the ischemic pain test. Fourth, the body mass change values in HYPO may not accurately reflect the fluid losses induced by the 24 h of fluid restriction. Due to the scheduling constraints that included two experimental visits within 3 days per menstrual phase, we were unable to obtain a baseline body mass at the start of the hydration intervention; thus, body mass change in HYPO was calculated using EUH body mass. As the EUH and HYPO trials within each menstrual phase were separated by at least 48 h, it is likely that the values were confounded by factors other than the change in body water content (e.g., urine and fecal losses, food and fluid consumption). Acknowledging this limitation, we obtained other measures of hydration status (i.e., Sosm, USG, copeptin, and thirst ratings) in addition to body mass change for a more accurate assessment of hydrations status. Finally, our sample size may have limited our ability to detect statistically significant menstrual phase effects on pain. As such, the effects of menstrual phase on pain require further investigation. Our study could provide a reference for future studies with a similar design to base their sample size calculations on. Nevertheless, large effect sizes (?2p
 = 0.370.55) were obtained for the main effect of hypohydration on pain, with an observed power of 0.70.9, which suggests a low probability of false negatives.

Perspectives and Significance
Our data indicate that hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women and this effect may not be reversed immediately by water ingestion. Whereas, menstrual phase (EF vs. ML) does not appear to affect pain sensitivity. These findings suggest that insufficient water intake throughout the day may exacerbate pain perception in healthy women. Given the high prevalence of hypohydration among the general population (25), future studies should investigate whether hypohydration may worsen chronic pain conditions, and the potential efficacy of maintaining adequate hydration in alleviating pain symptoms. This may be especially important for older adults, who are more likely to be hypohydrated and experience chronic pain (25, 66). For human pain researchers, controlling or measuring hydration status of participants may be important to minimize confound, as clinically and physiologically relevant tests such as the cold pressor are affected (67). Although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases after controlling for hydration status, more high-quality research is required to accurately determine whether menstrual phase does or does not affect pain sensitivity. Therefore, until a consensus on the topic has been reached, our data do not discount the need for future pain researchers to verify menstrual phase.

Mild hypohydration, caused by fluid restriction, has been shown to increase pain sensitivity in men. However, its effects on women have not been extensively studied. In this research, 14 healthy eumenorrheic women underwent a 24-hour fluid restriction and were tested for pain sensitivity during the early follicular and mid-luteal phases of their menstrual cycle. The results showed that hypohydration reduced pain tolerance and increased ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness, regardless of menstrual phase. Acute water ingestion did not reverse the negative effects of hypohydration on pain. These findings suggest that hypohydration can increase pain sensitivity in women and highlight the importance of maintaining proper hydration throughout the day.

- Mild hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women
- Menstrual phase does not influence pain sensitivity

Mild dehydration caused by not drinking enough water can make women more sensitive to pain, according to a recent study. While previous research has shown that this is true for men, the effects on women have not been well studied. In the study, 14 healthy women were asked to restrict their fluid intake for 24 hours and then tested for pain sensitivity during different phases of their menstrual cycle. The results showed that dehydration reduced their ability to tolerate pain and made pain feel more intense and unpleasant, regardless of their menstrual phase. Drinking water did not reverse the negative effects of dehydration on pain. These findings suggest that staying properly hydrated throughout the day is important for managing pain in women.

Summary:
A recent study has found that mild dehydration can increase pain sensitivity in women, regardless of their menstrual phase. The research involved 14 healthy women who underwent a 24-hour fluid restriction and were tested for pain sensitivity during different phases of their menstrual cycle. The results showed that hypohydration reduced pain tolerance and increased ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness. Acute water ingestion did not reverse the negative effects of hypohydration on pain. This study highlights the importance of maintaining proper hydration during resistance training to avoid increased pain sensitivity.",,,,seniors,"Rewrite the headline and text to include a statement of how it is relevant for the audience.

Mild dehydration can increase pain sensitivity in women, according to a recent study. The research found that 24 hours of fluid restriction reduced pain tolerance and increased ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness in 14 healthy women. The effects were observed in both the early follicular and mid-luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Acute water ingestion did not reverse the negative effects of hypohydration on pain. These findings highlight the importance of staying hydrated throughout the day, especially for seniors who may be more susceptible to dehydration. 

Summary: Mild dehydration can increase pain sensitivity in women, regardless of menstrual phase. A recent study found that 24 hours of fluid restriction reduced pain tolerance and increased ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness in healthy women. These findings emphasize the importance of staying hydrated throughout the day, especially for seniors who may be more susceptible to dehydration."
