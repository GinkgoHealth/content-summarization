Although the detrimental effects of physical inactivity (i.e., achieving insufficient amounts of weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity) (1) are widely recognized, many individuals fail to meet current physical activity guidelines because of a perceived lack of time and barriers accessing equipment and facilities (4,5). Vigorous intermittent exercise including various interventions deemed \u0093high-intensity\u0094 and \u0093sprint\u0094 interval training (HIIT and SIT, respectively) can enhance CRF and other health-related markers similar to traditional moderate-intensity continuous training (6\u00969). Although efficacious to improve fitness and health, these protocols typically require dedicated leisure time and can be difficult to implement outside controlled laboratory settings. There also is increasing appreciation for the independent effect of sedentary behavior on cardiometabolic risk (3,10,11) and the benefits of breaking up sedentary time with more frequent bouts of activity throughout the day (12\u009614).\n\nThe application of HIIT/SIT principles to more feasible and accessible forms of exercise that can improve CRF and simultaneously reduce the negative impacts of prolonged sedentary time offers a novel method to enhance health outcomes in the general population. One such strategy involves performing brief isolated bouts of vigorous exercise over the course of the day. This approach, called \u0093exercise snacks,\u0094 can obviate the requirement for specialized equipment and alleviates the need for planning and allocating leisure time for structured exercise. It can be incorporated in between or structured within activities of daily living and implemented in a home, office, or school setting. An important added benefit of exercise snacks beyond their potential to improve CRF in a practical manner (15) is that they can naturally break up periods of prolonged sitting to reduce sedentary behavior and the associated health consequences (16).\n\nSeveral recent reports have shown that exercise snacks can boost indices of cardiometabolic health in young inactive adults (15\u009618). These studies have involved relatively small numbers of participants and should be classified primarily as proof-of-concept. Nonetheless, the emerging body of research highlights the potential value of exercise snacks as an additional tool in the repertoire of strategies aimed at increasing physical activity and improving cardiometabolic health among the general population. The purpose of this review is to highlight key findings from these studies to support our novel central hypothesis that exercise snacks are a feasible, well-tolerated, and time-efficient approach to improve CRF and reduce the negative impact of sedentary behavior on cardiometabolic health.\n\nWHAT ARE EXERCISE SNACKS?\nTo our knowledge, the term \u0093exercise snacks\u0094 was first used by Dr Howard Hartley in a 2007 weekly news magazine article (https://www.newsweek.com/exercise-snack-plan-96095). A 2014 study by Francois et al. (19), which demonstrated the benefits of brief intermittent bouts of vigorous-intensity walking for glycemic control in individuals with insulin resistance, seems to be the first to use the term in a peer-reviewed article. The protocol in that original study involved an 11-min exercise session (6 \u00d7 1-min bouts with 1-min recovery periods) in addition to a 5-min warm-up and 3-min cooldown performed on three separate occasions during the day before meals (19). In contrast, more recent studies have adopted the term \u0093exercise snacks\u0094 to describe isolated bouts of vigorous exercise lasting ?1 min that are performed multiple times throughout the day (15\u009618). The brief nature of exercise bouts that correspond to the latter definition makes it challenging to gauge intensity based on most traditional metrics including percentages of maximal heart rate (HR) or maximal oxygen uptake (V?O2), which may not be sensitive enough to accurately reflect the physiological demands imposed on cardiac or skeletal muscle during short bouts of vigorous activity. A similar argument can be made against the use of the Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) 6\u009620 scale in this scenario, which, to our knowledge, has not been validated for brief isolated bouts of vigorous exercise that typify exercise snacks. Rather, for the purpose of characterizing exercise snacks, it seems most practical to gauge relative effort, which in our published articles has resulted typically in mean values close to or greater than 5 \u0097 or a \u0093hard\u0094 effort \u0097 on the Borg category ratio 10 (CR10) scale (15\u009617). As such, although our focus is on studies that fit this definition, we acknowledge the health benefits conferred by other practical variations of brief activity breaks (12,14,20) and brief vigorous exercise that could align with concepts related to our definition of exercise snacks (19,21\u009625).\n\nTHE EFFICACY OF EXERCISE SNACKS FOR IMPROVING CRF IN INACTIVE ADULTS\nOur first exercise snacks study (15) was developed based on previous work showing a ~1 MET improvement in CRF after a 6-wk stair climbing protocol that involved 3 \u00d7 20-s hard efforts over a 10-min period performed 3 d\u00b7wk?1 (26). In the subsequent study (15), we exposed previously inactive young adults to an intervention involving either three daily bouts of vigorous stair climbing performed 1\u00964 h apart on 3 d\u00b7wk?1 or a no-exercise control (n = 12 per group) (15). For each stair-based exercise snack, participants were instructed to safely ascend 60 steps in a three-flight stairwell as quickly as possible. Each exercise snack was preceded by a dynamic warm-up (10 jumping jacks, 10 air squats, and 5 lunges on each side) and followed by a 1-min walking cooldown. After the 6-wk intervention, there were modest, albeit significant, improvements in CRF as measured using cycling V?O2peak and peak power output in the exercise snacks group as compared with control (15). CRF and peak power output values in the exercise snacks group were ~5% and ~12% higher postintervention, respectively, as compared with baseline. Of note, the vigorous exercise snacks elicited mean RPE values corresponding to a \u0093hard\u0094 effort (5 \u00b1 1 on the Borg CR10 scale) and mean HR responses equating ~85% of the age-predicted maximum over the course of the training intervention (15).\n\nThe potential for exercise snacks to improve CRF (15) was confirmed in a study involving three isolated 20-s \u0093all-out\u0094 cycling bouts (each with a 2-min warm-up and 1-min cooldown) performed 1\u00964 h apart (17). V?O2peak and time-trial performance improved by ~4% and ~9%, respectively, over a 6-wk period in a group of 12 inactive adults (17). The CRF and performance gains with cycling-based exercise snacks seemed to be similar in magnitude to those observed in participants who were randomized to a traditional SIT protocol in this study, although the study was admittedly underpowered for between-group comparisons (Fig. 1). These results suggest that the vigorous nature of these protocols may be a more important adaptive stimulus than performing successive bouts of fatiguing exercise within a short period. In support of this supposition, an isolated 10-s sprint is sufficient to alter the concentration of intramuscular metabolites (27), and a 30-s sprint activates key intracellular signaling cascades involved in mediating training adaptation (e.g., adenosine monophosphate (AMP)\u0096activated protein kinase) (28). These findings extended earlier work in 18 middle-aged females demonstrating a ~14% improvement in V?O2peak when three isolated 30-s Wingate tests undertaken 4 h apart were performed thrice weekly over an 8-wk period (29).\n\nTaken together, evidence gleaned from the aforementioned studies suggests that vigorous exercise snacks are an effective strategy to improve CRF and indices of exercise performance in previously inactive adults. Despite participants in our studies still being considered physically inactive based on the recently revised Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (i.e., by completing exercise snacks, they would not necessarily achieve 150 min of moderate-intensity or 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both each week (30)), the CRF gains conferred by the exercise snacks approach would still be expected to have health benefits (2). Importantly, for the adoption of exercise snacks by the general population outside the laboratory, the CRF gains attained using the exercise snacks approach do not require all-out efforts (15) and are apparent using both cycling-based exercise snacks and a more practical stair-based snack protocol that can be easily implemented in a home-, school-, or office-based setting.\n\nTHE FEASIBILITY OF EXERCISE SNACKS IN PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL POPULATIONS\nSedentary behavior is linked to adverse metabolic outcomes independent of CRF and physical activity levels (3,10,11), and evidence from both observational and interventional studies supports the health benefits of interrupting sedentary time with bouts of low- to moderate-intensity physical activity such as walking (12\u009614). Although these strategies effectively mitigate the cardiometabolic health defects arising from sedentary behavior, practical lifestyle approaches that break up prolonged periods of inactivity while simultaneously improving in CRF in populations at risk for, or diagnosed with, cardiometabolic disease (e.g., type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease) are presently limited. Relatedly, a large proportion of individuals in this demographic are elderly and have low physical fitness levels or other disease-related risk factors that may prevent participation in traditional forms of exercise that are typically well suited for healthy adults. Thus, there is an urgent need for feasible exercise strategies that can effectively improve cardiometabolic health in these populations.\n\nRecent work from our laboratory supports the feasibility and efficacy of vigorous exercise snacks to disrupt prolonged periods of inactivity and improve cardiometabolic health markers in preclinical and clinical populations. Using a randomized crossover design, we demonstrated that breaking up 9 h of sitting with hourly bouts of vigorous stair-based exercise snacks (~15\u009630 s) significantly reduced the area under the curve for insulin by ~17% and nonesterified fatty acids by ~21% in 11 adults with overweight/obesity (Fig. 2) (16). Unlike our previous studies (15,17), we opted not to include a warm-up and cooldown in this study to capture what an exercise snack may look like in the real world. These preliminary findings are reinforced by a recent study from Wolfe et al. (31) that reported improvements in some measures of metabolic control when 8 h of continuous sitting was compared with a condition where participants performed 5 \u00d7 4-second maximal cycling sprints on a specialized ergometer, once per hour. Breaking up prolonged sitting with hourly sprints resulted in a ~31% reduction in postprandial plasma triglycerides and 43% increase in fat oxidation after the consumption of a high-fat meal on the morning after the experimental trial (31). The exercise protocol was not strictly an exercise snacks study per our definition here, however, because it involved a total of 20 s of maximal intensity cycling over ~4\u00965 min once per hour. Other reports also show the feasibility of short practical bouts of stair-based vigorous exercise in individuals with type 2 diabetes (32) and coronary artery disease (33,34), and research into the potential of exercise snacks for improving metabolic outcomes in clinical populations represents a promising avenue for future work. It will also be of interest to examine how the more vigorous exercise snacks approach discussed here compares to breaking up prolonged sitting with frequent light- to moderate-activity breaks \u0097 an approach that has previously demonstrated benefits for improving markers of metabolic control in individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes (12,14,20,35).\n\nTHE POTENTIAL FOR EXERCISE SNACKS TO IMPROVE VASCULAR HEALTH\nIn addition to causing metabolic disruptions, prolonged sitting also reduces leg blood flow and shear stress \u0097 factors implicated in endothelial dysfunction and the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (36,37). The detrimental effects of sedentary behavior on vascular function can be mitigated when exercise is undertaken before (38), during (39), or immediately after (40) an extended bout of prolonged sitting. In this regard, recent work from our laboratory also supports the potential for exercise snacks to improve vascular function during extended periods of sitting. Caldwell et al. (18) exposed 10 healthy males to ~8.5 h of sitting with or without hourly stair-based exercise snacks involving ~14\u009620 s of ascending three flights of stairs at a brisk speed. Significant improvements in femoral artery hemodynamics, but not flow-mediated dilation (FMD), were apparent when prolonged sitting was interrupted with hourly exercise snacks, as reflected by ~32% higher blood flow and vascular conductance and a ~15% increase in shear rate (18) (Fig. 3). Although we are unaware of other studies examining vascular function in response to the exercise snacks approach as defined here, our work is supported by recent observations of improved popliteal artery blood flow and shear rate in healthy adults when a postprandial 4-h sitting period is interrupted with hourly 5-min bouts of vigorous stair climbing (23). Notably, the longer stair climbing bouts used by Cho et al. (23) also offset the reduction in FMD during prolonged sitting, suggesting that longer acute bouts of exercise may be required to elicit favorable effects on this parameter of vascular function. Taken together, these findings support the potential of exercise snacks to favorably impact vascular health, although additional studies are required to confirm the findings presented here, particularly with regard to the effects of exercise snacks on vascular and endothelial function.\n\nWHERE DO EXERCISE SNACKS FIT IN?\nExercise snacks align with the recently revised Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines on Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior (30,41). In recognition of the potential health benefits of short bouts of physical activity, the updated recommendations from these and other organizations eliminated the previous requirement that physical activity had to be accumulated in bouts lasting at least 10-min minimum (30,41). In line with this recommendation, other work has demonstrated the maintenance of health benefits when splitting longer sessions of continuous exercise into shorter bouts dispersed over the course of the day (42). Stamatakis et al. (43) recently proposed a framework encouraging four pillars of research to better understand the health benefits of a strategy called \u0093vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity\u0094 (VILPA). These authors define VILPA as a single session of vigorous activity (?14 or 15 on the Borg 6\u009620 scale or >6 MET) lasting no more than 5 min performed as part of activities of daily living or other lifestyle physical activities (43). Exercise snacks align closely with the VILPA framework in terms of their brevity, intensity, and accessibility but are technically distinct. First, unlike VILPA, exercise snacks are not purely incidental to, or inherently part of, activities of daily living but rather can be planned or structured within lifestyle activities \u0097 a distinction that still preserves the important aspects of feasibility and accessibility upon which VILPA is based. Exercise snacks also embody key elements of exercise that are not necessarily part of VILPA \u0097 namely, structure (?1 min in duration and performed as a hard effort), planning (required some anticipation or decision making), repetition (must be performed multiple times over the day), and intention (performed for the improvement of cardiometabolic health) \u0097 further distinguishing them from the VILPA approach. Nonetheless, it becomes somewhat difficult to delineate between a purposeful exercise snack embedded within activities of daily living \u0097 for instance, vigorously ascending the stairs to use the restroom on a different floor in an office building or performing a set of jumping jacks during a break between virtual meetings \u0097 and lifestyle approaches such as incidental VILPA (e.g., carrying groceries up several flights of stairs, maximizing walking pace to the bus stop). Relatedly, although exercise snacks are sometimes compared as a more practical alternative to SIT (17), the health benefits of exercise snacks do not require \u0093all out\u0094 efforts and can be achieved without the use of specialized cycle ergometers (15,16,18) \u0097 both of which are typical components of traditional SIT protocols. As such, we believe it is most appropriate to classify exercise snacks as a distinct subset of brief vigorous exercise (6), but we also recognize that \u0097 as with most things in science \u0097 the concept of exercise snacks proposed here is not necessarily new but rather may be an alternative iteration of an idea that has likely been presented by others in different contexts, both in the past and present.\n\nFUTURE DIRECTIONS\nWe have proposed a working definition of exercise snacks based on the existing literature, but also recognize the need to balance establishing a more standardized definition with the pragmaticism of avoiding hard cutoffs that draw the line at distinct intensities, durations, or numbers of isolated, short bouts of exercise within the exercise snacking concept. Ultimately, our intention is not to advocate for strictly defined terminology but rather to highlight the overall concept that isolated bouts of brief vigorous exercise represent an additional lifestyle approach to improve cardiometabolic health. With this in mind, it is entirely possible that others may view this approach as a physical activity strategy as opposed to an exercise protocol per se and, thus, choose to use terminology that differs from that implemented here (e.g., activity snacks). The decision to use the term \u0093exercise\u0094 (as opposed to \u0093activity\u0094) snacks for the purpose of this article was to maintain consistency with our published work in the area and because the approach presented in this article embodies key aspects of exercise in that it is planned, structured, repetitive, and intended for the purpose of improving cardiometabolic health. Other researchers have used variations of the term \u0093exercise snacks\u0094 to describe protocols that deviate slightly from our proposed definition but still may yield important benefits for cardiometabolic health (19,24,44). As such, the exact characteristics of exercise snacks required to maximize health benefits are yet to be determined, but it does seem that a single isolated daily 20-s sprint may not be sufficient to increase CRF in young healthy adults (45).\n\nA standardized definition could also help better understand this novel exercise approach given the similarities between exercise snacks and other forms of brief vigorous activity such as VILPA or low-volume SIT (6,43,46). However, characterizing the intensity, duration, or mode of exercise snacks based on established exercise prescription guidelines (e.g., American College of Sports Medicine, WHO) and principles (e.g., \u0093FITT\u0094) becomes difficult because of the short-duration, purposefully sporadic and isolated nature of this type of activity. For instance, it is possible that, when evaluating intensity using traditional metrics such as RPE, HR, or V?O2, exercise snacks may elicit values that are distinct from those observed during more common types of activity that established exercise prescription guidelines are based on. Thus, we encourage future attempts to classify exercise snacks in a manner that distinguishes them from existing physical activity and exercise paradigms and call for research validating traditional metrics for characterizing this type of activity.\n\nAnother aspect that is missing from the existing exercise snacks literature is their impact on psychological and affective responses, as these behavioral factors may be among the most important determinants of exercise participation. Little et al. (17) found no impact on exercise enjoyment after 6 wk of laboratory-based exercise snacks, but participants indicated the desire to perform exercise snacks in a \u0093real-world\u0094 setting. This again highlights the need to examine both physiological and psychological responses to exercise snacks outside the laboratory. In general, stair-based brief vigorous exercise seems to elicit favorable effects on cognition and mood in healthy young adults (47), but whether these beneficial effects persist using the exercise snacks approach as defined here remains to be determined. On a related note, qualitative measures that capture the feasibility of this approach in a setting where participants may not have adequate time or opportunity to prepare for intense activity during daily activities (e.g., by warming up or changing into active wear) should be assessed to rule out potential barriers to exercise snacks in the real world.\n\nGiven the relatively short duration and laboratory-based nature of existing exercise snacks studies, another important next step is to investigate the physiological and behavioral responses to longer exercise snacks interventions (e.g., several months to >1 year). Relatedly, as most of the existing research has involved healthy individuals, future studies should include populations at risk for cardiometabolic disease (e.g., preclinical/clinical populations, elderly individuals) to assess comprehensively the feasibility and efficacy of the exercise snacks approach. A plausible concern with the implementation of any vigorous exercise strategy in the real world is the potential of injury \u0097 particularly in at-risk or elderly populations. This highlights another outcome that should be addressed when attempting to translate exercise snacks outside the laboratory, albeit in a manner that balances the potential risk of injury with the numerous health benefits highlighted here and the detrimental effects of inactivity itself.\n\nLastly, the aerobically conditioning nature of the exercise snacks in the studies discussed here favor improvements in CRF, but the exercise snacks approach may be additionally attractive if geared toward improving muscular strength and endurance. A pilot study by Perkin et al. (24) reported improvements in functional capacity (sit to stand score) in older adults who participated in a 28-d home-based intervention involving two daily bouts of body weight exercise involving 5 \u00d7 1-min bouts of maximum repetitions. At the molecular level, brief vigorous bouts of stair climbing improved fiber-specific satellite cell content and myonuclei number as well as indices of capillarization in patients with coronary artery disease over a 12-wk period (33). However, because neither of these studies involved isolated bouts of exercise using an exercise snacks approach, whether these changes in muscle function and phenotype would manifest in response to exercise snacks requires confirmation in future work. Future research also should probe the mechanistic basis of the adaptive response to exercise snacks, which \u0097 similar to other forms of brief vigorous exercise \u0097 likely involves muscular oxidative remodeling mediated by activation of canonical intracellular signaling pathways (e.g., AMP-activated protein kinase) and transcriptional regulators (e.g., peroxisome proliferative activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha) (48\u009650).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe persistence of insufficient physical activity levels and sedentary lifestyles among the general population in modern Western societies highlights the ongoing need for feasible exercise strategies that simultaneously improve CRF and reduce the impact of sedentariness on cardiometabolic health. Based on the emerging evidence presented in this article, we propose that exercise snacks \u0097 defined here as isolated bouts of brief vigorous exercise performed multiple times throughout the day \u0097 may be one such strategy (Fig. 4). Exercise snacks involving thrice daily ~15\u009630 s of hard effort involving cycling and more practical stair climbing are efficacious for improving CRF and exercise performance in inactive adults. Exercise snacks may also have potential to improve aspects of cardiometabolic health in individuals with obesity, but their efficacy in clinical populations remains to be established as existing reports have studied a small number of participants in laboratory-based settings. Relatedly \u0097 and perhaps most importantly \u0097 the applicability of exercise snacks in a \u0093real-world\u0094 (e.g., in home-, office-, or work-based) setting and the potential for exercise snacks to target musculoskeletal health remain to be determined.\n\nPage 1 of 1\n\n", "folder": "2023-06-14 full2", "system_role": "You are a journalist writing content based on science research articles.", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 1000, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613", "qna": {"date": "2023-06-14 1713", "folder": "2023-06-14 full2", "article_title": "Exercise Snacks A Novel Strategy to Improve Cardiometabolic Health", "system_role": "You are a journalist writing content based on science research articles.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613", "text": "Exercise Snacks A Novel Strategy to Improve Cardiometabolic Health\n\nABSTRACT\nWe define exercise snacks as isolated ?1-min bouts of vigorous exercise performed periodically throughout the day.

These findings extended earlier work in 18 middle-aged females demonstrating a ~14% improvement in V?O2peak when three isolated 30-s Wingate tests undertaken 4 h apart were performed thrice weekly over an 8-wk period (29).\n\nTaken together, evidence gleaned from the aforementioned studies suggests that vigorous exercise snacks are an effective strategy to improve CRF and indices of exercise performance in previously inactive adults. Despite participants in our studies still being considered physically inactive based on the recently revised Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (i.e., by completing exercise snacks, they would not necessarily achieve 150 min of moderate-intensity or 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both each week (30)), the CRF gains conferred by the exercise snacks approach would still be expected to have health benefits (2). Importantly, for the adoption of exercise snacks by the general population outside the laboratory, the CRF gains attained using the exercise snacks approach do not require all-out efforts (15) and are apparent using both cycling-based exercise snacks and a more practical stair-based snack protocol that can be easily implemented in a home-, school-, or office-based setting.\n\nTHE FEASIBILITY OF EXERCISE SNACKS IN PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL POPULATIONS\nSedentary behavior is linked to adverse metabolic outcomes independent of CRF and physical activity levels (3,10,11), and evidence from both observational and interventional studies supports the health benefits of interrupting sedentary time with bouts of low- to moderate-intensity physical activity such as walking (12\u009614). Although these strategies effectively mitigate the cardiometabolic health defects arising from sedentary behavior, practical lifestyle approaches that break up prolonged periods of inactivity while simultaneously improving in CRF in populations at risk for, or diagnosed with, cardiometabolic disease (e.g., type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease) are presently limited. Relatedly, a large proportion of individuals in this demographic are elderly and have low physical fitness levels or other disease-related risk factors that may prevent participation in traditional forms of exercise that are typically well suited for healthy adults. Thus, there is an urgent need for feasible exercise strategies that can effectively improve cardiometabolic health in these populations.\n\nRecent work from our laboratory supports the feasibility and efficacy of vigorous exercise snacks to disrupt prolonged periods of inactivity and improve cardiometabolic health markers in preclinical and clinical populations. Using a randomized crossover design, we demonstrated that breaking up 9 h of sitting with hourly bouts of vigorous stair-based exercise snacks (~15\u009630 s) significantly reduced the area under the curve for insulin by ~17% and nonesterified fatty acids by ~21% in 11 adults with overweight/obesity (Fig. 2) (16). Unlike our previous studies (15,17), we opted not to include a warm-up and cooldown in this study to capture what an exercise snack may look like in the real world. These preliminary findings are reinforced by a recent study from Wolfe et al. (31) that reported improvements in some measures of metabolic control when 8 h of continuous sitting was compared with a condition where participants performed 5 \u00d7 4-second maximal cycling sprints on a specialized ergometer, once per hour. Breaking up prolonged sitting with hourly sprints resulted in a ~31% reduction in postprandial plasma triglycerides and 43% increase in fat oxidation after the consumption of a high-fat meal on the morning after the experimental trial (31). The exercise protocol was not strictly an exercise snacks study per our definition here, however, because it involved a total of 20 s of maximal intensity cycling over ~4\u00965 min once per hour. Other reports also show the feasibility of short practical bouts of stair-based vigorous exercise in individuals with type 2 diabetes (32) and coronary artery disease (33,34), and research into the potential of exercise snacks for improving metabolic outcomes in clinical populations represents a promising avenue for future work. It will also be of interest to examine how the more vigorous exercise snacks approach discussed here compares to breaking up prolonged sitting with frequent light- to moderate-activity breaks \u0097 an approach that has previously demonstrated benefits for improving markers of metabolic control in individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes (12,14,20,35).\n\nTHE POTENTIAL FOR EXERCISE SNACKS TO IMPROVE VASCULAR HEALTH\nIn addition to causing metabolic disruptions, prolonged sitting also reduces leg blood flow and shear stress \u0097 factors implicated in endothelial dysfunction and the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (36,37). The detrimental effects of sedentary behavior on vascular function can be mitigated when exercise is undertaken before (38), during (39), or immediately after (40) an extended bout of prolonged sitting. In this regard, recent work from our laboratory also supports the potential for exercise snacks to improve vascular function during extended periods of sitting. Caldwell et al. (18) exposed 10 healthy males to ~8.5 h of sitting with or without hourly stair-based exercise snacks involving ~14\u009620 s of ascending three flights of stairs at a brisk speed. Significant improvements in femoral artery hemodynamics, but not flow-mediated dilation (FMD), were apparent when prolonged sitting was interrupted with hourly exercise snacks, as reflected by ~32% higher blood flow and vascular conductance and a ~15% increase in shear rate (18) (Fig. 3). Although we are unaware of other studies examining vascular function in response to the exercise snacks approach as defined here, our work is supported by recent observations of improved popliteal artery blood flow and shear rate in healthy adults when a postprandial 4-h sitting period is interrupted with hourly 5-min bouts of vigorous stair climbing (23). Notably, the longer stair climbing bouts used by Cho et al. (23) also offset the reduction in FMD during prolonged sitting, suggesting that longer acute bouts of exercise may be required to elicit favorable effects on this parameter of vascular function. Taken together, these findings support the potential of exercise snacks to favorably impact vascular health, although additional studies are required to confirm the findings presented here, particularly with regard to the effects of exercise snacks on vascular and endothelial function.\n\nWHERE DO EXERCISE SNACKS FIT IN?\nExercise snacks align with the recently revised Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines on Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior (30,41). In recognition of the potential health benefits of short bouts of physical activity, the updated recommendations from these and other organizations eliminated the previous requirement that physical activity had to be accumulated in bouts lasting at least 10-min minimum (30,41). In line with this recommendation, other work has demonstrated the maintenance of health benefits when splitting longer sessions of continuous exercise into shorter bouts dispersed over the course of the day (42). Stamatakis et al. (43) recently proposed a framework encouraging four pillars of research to better understand the health benefits of a strategy called \u0093vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity\u0094 (VILPA). These authors define VILPA as a single session of vigorous activity (?14 or 15 on the Borg 6\u009620 scale or >6 MET) lasting no more than 5 min performed as part of activities of daily living or other lifestyle physical activities (43). Exercise snacks align closely with the VILPA framework in terms of their brevity, intensity, and accessibility but are technically distinct. First, unlike VILPA, exercise snacks are not purely incidental to, or inherently part of, activities of daily living but rather can be planned or structured within lifestyle activities \u0097 a distinction that still preserves the important aspects of feasibility and accessibility upon which VILPA is based. Exercise snacks also embody key elements of exercise that are not necessarily part of VILPA \u0097 namely, structure (?1 min in duration and performed as a hard effort), planning (required some anticipation or decision making), repetition (must be performed multiple times over the day), and intention (performed for the improvement of cardiometabolic health) \u0097 further distinguishing them from the VILPA approach. Nonetheless, it becomes somewhat difficult to delineate between a purposeful exercise snack embedded within activities of daily living \u0097 for instance, vigorously ascending the stairs to use the restroom on a different floor in an office building or performing a set of jumping jacks during a break between virtual meetings \u0097 and lifestyle approaches such as incidental VILPA (e.g., carrying groceries up several flights of stairs, maximizing walking pace to the bus stop). Relatedly, although exercise snacks are sometimes compared as a more practical alternative to SIT (17), the health benefits of exercise snacks do not require \u0093all out\u0094 efforts and can be achieved without the use of specialized cycle ergometers (15,16,18) \u0097 both of which are typical components of traditional SIT protocols. As such, we believe it is most appropriate to classify exercise snacks as a distinct subset of brief vigorous exercise (6), but we also recognize that \u0097 as with most things in science \u0097 the concept of exercise snacks proposed here is not necessarily new but rather may be an alternative iteration of an idea that has likely been presented by others in different contexts, both in the past and present.\n\nFUTURE DIRECTIONS\nWe have proposed a working definition of exercise snacks based on the existing literature, but also recognize the need to balance establishing a more standardized definition with the pragmaticism of avoiding hard cutoffs that draw the line at distinct intensities, durations, or numbers of isolated, short bouts of exercise within the exercise snacking concept. Ultimately, our intention is not to advocate for strictly defined terminology but rather to highlight the overall concept that isolated bouts of brief vigorous exercise represent an additional lifestyle approach to improve cardiometabolic health. With this in mind, it is entirely possible that others may view this approach as a physical activity strategy as opposed to an exercise protocol per se and, thus, choose to use terminology that differs from that implemented here (e.g., activity snacks). The decision to use the term \u0093exercise\u0094 (as opposed to \u0093activity\u0094) snacks for the purpose of this article was to maintain consistency with our published work in the area and because the approach presented in this article embodies key aspects of exercise in that it is planned, structured, repetitive, and intended for the purpose of improving cardiometabolic health. Other researchers have used variations of the term \u0093exercise snacks\u0094 to describe protocols that deviate slightly from our proposed definition but still may yield important benefits for cardiometabolic health (19,24,44). As such, the exact characteristics of exercise snacks required to maximize health benefits are yet to be determined, but it does seem that a single isolated daily 20-s sprint may not be sufficient to increase CRF in young healthy adults (45).\n\nA standardized definition could also help better understand this novel exercise approach given the similarities between exercise snacks and other forms of brief vigorous activity such as VILPA or low-volume SIT (6,43,46). However, characterizing the intensity, duration, or mode of exercise snacks based on established exercise prescription guidelines (e.g., American College of Sports Medicine, WHO) and principles (e.g., \u0093FITT\u0094) becomes difficult because of the short-duration, purposefully sporadic and isolated nature of this type of activity. For instance, it is possible that, when evaluating intensity using traditional metrics such as RPE, HR, or V?O2, exercise snacks may elicit values that are distinct from those observed during more common types of activity that established exercise prescription guidelines are based on. Thus, we encourage future attempts to classify exercise snacks in a manner that distinguishes them from existing physical activity and exercise paradigms and call for research validating traditional metrics for characterizing this type of activity.\n\nAnother aspect that is missing from the existing exercise snacks literature is their impact on psychological and affective responses, as these behavioral factors may be among the most important determinants of exercise participation. Little et al. (17) found no impact on exercise enjoyment after 6 wk of laboratory-based exercise snacks, but participants indicated the desire to perform exercise snacks in a \u0093real-world\u0094 setting. This again highlights the need to examine both physiological and psychological responses to exercise snacks outside the laboratory. In general, stair-based brief vigorous exercise seems to elicit favorable effects on cognition and mood in healthy young adults (47), but whether these beneficial effects persist using the exercise snacks approach as defined here remains to be determined. On a related note, qualitative measures that capture the feasibility of this approach in a setting where participants may not have adequate time or opportunity to prepare for intense activity during daily activities (e.g., by warming up or changing into active wear) should be assessed to rule out potential barriers to exercise snacks in the real world.\n\nGiven the relatively short duration and laboratory-based nature of existing exercise snacks studies, another important next step is to investigate the physiological and behavioral responses to longer exercise snacks interventions (e.g., several months to >1 year). Relatedly, as most of the existing research has involved healthy individuals, future studies should include populations at risk for cardiometabolic disease (e.g., preclinical/clinical populations, elderly individuals) to assess comprehensively the feasibility and efficacy of the exercise snacks approach. A plausible concern with the implementation of any vigorous exercise strategy in the real world is the potential of injury \u0097 particularly in at-risk or elderly populations. This highlights another outcome that should be addressed when attempting to translate exercise snacks outside the laboratory, albeit in a manner that balances the potential risk of injury with the numerous health benefits highlighted here and the detrimental effects of inactivity itself.\n\nLastly, the aerobically conditioning nature of the exercise snacks in the studies discussed here favor improvements in CRF, but the exercise snacks approach may be additionally attractive if geared toward improving muscular strength and endurance. A pilot study by Perkin et al. (24) reported improvements in functional capacity (sit to stand score) in older adults who participated in a 28-d home-based intervention involving two daily bouts of body weight exercise involving 5 \u00d7 1-min bouts of maximum repetitions. At the molecular level, brief vigorous bouts of stair climbing improved fiber-specific satellite cell content and myonuclei number as well as indices of capillarization in patients with coronary artery disease over a 12-wk period (33). However, because neither of these studies involved isolated bouts of exercise using an exercise snacks approach, whether these changes in muscle function and phenotype would manifest in response to exercise snacks requires confirmation in future work. Future research also should probe the mechanistic basis of the adaptive response to exercise snacks, which \u0097 similar to other forms of brief vigorous exercise \u0097 likely involves muscular oxidative remodeling mediated by activation of canonical intracellular signaling pathways (e.g., AMP-activated protein kinase) and transcriptional regulators (e.g., peroxisome proliferative activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha) (48\u009650).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe persistence of insufficient physical activity levels and sedentary lifestyles among the general population in modern Western societies highlights the ongoing need for feasible exercise strategies that simultaneously improve CRF and reduce the impact of sedentariness on cardiometabolic health. Based on the emerging evidence presented in this article, we propose that exercise snacks \u0097 defined here as isolated bouts of brief vigorous exercise performed multiple times throughout the day \u0097 may be one such strategy (Fig. 4). Exercise snacks involving thrice daily ~15\u009630 s of hard effort involving cycling and more practical stair climbing are efficacious for improving CRF and exercise performance in inactive adults. Exercise snacks may also have potential to improve aspects of cardiometabolic health in individuals with obesity, but their efficacy in clinical populations remains to be established as existing reports have studied a small number of participants in laboratory-based settings. Relatedly \u0097 and perhaps most importantly \u0097 the applicability of exercise snacks in a \u0093real-world\u0094 (e.g., in home-, office-, or work-based) setting and the potential for exercise snacks to target musculoskeletal health remain to be determined.\n\nPage 1 of 1\n\n", "prep step": "Think about why this might be relevant for the audience in the grand scheme of things.    \nIdentify 1 or 2 key concepts from this article that would make interesting or helpful health content.

However, subjective and biobehavioral processes that may increase HP overeating are not clear. Using a novel experimental approach, we examined HP food motivation and intake and neuroendocrine responses in the context of food cues, stress and a control neutral relaxing cue exposure in healthy individuals.\nMethods:\nTwenty individuals (12M; 8F; ages 18-45) with body mass index (BMI) in the lean (LN: N=8; 3/8 female BMI: 18-24.9) or overweight/obese (OW: N=12; 5/12 female; BMI: 25-37) range were enrolled in a controlled, hospital-based, 3-day laboratory experiment. On each day, subjects were exposed to a brief 5-minute individualized guided imagery of stress, food cue or an active neutral-relaxing control cue script, followed by a food snack test (FST), with one imagery condition per day and order of imagery exposure randomized and counterbalanced across subjects. Subjective HP food craving and caloric intake, anxiety, cortisol and total ghrelin was assessed repeatedly during each test day.\nResults:\nSignificant condition and condition X group effects for food craving, anxiety and HP calorie intake were observed, with food cue relative to neutral condition increasing HP food craving and intake across all subjects (p<.001), but stress relative to neutral condition increased HP food craving and intake in the OW but not LN group (p<. 01). Pre-snack increases in food craving after exposure to food cues and to stress predicted greater subsequent HP food intake (p\u0092s<.01). Furthermore, ghrelin increased in the food cue and stress conditions (p< .01), but stress-induced increases in ghrelin was associated with HP food intake only in the OW/OB condition (p<.01). Finally, cortisol increased during food cue exposure and increased cortisol responses were associated with greater HP food caving and with intake (p\u0092s<.05).\nConclusions:\nThese findings, while preliminary, validate a laboratory model of HP food motivation and intake and identify specific subjective and neuroendocrine responses that may play a role in HP snacking with implications for weight gain and obesity risk.\nKeywords:\u00a0Food cues, stress, food craving, cortisol, ghrelin, highly palatable food intake\nGo to:\nINTRODUCTION\nThe United States is at the forefront of the global obesity epidemic with 67% of its population classified as overweight or obese (body mass index (BMI) ? 25kg/m2) [1-3]. Despite the epidemic and its significant adverse medical sequelae [2,\u00a03], mechanisms driving such increases in obesity are not well understood. Overeating of highly palatable (HP) foods in the ubiquitous HP food cue environment and in stressful life contexts are known to contribute to weight gain and obesity risk [4-6], but underlying processes in these environmental contexts that promote overeating in humans is not well understood.\nHighly palatable (HP) foods are more liked, preferred and found to be rewarding in taste relative to less palatable foods. These HP foods include those high in sugar, with sweet taste, highly processed foods high in saturated fats or high carbohydrates making up savory tastes and combination of food groups prepared in ways that enhance taste and value or \u0091salience\u0092 of such foods to an individual. These foods are ubiquitous in our current obesogenic environment, and such highly palatable and processed foods and their related associations or\u0091cues\u0092 stimulate the brain reward and motivation pathways similar to reinforcing drugs of abuse, and via learning/conditioning mechanisms increase the likelihood of HP food seeking and consumption [4,\u00a07-11]. These HP foods are also associated with increased food cravings and intake [12], and consumption of fast foods such as potato chips, processed meats, sugar sweetened beverages all predict long term weight gain in large prospective cohorts of US men and women [13]. Despite such evidence that conditioned properties of HP foods increases greater food craving and promotes their intake, there are few experimental studies that examine the biobehavioral processes that may promote HP food craving and intake.\nStressful environments are also associated with greater food intake [14-16] and chronic stress levels are associated with greater weight gain and obesity risk [6,\u00a017-19]. Stressful experiences may increase demand for energy and promote gluconeogenesis and energy intake, that may also increase risk of higher food craving and intake [20]. Previous experimental studies assessing acute stress exposure effects on food intake have reported variable results [21-25]. While some research shows stress exposure increases high calorie food intake [17,\u00a024,\u00a026], others have shown reduced food intake with acute stress exposure in people with obesity [23,\u00a027]. However, this research varies by a number of experimental factors, including type of acute stressor utilized in the experiment, weight status of the participants, and type of food presented for intake and exposure time for food intake. More importantly, they have largely not addressed motivational status of the individual, i.e., food cravings, and whether stress increases food craving to promote HP food intake.\nBuilding on the previous literature from addiction models, where stress and drug cues each promote drug craving and facilitate risk of increased drug use [18], we conducted a preliminary experimental study to assess whether exposure to acute stress and HP food cues each increase food craving and intake in healthy lean and overweight individuals. We utilized a previously well-validated and extensively utilized individualized guided imagery method [28-35] for inducing stress, food cues and control neutral relaxing state in the laboratory. This was followed by assessment of HP food craving and intake in a food snack test (FST) after each exposure. Furthermore, as both cortisol and ghrelin have been associated with stress and with HP food intake [36,\u00a037], and are also altered by high BMI status [38], these hormones were repeatedly assessed throughout the study. We hypothesized that food cue and stress will each increase HP food cravings relative to the neutral control condition and that such increases in HP food craving will predict subsequent HP food intake. Furthermore, we hypothesized that significant changes in cortisol and ghrelin during food cue and with stress exposure, will be associated with HP food craving and intake.\nGo to:\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nScreening and Intake Procedures\nHealthy, non-smoking, non-substance using volunteers (12 men; 8 women; aged 18-45) were recruited from a community cohort of volunteers recruited from the greater New Haven area via flyers, radio, and social media advertisements. All volunteers completed medical, demographic, health assessments, including the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV-TR [39], Participants were excluded if they were cigarette smokers, had BMI above 38 due to risk of morbid obesity-related adverse health conditions, reported current dieting, met current DSM-IV-TR\u00a0dependence\u00a0criteria for any substance use disorders, or current other psychiatric disorders, including current eating disorders, had any current medical conditions and illnesses or if they were taking any medications. From 54 volunteers screened for this study, 16 were ineligible pertaining to these exclusions, while the others declined participation due to time constraints and changing their mind. Participants underwent breath alcohol testing, carbon monoxide testing, and urine toxicology screens to confirm being drug-free at each study appointment. Women who were pregnant, lactating or were on oral contraceptives as well as those who were peri or post-menopausal were also excluded. Participants received a physical examination by the admitting physician (JBG) to ensure all participants were in good health. Participants provided written informed consent and the study was approved by the Human Investigation Committee of the Yale University School of Medicine.\nScript Development and Imagery Training\nPrior to participation in the experimental procedures, all subjects participated in a structured interview session for imagery script development for the provocation of stress, food cue and control neutral relaxing contexts for the later laboratory experiment, as per our previously validated methods and structured manualized procedures [30,\u00a032,\u00a033,\u00a035,\u00a040]. Briefly, the stress imagery script was based on participants\u0092 descriptions of a recent personally stressful event which made them \u0093sad, mad, or upset, and with little control over the situation in the moment,\u0094 and that was experienced as \u0093most stressful.\u0094 \u0093Most stressful\u0094 was determined by assessing perceived stress on a 10-point Likert scale where 1 = not at all stressful and 10 = the most stress they felt in the past year. Individual calibration of stressful situations was conducted by only accepting situations rated as 8 or above as appropriate for script development. Stressful situations involving food intake or eating contexts were not allowed. The food cue scripts were developed by participants identifying a recent situation that included their favorite HP food-related stimuli and subsequent intake of those HP foods. Favorite food intake situations that were associated with negative affect or psychological distress were not allowed. A neutral-relaxing, non-physiologically arousing, and non-food related script was developed from the participants\u0092 description of a personally relaxing situation to serve as a control condition (See\u00a0Appendix A\u00a0for sample imagery scripts).\nImagery Training and Habituation Session:\u00a0\nParticipants were also provided with training in progressive relaxation and mental imagery in a 40 minute session prior to experimental sessions on Day 1 of admission as described below. During this session, an Intravenous (IV) heparin-treated catheter was inserted by the research nurse in the antecubital region of the participant\u0092s non-preferred arm for the participant to habituate to any potential stress of the IV insertion. No blood was drawn during this training session. The procedures for the training are outlined in the imagery training manual [40] and in previous work [30]. Briefly the progressive muscle relaxation procedure involved learning to monitor the tension in specific muscle groups by first tensing each muscle group, then releasing the tension, while directing attention towards the differences felt during tension and relaxation.\nExperimental Procedures:\nParticipants were admitted for a three-day, 2-night stay at the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation-Hospital Research Unit (HRU) located at the Yale New Haven Hospital, to ensure a controlled environment during the 3-day experiment. Upon admission on day 1, subjects were trained in progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery and habituated to the IV insertion, as per our previous work and as outlined in the personalized imagery procedures training manual [40]. On each experimental day, participants were brought into the testing room at 2:00PM, after eating a standard healthy lunch at noon. A heparin-treated catheter was inserted by the research nurse in the antecubital region of the participant\u0092s non-preferred arm. A 45-minute adaptation period followed, after which baseline plasma samples were drawn and subjective anxiety and food craving assessments were conducted before and after a 20 minute progressive relaxation procedure. Next, participants were provided with headphones and exposed to an audio recording of the 5-minute personalized guided imagery script of either their stress, food cue, or neutral-relaxing scenarios, only one condition per day in a randomized and counterbalanced order of presentation across subjects. We instructed participants to:\u00a0\u0093Close your eyes and imagine the situation being described, \u0091as if\u0092 it were happening right now. Let your body and mind get completely involved in the situation, doing what you would do in the real situation.\u0094\u00a0Immediately following imagery exposure on each day, and after blood draws and assessments, participants were presented with the food snack test (FST) which comprised 4 bowls of HP snacks of one each of chocolate pudding, potato chips, popcorn and mini chocolate chip cookies, and two bowls of healthy snacks of baby carrots and grapes, each portioned to ~500 calories (3000 calories per lab session). The presentation of the FST with HP foods serves as discrete HP food cues presented after imagery to assess effects on food motivation prior to food intake. Participants were then provided with the following instructions:\u00a0\u0093There are 6 bowls of different snacks on the tray. We will leave these here for the next hour and you can eat as much or as little as you like during the next hour\u0094.\u00a0All subjects were also videotaped for observed eating behavior coding. During this period, participants were not allowed to watch movies or do other activities but did have access to their phones. At the end of the hour, the tray was removed and the total calories consumed from each bowl of HP and healthy snacks was measured after each session as a measure of behavioral HP food motivation and intake. Food craving, anxiety, bloods draws for cortisol and ghrelin assessments were made at repeated timepoints throughout the session (Figure 1). All research staff were blind to the condition on each day as audiotapes were only marked by day and not by condition, which allowed for all assessments being conducted in a blinded manner.\nDependent Measures\nHP Food Craving\u00a0\nA brief 6-item food craving scale (FCS) was derived from the well-validated\u00a0Food Craving Inventory\u00a0(FCI, [41]), and included highly rated select high sugar, carbohydrate and fat items, for repeated assessment of food craving in an experimental setting. The specific FCI items rated included in the laboratory FCS were pizza, brownie, chocolate, cookies, ice cream and steak (on a 7 point scale). A total HP food craving score (sum of ratings) was computed at each timepoint of assessment as shown in\u00a0Figure 1.\nSubjective Anxiety Ratings\u00a0\nSubjective anxiety was rated on a 11-point scale anchored at 0 for \u0093not at all\u0094 and 10 for \u0093extremely anxious\u0094 measured at each assessment timepoint per session as shown in\u00a0Figure 1.\nMeasurement of Cortisol and Ghrelin\u00a0\nPlasma samples (8 mL) were collected at the same 8 consecutive time-points as food craving on each day (Figure 1). All plasma samples were collected in heparinized tubes that were immediately placed on ice after drawing. Within 30 minutes of collection, the blood was centrifuged at 4\u00b0C and the plasma was pooled and aliquoted for cortisol and for total ghrelin assays. All tubes were stored at ?70\u00b0C and analyzed using standard radioimmunoassay procedures as reported previously [19,\u00a031].\nFood Snack Test (FST) Calories Consumed:\u00a0\nAll snacks were carefully weighed and 500 calories of the snack foods of chocolate pudding, potato chips, popcorn, mini chocolate chip cookies, baby carrots and grapes were portioned into their respective bowls prior to each session as shown in\u00a0Figure 1. After the one-hour snacking period in each session, the amount of food snack consumed from each bowl was computed and the calories for each food was recorded, with a maximum of 500 calories per bowl for a total of 3000 calories for each laboratory session per day. HP food calories was a sum of the chocolate chip cookies, chocolate pudding, popcorn and potato chips, while the healthy food calories comprised the sum of calories of baby carrots and grapes consumed on each day.\nData Analytic Plan\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (SAS, Version 9.3) and all figures were created with GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).\nWe used Linear mixed effect (LME) models with a compound symmetry matrix structure for all analyses. The study design included the Between-Subjects factor of BMI [Lean(LN): below 25; Overweight/Obese(OW): 25-28] and Within-Subjects repeated factors, of Condition (Food cue, stress, neutral-relaxing) and Timepoint (baseline before imagery(?5), immediately following imagery(0), pre-snack timepoint prior to FST(+15), and 4 additional timepoints during ((+30, +45, +60) and post (+75) FST). Using these models, we tested the effects of BMI and Condition (food cue, stress relative to neutral cues) on food craving, cortisol, ghrelin and FST intake across time points. LME models in SAS also provide simple effects estimates with corresponding t-tests to deconstruct significant main effects and interactions. The specific contrasts were Stress (S) relative to neutral (N), Food Cue (FC) relative to N, and FC relative to N to deconstruct Condition main effects. In addition, BMI X Condition interaction effects were deconstructed with Condition effects as outlined above for each BMI group, and also for each Condition contrasting BMI groups, i.e., LN: S-N, FC-N, FC-S; OW: S-N, FC-N, FC-S; and LN vs. OW for S, FC and N conditions. In addition, Pearson product-moment correlation analyses were conducted to assess the relationship of pre-snacking food craving, cortisol and ghrelin and amount of HP food consumed during the FST.\nGo to:\nRESULTS\nThe subject sample comprised 12 men and 8 women, with 8 individuals with BMI\u0092s in the lean (LN; 38% women) and 12 in the overweight/obese (OWOB - BMI: 25-38; 42% women) range, with a mean age of 31.35 (SD: 7.39), mean education level of 15.2 years (SD: 2.07), mean IQ of 111.4 (SD:7.9), who were 35% Caucasian, 35% African American, 20% Hispanic and 10% Other. There were no differences between BMI groups on any of these demographic characteristics.\nPre-Snack HP Food Craving (FCS) and Subjective Anxiety Ratings:\nFor\u00a0subjective HP food craving, a significant effect of Condition (F(2,36)=12.74, p<.0001) and BMI Group X Condition (F(2,36)=4.93, p<.02) was observed. Simple effects t-test analyses indicated significantly higher food craving in the food cue relative to neutral (FC > N: t=4.92, p<.0001) and relative to stress(FC>S: t=3.45, p<.001). Simple effects for the BMI X Condition effect revealed the lean (LN) group showing greater craving only in the food cue relative to neutral condition (t=4.66, p<.0001), but the OW group showing food craving increases in both the food cue (t=2.27, p<.04) and in the stress (t=2.01, p<.05) relative to neutral conditions (see\u00a0Figure 2a).\nFor\u00a0HP FST intake, a main effect of Condition (F(2,36)=3.86, p<.03) was observed, indicating significantly higher levels of HP food calories consumed in the food cue (t=2.99, p<.01) relative to the neutral condition (Figure 2b). A trend level interaction of BMI Group X Condition (F(2,36)=3.31, p<.08) was also observed, resulting from greater HP food calories (HP FCAL) consumed in the food cue relative to neutral condition for the Lean (t=2.14, p<.04) only, but higher HPF CAL consumed in the stress condition for the OW relative to the LN group (t= 1.91, p<.05) (see\u00a0Figure 2b).\nFor\u00a0subjective anxiety, a significant effect of Condition (F(2,36)=8.7, p<.0008) and BMI Group X Condition (F(2,36)=3.71, p<.03) was observed. Simple effect contrasts revealed overall significantly higher anxiety in the food cue (t=2.02, p<.05) and in stress (t=2.11, p<.04) relative to the neutral condition, but this arose from the people with Lean BMIs showing no significant increases in anxiety across any condition, but the people with OW/OB BMIs showing increased anxiety in the food cue (t=2.10, p<.03) and in the stress (t=4.35, p<.001) relative to the neutral condition (see\u00a0Figure 2c).\nRelationship between Pre-Snack HP Food Craving and HP FST Calorie Consumed:\nPre-FST food craving scores (FCS_PreSnack) were found to be highly correlated with subsequent HP food calories (HPF_CAL) consumed in the food cue (r=.82, p<.0001) condition across groups but not in the neutral condition (r=.31, p<.18). On the other hand, stress-induced food craving predicted HP FST intake only in the OW group but not in the Lean group (OW: r=.68, p<.02; LN: r=.55, p<.12) (see\u00a0Figure 3a\u00a0-\u00a0?-3c3c).\nTotal Ghrelin Response and Relationship to HP Food Craving and Intake\nOverall LME analyses revealed a Condition main effect (F(2,35)=5.61, p<.008), but no significant BMI Group X Condition interaction (F(2,35)=0.75, p<.48). The Condition main effect resulted from stress (t=2.88, p<.007) and food cue (t=2.97, p<.005) exposure each increasing ghrelin relative to the neutral condition (see\u00a0Figure 4a). Secondary exploratory effect of group differences showed that ghrelin increases during both stress and in food cue relative to neutral conditions was due to increases in those in the OW/OB BMI group (FC vs N: t=2.54, p<.02 S vs N: t=3.25, p<.003) and not the lean group (FC vs N: t= 1.78, p<.08; S vs N: t=1.12, p<.27) (see\u00a0Fig 4a). Association between total ghrelin increases in each condition and food craving and intake were also conducted and revealed that stress-induced, but not food cue-induced increases in ghrelin were significantly associated with HP food craving and intake, and only in the OW group (see\u00a0Figure 4b\u00a0-\u00a0?-4c4c).\nDISCUSSION\nThis preliminary study is the first to directly compare the effects of both food cue and stress exposure on HP food craving and HP food intake in a 3-day human laboratory experiment conducted within a controlled hospital-based setting with healthy community adults. As both the ubiquitous HP food environment and stressors are known to increase HP food intake and obesity risk, a direct comparison of these contexts could identify similar and differential processes that may underlie food motivation and intake. As hypothesized, and similar to our previous work in addiction [18], we found that exposure to both personal food cues and to personal stressors relative to a neutral relaxing control cue resulted in increases in HP food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods in a standardized Food Snack Test (FST), but with differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups. Furthermore, we found that increased food craving in these contexts was highly associated with subsequent amounts of HP food snack intake. Finally, both ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. Together, these results support the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.\nExposure to food cue imagery led to significant increases in HP food craving prior to the presentation of the FST at the pre-snack timepoint in both lean and OW individuals. Moreover, food cue-related increases in food craving predicted significant increases in HP snack intake across both lean and OW individuals. These data are consistent with a significant literature indicating that rewarding stimuli and their related contexts increase motivation and wanting of rewarding stimuli via conditioning and/or incentive salience mechanisms [4,\u00a020,\u00a042]. Also, a number of basic science and human neuroimaging studies have shown that food cue stimulus exposure increases food craving and activate brain reward and motivation regions [4,\u00a07-11,\u00a018,\u00a043,\u00a044]. Current findings further indicate that such food cue-related increases in HP food craving promote HP snack intake with greater intake of HP foods in the food cue context relative to the neutral relaxing contexts across individuals. These data validate the real-world contexts of advertising of HP foods to promote greater sales and intake of HP foods.\nIn contrast, we found a differential impact of stress on HP food craving and intake by BMI group where stress significantly increased food craving relative to the neutral condition, but only in the overweight and not the lean group. Furthermore, stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group, suggesting that food motivational processes may be relevant in identifying those who are vulnerable to stress-induced eating. Previous laboratory studies have shown mixed results with some showing stress increasing food intake [17,\u00a024], but others reporting no consistent increases in intake [23,\u00a045]. While the methodology has varied across these studies, current findings suggest the need for direct comparison of BMI groups and consideration of weight-related adaptations in assessing stress effects on HP food motivation and intake. Current findings are also supported by a growing literature suggesting that BMI-related alterations impact not only metabolic hormones but also stress and reward processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake [18,\u00a020,\u00a044]. Together our findings on food cue- and stress- related effects on HP food motivation and intake suggests differential effects by BMI, that may in turn, point to different mechanisms that may drive weight gain and obesity risk in individuals who are lean versus those who are overweight.\nOur findings also show differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin responses and their contribution to HP food motivation and intake. Stress and food cue exposure increased ghrelin responses, but significantly for the OW and not the LN group. Furthermore, only in the OW group was stress-induced ghrelin increases significantly associated with both HP food craving and subsequent HP food intake. While ghrelin has well known homeostatic effects on feeding function [46,\u00a047], recent focus has been on its role in both stress and mood regulation as well as in hedonically motivated feeding behavior, partially via its effects on mesolimbic reward circuits [37,\u00a048]. Findings indicate that ghrelin can shift preferences to high palatable foods and increase the motivational aspects of food reward [48]. Ghrelin is also known to increase with stress and is involved in regulating anxiety and mood (36,\u00a049-51). Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that ghrelin administration increases the neural response to food pictures in areas associated with hedonic eating (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and ventral tegmental area) [52]. Additionally, there is growing evidence that feed-forward circuitry between stress and food reward maybe partly mediated by ghrelin [52,\u00a053]. In the current study, as the effects were specific to the OW group, they suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions.\nFinally, our findings also showed differential effects of cortisol responses to stress and food cue exposure. Notably, there was a significant increase in cortisol in the food cue relative to the neutral condition that was due to significant increases in cortisol in the lean group and not so in the OW group. Furthermore, food cue-related increases in cortisol was associated with greater food cue-related HP craving, suggesting a role for cortisol in food motivation. While glucocorticoids are often associated with the stress response, they are also known to play an important role in energy intake and regulation. Cortisol increases have been noted with intake of specific macronutrients, including carbohydrates, fats and proteins in animals and humans [6,\u00a054], with the source of cortisol increases to be via both adrenal and extra-adrenal production [54]. Furthermore, in our previous neuroimaging study, increases in cortisol during a mild hypoglycemic state was associated with greater activation of brain reward regions that promoted greater food craving [44]. Together, this previous research supports current findings of the association between greater cortisol responses to food cue exposure with food cue-induced HP food craving.\nWe did not see an overall significant increase in cortisol during stress exposure, but this was largely due to a lack of response in the OW group. Remarkably, the OW group showed blunted cortisol responses during stress and food cue relative to neutral conditions. This finding is consistent with growing evidence of blunted cortisol and autonomic responses to stress challenge in people who are OW or obese, along with altered autonomic and peripheral catecholamine responses to stress challenge in those weight groups [18,\u00a021-25,\u00a055]. HPA axis adaptations with low cortisol awakening responses have been reported in higher BMI groups, along with blunted responses to stress and reduced dopamine activity [20,\u00a056]. Thus, the current findings of lack of cortisol increases in the OW group leads one to speculate that such HPA axis adaptations may contribute to higher HP food craving and intake in food cue and in stress contexts. However, this is speculation and would need further testing in future studies.\nSeveral limitations of the current study need to be considered. First, the sample size was small and thus the findings are preliminary and need further validation. Also, due to the small sample size, sex differences and differential responses within the overweight groups were not assessed. It is possible that men and women differ in their food motivation and intake responses in food cue and stress contexts as shown in previous work [26,27]. Also, continuous assessment of BMI rather than arbitrary cutoffs for individuals in the lean, overweight and obese BMI range may provide greater sensitivity in assessing weight related adaptations. Thus, research with larger samples is required to replicate current findings and address these issues. Finally, as this study was conducted while participants were in a hospital, it is not clear whether the findings are generalizable to an outpatient experimental context or to real world food motivation and intake settings. On the other hand, as food cues and stress are among the most common contexts in which overeating of HP foods occur in the real world, the current study presents a well-controlled experimental model to study the biobehavioral processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake of highly palatable foods. Evidence of HP food motivation and increased snacking in these contexts is consistent with reports of obesogenic environments promoting increased HP food intake and weight gain in the real world. Furthermore, positive associations of HP food craving and intake by total ghrelin and cortisol responses suggests a role for metabolic and neuroendocrine adaptations in increased HP food motivation and intake.\n?\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n* This paper directly compares the effects of both food cue and stress exposure on highly palatable food craving and intake in a 3-day human laboratory experiment conducted within a controlled hospital-based setting with healthy community adults.\n* Results show that food cues and stress exposure increases food craving and subsequent snacking of highly palatable foods, and food cravings predict subsequent highly palatable food intake.\n* Ghrelin and cortisol hormones appear to play a role in food cue and stress related food motivation and intake.\n* These findings suggest the need for further carefully controlled studies to understand the biobehavioral processes that drive overeating and weight gain.\n\n", "folder": "2023-06-14 full2", "system_role": "You are a journalist writing content based on science research articles.", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 1000, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613", "qna": {"date": "2023-06-14 1713", "folder": "2023-06-14 full2", "article_title": "Food craving, cortisol and ghrelin responses in modeling highly palatable snack intake in the laboratory", "system_role": "You are a journalist writing content based on science research articles.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613", "text": "Food craving, cortisol and ghrelin responses in modeling highly palatable snack intake in the laboratory\n\nAbstract\nOvereating of highly palatable (HP) foods in the ubiquitous HP food cue environment and under stress is associated with weight gain and contributes to the global obesity epidemic. However, subjective and biobehavioral processes that may increase HP overeating are not clear. Using a novel experimental approach, we examined HP food motivation and intake and neuroendocrine responses in the context of food cues, stress and a control neutral relaxing cue exposure in healthy individuals.\nMethods:\nTwenty individuals (12M; 8F; ages 18-45) with body mass index (BMI) in the lean (LN: N=8; 3/8 female BMI: 18-24.9) or overweight/obese (OW: N=12; 5/12 female; BMI: 25-37) range were enrolled in a controlled, hospital-based, 3-day laboratory experiment. On each day, subjects were exposed to a brief 5-minute individualized guided imagery of stress, food cue or an active neutral-relaxing control cue script, followed by a food snack test (FST), with one imagery condition per day and order of imagery exposure randomized and counterbalanced across subjects. Subjective HP food craving and caloric intake, anxiety, cortisol and total ghrelin was assessed repeatedly during each test day.\nResults:\nSignificant condition and condition X group effects for food craving, anxiety and HP calorie intake were observed, with food cue relative to neutral condition increasing HP food craving and intake across all subjects (p<.001), but stress relative to neutral condition increased HP food craving and intake in the OW but not LN group (p<. 01). Pre-snack increases in food craving after exposure to food cues and to stress predicted greater subsequent HP food intake (p\u0092s<.01). Furthermore, ghrelin increased in the food cue and stress conditions (p< .01), but stress-induced increases in ghrelin was associated with HP food intake only in the OW/OB condition (p<.01). Finally, cortisol increased during food cue exposure and increased cortisol responses were associated with greater HP food caving and with intake (p\u0092s<.05).\nConclusions:\nThese findings, while preliminary, validate a laboratory model of HP food motivation and intake and identify specific subjective and neuroendocrine responses that may play a role in HP snacking with implications for weight gain and obesity risk.\nKeywords:\u00a0Food cues, stress, food craving, cortisol, ghrelin, highly palatable food intake\nGo to:\nINTRODUCTION\nThe United States is at the forefront of the global obesity epidemic with 67% of its population classified as overweight or obese (body mass index (BMI) ? 25kg/m2) [1-3]. Despite the epidemic and its significant adverse medical sequelae [2,\u00a03], mechanisms driving such increases in obesity are not well understood. Overeating of highly palatable (HP) foods in the ubiquitous HP food cue environment and in stressful life contexts are known to contribute to weight gain and obesity risk [4-6], but underlying processes in these environmental contexts that promote overeating in humans is not well understood.\nHighly palatable (HP) foods are more liked, preferred and found to be rewarding in taste relative to less palatable foods. These HP foods include those high in sugar, with sweet taste, highly processed foods high in saturated fats or high carbohydrates making up savory tastes and combination of food groups prepared in ways that enhance taste and value or \u0091salience\u0092 of such foods to an individual. These foods are ubiquitous in our current obesogenic environment, and such highly palatable and processed foods and their related associations or\u0091cues\u0092 stimulate the brain reward and motivation pathways similar to reinforcing drugs of abuse, and via learning/conditioning mechanisms increase the likelihood of HP food seeking and consumption [4,\u00a07-11]. These HP foods are also associated with increased food cravings and intake [12], and consumption of fast foods such as potato chips, processed meats, sugar sweetened beverages all predict long term weight gain in large prospective cohorts of US men and women [13]. Despite such evidence that conditioned properties of HP foods increases greater food craving and promotes their intake, there are few experimental studies that examine the biobehavioral processes that may promote HP food craving and intake.\nStressful environments are also associated with greater food intake [14-16] and chronic stress levels are associated with greater weight gain and obesity risk [6,\u00a017-19]. Stressful experiences may increase demand for energy and promote gluconeogenesis and energy intake, that may also increase risk of higher food craving and intake [20]. Previous experimental studies assessing acute stress exposure effects on food intake have reported variable results [21-25]. While some research shows stress exposure increases high calorie food intake [17,\u00a024,\u00a026], others have shown reduced food intake with acute stress exposure in people with obesity [23,\u00a027]. However, this research varies by a number of experimental factors, including type of acute stressor utilized in the experiment, weight status of the participants, and type of food presented for intake and exposure time for food intake. More importantly, they have largely not addressed motivational status of the individual, i.e., food cravings, and whether stress increases food craving to promote HP food intake.\nBuilding on the previous literature from addiction models, where stress and drug cues each promote drug craving and facilitate risk of increased drug use [18], we conducted a preliminary experimental study to assess whether exposure to acute stress and HP food cues each increase food craving and intake in healthy lean and overweight individuals. We utilized a previously well-validated and extensively utilized individualized guided imagery method [28-35] for inducing stress, food cues and control neutral relaxing state in the laboratory. This was followed by assessment of HP food craving and intake in a food snack test (FST) after each exposure. Furthermore, as both cortisol and ghrelin have been associated with stress and with HP food intake [36,\u00a037], and are also altered by high BMI status [38], these hormones were repeatedly assessed throughout the study. We hypothesized that food cue and stress will each increase HP food cravings relative to the neutral control condition and that such increases in HP food craving will predict subsequent HP food intake. Furthermore, we hypothesized that significant changes in cortisol and ghrelin during food cue and with stress exposure, will be associated with HP food craving and intake.\nGo to:\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nScreening and Intake Procedures\nHealthy, non-smoking, non-substance using volunteers (12 men; 8 women; aged 18-45) were recruited from a community cohort of volunteers recruited from the greater New Haven area via flyers, radio, and social media advertisements. All volunteers completed medical, demographic, health assessments, including the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV-TR [39], Participants were excluded if they were cigarette smokers, had BMI above 38 due to risk of morbid obesity-related adverse health conditions, reported current dieting, met current DSM-IV-TR\u00a0dependence\u00a0criteria for any substance use disorders, or current other psychiatric disorders, including current eating disorders, had any current medical conditions and illnesses or if they were taking any medications. From 54 volunteers screened for this study, 16 were ineligible pertaining to these exclusions, while the others declined participation due to time constraints and changing their mind. Participants underwent breath alcohol testing, carbon monoxide testing, and urine toxicology screens to confirm being drug-free at each study appointment. Women who were pregnant, lactating or were on oral contraceptives as well as those who were peri or post-menopausal were also excluded. Participants received a physical examination by the admitting physician (JBG) to ensure all participants were in good health. Participants provided written informed consent and the study was approved by the Human Investigation Committee of the Yale University School of Medicine.\nScript Development and Imagery Training\nPrior to participation in the experimental procedures, all subjects participated in a structured interview session for imagery script development for the provocation of stress, food cue and control neutral relaxing contexts for the later laboratory experiment, as per our previously validated methods and structured manualized procedures [30,\u00a032,\u00a033,\u00a035,\u00a040]. Briefly, the stress imagery script was based on participants\u0092 descriptions of a recent personally stressful event which made them \u0093sad, mad, or upset, and with little control over the situation in the moment,\u0094 and that was experienced as \u0093most stressful.\u0094 \u0093Most stressful\u0094 was determined by assessing perceived stress on a 10-point Likert scale where 1 = not at all stressful and 10 = the most stress they felt in the past year. Individual calibration of stressful situations was conducted by only accepting situations rated as 8 or above as appropriate for script development. Stressful situations involving food intake or eating contexts were not allowed. The food cue scripts were developed by participants identifying a recent situation that included their favorite HP food-related stimuli and subsequent intake of those HP foods. Favorite food intake situations that were associated with negative affect or psychological distress were not allowed. A neutral-relaxing, non-physiologically arousing, and non-food related script was developed from the participants\u0092 description of a personally relaxing situation to serve as a control condition (See\u00a0Appendix A\u00a0for sample imagery scripts).\nImagery Training and Habituation Session:\u00a0\nParticipants were also provided with training in progressive relaxation and mental imagery in a 40 minute session prior to experimental sessions on Day 1 of admission as described below. During this session, an Intravenous (IV) heparin-treated catheter was inserted by the research nurse in the antecubital region of the participant\u0092s non-preferred arm for the participant to habituate to any potential stress of the IV insertion. No blood was drawn during this training session. The procedures for the training are outlined in the imagery training manual [40] and in previous work [30]. Briefly the progressive muscle relaxation procedure involved learning to monitor the tension in specific muscle groups by first tensing each muscle group, then releasing the tension, while directing attention towards the differences felt during tension and relaxation.\nExperimental Procedures:\nParticipants were admitted for a three-day, 2-night stay at the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation-Hospital Research Unit (HRU) located at the Yale New Haven Hospital, to ensure a controlled environment during the 3-day experiment. Upon admission on day 1, subjects were trained in progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery and habituated to the IV insertion, as per our previous work and as outlined in the personalized imagery procedures training manual [40]. On each experimental day, participants were brought into the testing room at 2:00PM, after eating a standard healthy lunch at noon. A heparin-treated catheter was inserted by the research nurse in the antecubital region of the participant\u0092s non-preferred arm. A 45-minute adaptation period followed, after which baseline plasma samples were drawn and subjective anxiety and food craving assessments were conducted before and after a 20 minute progressive relaxation procedure. Next, participants were provided with headphones and exposed to an audio recording of the 5-minute personalized guided imagery script of either their stress, food cue, or neutral-relaxing scenarios, only one condition per day in a randomized and counterbalanced order of presentation across subjects. We instructed participants to:\u00a0\u0093Close your eyes and imagine the situation being described, \u0091as if\u0092 it were happening right now. Let your body and mind get completely involved in the situation, doing what you would do in the real situation.\u0094\u00a0Immediately following imagery exposure on each day, and after blood draws and assessments, participants were presented with the food snack test (FST) which comprised 4 bowls of HP snacks of one each of chocolate pudding, potato chips, popcorn and mini chocolate chip cookies, and two bowls of healthy snacks of baby carrots and grapes, each portioned to ~500 calories (3000 calories per lab session). The presentation of the FST with HP foods serves as discrete HP food cues presented after imagery to assess effects on food motivation prior to food intake. Participants were then provided with the following instructions:\u00a0\u0093There are 6 bowls of different snacks on the tray. We will leave these here for the next hour and you can eat as much or as little as you like during the next hour\u0094.\u00a0All subjects were also videotaped for observed eating behavior coding. During this period, participants were not allowed to watch movies or do other activities but did have access to their phones. At the end of the hour, the tray was removed and the total calories consumed from each bowl of HP and healthy snacks was measured after each session as a measure of behavioral HP food motivation and intake. Food craving, anxiety, bloods draws for cortisol and ghrelin assessments were made at repeated timepoints throughout the session (Figure 1). All research staff were blind to the condition on each day as audiotapes were only marked by day and not by condition, which allowed for all assessments being conducted in a blinded manner.\nDependent Measures\nHP Food Craving\u00a0\nA brief 6-item food craving scale (FCS) was derived from the well-validated\u00a0Food Craving Inventory\u00a0(FCI, [41]), and included highly rated select high sugar, carbohydrate and fat items, for repeated assessment of food craving in an experimental setting. The specific FCI items rated included in the laboratory FCS were pizza, brownie, chocolate, cookies, ice cream and steak (on a 7 point scale). A total HP food craving score (sum of ratings) was computed at each timepoint of assessment as shown in\u00a0Figure 1.\nSubjective Anxiety Ratings\u00a0\nSubjective anxiety was rated on a 11-point scale anchored at 0 for \u0093not at all\u0094 and 10 for \u0093extremely anxious\u0094 measured at each assessment timepoint per session as shown in\u00a0Figure 1.\nMeasurement of Cortisol and Ghrelin\u00a0\nPlasma samples (8 mL) were collected at the same 8 consecutive time-points as food craving on each day (Figure 1). All plasma samples were collected in heparinized tubes that were immediately placed on ice after drawing. Within 30 minutes of collection, the blood was centrifuged at 4\u00b0C and the plasma was pooled and aliquoted for cortisol and for total ghrelin assays. All tubes were stored at ?70\u00b0C and analyzed using standard radioimmunoassay procedures as reported previously [19,\u00a031].\nFood Snack Test (FST) Calories Consumed:\u00a0\nAll snacks were carefully weighed and 500 calories of the snack foods of chocolate pudding, potato chips, popcorn, mini chocolate chip cookies, baby carrots and grapes were portioned into their respective bowls prior to each session as shown in\u00a0Figure 1. After the one-hour snacking period in each session, the amount of food snack consumed from each bowl was computed and the calories for each food was recorded, with a maximum of 500 calories per bowl for a total of 3000 calories for each laboratory session per day. HP food calories was a sum of the chocolate chip cookies, chocolate pudding, popcorn and potato chips, while the healthy food calories comprised the sum of calories of baby carrots and grapes consumed on each day.\nData Analytic Plan\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (SAS, Version 9.3) and all figures were created with GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).\nWe used Linear mixed effect (LME) models with a compound symmetry matrix structure for all analyses. The study design included the Between-Subjects factor of BMI [Lean(LN): below 25; Overweight/Obese(OW): 25-28] and Within-Subjects repeated factors, of Condition (Food cue, stress, neutral-relaxing) and Timepoint (baseline before imagery(?5), immediately following imagery(0), pre-snack timepoint prior to FST(+15), and 4 additional timepoints during ((+30, +45, +60) and post (+75) FST). Using these models, we tested the effects of BMI and Condition (food cue, stress relative to neutral cues) on food craving, cortisol, ghrelin and FST intake across time points. LME models in SAS also provide simple effects estimates with corresponding t-tests to deconstruct significant main effects and interactions. The specific contrasts were Stress (S) relative to neutral (N), Food Cue (FC) relative to N, and FC relative to N to deconstruct Condition main effects. In addition, BMI X Condition interaction effects were deconstructed with Condition effects as outlined above for each BMI group, and also for each Condition contrasting BMI groups, i.e., LN: S-N, FC-N, FC-S; OW: S-N, FC-N, FC-S; and LN vs. OW for S, FC and N conditions. In addition, Pearson product-moment correlation analyses were conducted to assess the relationship of pre-snacking food craving, cortisol and ghrelin and amount of HP food consumed during the FST.\nGo to:\nRESULTS\nThe subject sample comprised 12 men and 8 women, with 8 individuals with BMI\u0092s in the lean (LN; 38% women) and 12 in the overweight/obese (OWOB - BMI: 25-38; 42% women) range, with a mean age of 31.35 (SD: 7.39), mean education level of 15.2 years (SD: 2.07), mean IQ of 111.4 (SD:7.9), who were 35% Caucasian, 35% African American, 20% Hispanic and 10% Other. There were no differences between BMI groups on any of these demographic characteristics.\nPre-Snack HP Food Craving (FCS) and Subjective Anxiety Ratings:\nFor\u00a0subjective HP food craving, a significant effect of Condition (F(2,36)=12.74, p<.0001) and BMI Group X Condition (F(2,36)=4.93, p<.02) was observed. Simple effects t-test analyses indicated significantly higher food craving in the food cue relative to neutral (FC > N: t=4.92, p<.0001) and relative to stress(FC>S: t=3.45, p<.001). Simple effects for the BMI X Condition effect revealed the lean (LN) group showing greater craving only in the food cue relative to neutral condition (t=4.66, p<.0001), but the OW group showing food craving increases in both the food cue (t=2.27, p<.04) and in the stress (t=2.01, p<.05) relative to neutral conditions (see\u00a0Figure 2a).\nFor\u00a0HP FST intake, a main effect of Condition (F(2,36)=3.86, p<.03) was observed, indicating significantly higher levels of HP food calories consumed in the food cue (t=2.99, p<.01) relative to the neutral condition (Figure 2b). A trend level interaction of BMI Group X Condition (F(2,36)=3.31, p<.08) was also observed, resulting from greater HP food calories (HP FCAL) consumed in the food cue relative to neutral condition for the Lean (t=2.14, p<.04) only, but higher HPF CAL consumed in the stress condition for the OW relative to the LN group (t= 1.91, p<.05) (see\u00a0Figure 2b).\nFor\u00a0subjective anxiety, a significant effect of Condition (F(2,36)=8.7, p<.0008) and BMI Group X Condition (F(2,36)=3.71, p<.03) was observed. Simple effect contrasts revealed overall significantly higher anxiety in the food cue (t=2.02, p<.05) and in stress (t=2.11, p<.04) relative to the neutral condition, but this arose from the people with Lean BMIs showing no significant increases in anxiety across any condition, but the people with OW/OB BMIs showing increased anxiety in the food cue (t=2.10, p<.03) and in the stress (t=4.35, p<.001) relative to the neutral condition (see\u00a0Figure 2c).\nRelationship between Pre-Snack HP Food Craving and HP FST Calorie Consumed:\nPre-FST food craving scores (FCS_PreSnack) were found to be highly correlated with subsequent HP food calories (HPF_CAL) consumed in the food cue (r=.82, p<.0001) condition across groups but not in the neutral condition (r=.31, p<.18). On the other hand, stress-induced food craving predicted HP FST intake only in the OW group but not in the Lean group (OW: r=.68, p<.02; LN: r=.55, p<.12) (see\u00a0Figure 3a\u00a0-\u00a0?-3c3c).\nTotal Ghrelin Response and Relationship to HP Food Craving and Intake\nOverall LME analyses revealed a Condition main effect (F(2,35)=5.61, p<.008), but no significant BMI Group X Condition interaction (F(2,35)=0.75, p<.48). The Condition main effect resulted from stress (t=2.88, p<.007) and food cue (t=2.97, p<.005) exposure each increasing ghrelin relative to the neutral condition (see\u00a0Figure 4a). Secondary exploratory effect of group differences showed that ghrelin increases during both stress and in food cue relative to neutral conditions was due to increases in those in the OW/OB BMI group (FC vs N: t=2.54, p<.02 S vs N: t=3.25, p<.003) and not the lean group (FC vs N: t= 1.78, p<.08; S vs N: t=1.12, p<.27) (see\u00a0Fig 4a). Association between total ghrelin increases in each condition and food craving and intake were also conducted and revealed that stress-induced, but not food cue-induced increases in ghrelin were significantly associated with HP food craving and intake, and only in the OW group (see\u00a0Figure 4b\u00a0-\u00a0?-4c4c).\nDISCUSSION\nThis preliminary study is the first to directly compare the effects of both food cue and stress exposure on HP food craving and HP food intake in a 3-day human laboratory experiment conducted within a controlled hospital-based setting with healthy community adults. As both the ubiquitous HP food environment and stressors are known to increase HP food intake and obesity risk, a direct comparison of these contexts could identify similar and differential processes that may underlie food motivation and intake. As hypothesized, and similar to our previous work in addiction [18], we found that exposure to both personal food cues and to personal stressors relative to a neutral relaxing control cue resulted in increases in HP food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods in a standardized Food Snack Test (FST), but with differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups. Furthermore, we found that increased food craving in these contexts was highly associated with subsequent amounts of HP food snack intake. Finally, both ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. Together, these results support the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.\nExposure to food cue imagery led to significant increases in HP food craving prior to the presentation of the FST at the pre-snack timepoint in both lean and OW individuals. Moreover, food cue-related increases in food craving predicted significant increases in HP snack intake across both lean and OW individuals. These data are consistent with a significant literature indicating that rewarding stimuli and their related contexts increase motivation and wanting of rewarding stimuli via conditioning and/or incentive salience mechanisms [4,\u00a020,\u00a042]. Also, a number of basic science and human neuroimaging studies have shown that food cue stimulus exposure increases food craving and activate brain reward and motivation regions [4,\u00a07-11,\u00a018,\u00a043,\u00a044]. Current findings further indicate that such food cue-related increases in HP food craving promote HP snack intake with greater intake of HP foods in the food cue context relative to the neutral relaxing contexts across individuals. These data validate the real-world contexts of advertising of HP foods to promote greater sales and intake of HP foods.\nIn contrast, we found a differential impact of stress on HP food craving and intake by BMI group where stress significantly increased food craving relative to the neutral condition, but only in the overweight and not the lean group. Furthermore, stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group, suggesting that food motivational processes may be relevant in identifying those who are vulnerable to stress-induced eating. Previous laboratory studies have shown mixed results with some showing stress increasing food intake [17,\u00a024], but others reporting no consistent increases in intake [23,\u00a045]. While the methodology has varied across these studies, current findings suggest the need for direct comparison of BMI groups and consideration of weight-related adaptations in assessing stress effects on HP food motivation and intake. Current findings are also supported by a growing literature suggesting that BMI-related alterations impact not only metabolic hormones but also stress and reward processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake [18,\u00a020,\u00a044]. Together our findings on food cue- and stress- related effects on HP food motivation and intake suggests differential effects by BMI, that may in turn, point to different mechanisms that may drive weight gain and obesity risk in individuals who are lean versus those who are overweight.\nOur findings also show differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin responses and their contribution to HP food motivation and intake. Stress and food cue exposure increased ghrelin responses, but significantly for the OW and not the LN group. Furthermore, only in the OW group was stress-induced ghrelin increases significantly associated with both HP food craving and subsequent HP food intake. While ghrelin has well known homeostatic effects on feeding function [46,\u00a047], recent focus has been on its role in both stress and mood regulation as well as in hedonically motivated feeding behavior, partially via its effects on mesolimbic reward circuits [37,\u00a048]. Findings indicate that ghrelin can shift preferences to high palatable foods and increase the motivational aspects of food reward [48]. Ghrelin is also known to increase with stress and is involved in regulating anxiety and mood (36,\u00a049-51). Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that ghrelin administration increases the neural response to food pictures in areas associated with hedonic eating (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and ventral tegmental area) [52]. Additionally, there is growing evidence that feed-forward circuitry between stress and food reward maybe partly mediated by ghrelin [52,\u00a053]. In the current study, as the effects were specific to the OW group, they suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions.\nFinally, our findings also showed differential effects of cortisol responses to stress and food cue exposure. Notably, there was a significant increase in cortisol in the food cue relative to the neutral condition that was due to significant increases in cortisol in the lean group and not so in the OW group. Furthermore, food cue-related increases in cortisol was associated with greater food cue-related HP craving, suggesting a role for cortisol in food motivation. While glucocorticoids are often associated with the stress response, they are also known to play an important role in energy intake and regulation. Cortisol increases have been noted with intake of specific macronutrients, including carbohydrates, fats and proteins in animals and humans [6,\u00a054], with the source of cortisol increases to be via both adrenal and extra-adrenal production [54]. Furthermore, in our previous neuroimaging study, increases in cortisol during a mild hypoglycemic state was associated with greater activation of brain reward regions that promoted greater food craving [44]. Together, this previous research supports current findings of the association between greater cortisol responses to food cue exposure with food cue-induced HP food craving.\nWe did not see an overall significant increase in cortisol during stress exposure, but this was largely due to a lack of response in the OW group. Remarkably, the OW group showed blunted cortisol responses during stress and food cue relative to neutral conditions. This finding is consistent with growing evidence of blunted cortisol and autonomic responses to stress challenge in people who are OW or obese, along with altered autonomic and peripheral catecholamine responses to stress challenge in those weight groups [18,\u00a021-25,\u00a055]. HPA axis adaptations with low cortisol awakening responses have been reported in higher BMI groups, along with blunted responses to stress and reduced dopamine activity [20,\u00a056]. Thus, the current findings of lack of cortisol increases in the OW group leads one to speculate that such HPA axis adaptations may contribute to higher HP food craving and intake in food cue and in stress contexts. However, this is speculation and would need further testing in future studies.\nSeveral limitations of the current study need to be considered. First, the sample size was small and thus the findings are preliminary and need further validation. Also, due to the small sample size, sex differences and differential responses within the overweight groups were not assessed. It is possible that men and women differ in their food motivation and intake responses in food cue and stress contexts as shown in previous work [26,27]. Also, continuous assessment of BMI rather than arbitrary cutoffs for individuals in the lean, overweight and obese BMI range may provide greater sensitivity in assessing weight related adaptations. Thus, research with larger samples is required to replicate current findings and address these issues. Finally, as this study was conducted while participants were in a hospital, it is not clear whether the findings are generalizable to an outpatient experimental context or to real world food motivation and intake settings. On the other hand, as food cues and stress are among the most common contexts in which overeating of HP foods occur in the real world, the current study presents a well-controlled experimental model to study the biobehavioral processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake of highly palatable foods. Evidence of HP food motivation and increased snacking in these contexts is consistent with reports of obesogenic environments promoting increased HP food intake and weight gain in the real world. Furthermore, positive associations of HP food craving and intake by total ghrelin and cortisol responses suggests a role for metabolic and neuroendocrine adaptations in increased HP food motivation and intake.\n?\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n* This paper directly compares the effects of both food cue and stress exposure on highly palatable food craving and intake in a 3-day human laboratory experiment conducted within a controlled hospital-based setting with healthy community adults.\n* Results show that food cues and stress exposure increases food craving and subsequent snacking of highly palatable foods, and food cravings predict subsequent highly palatable food intake.\n* Ghrelin and cortisol hormones appear to play a role in food cue and stress related food motivation and intake.\n* These findings suggest the need for further carefully controlled studies to understand the biobehavioral processes that drive overeating and weight gain.\n\n", "prep step": "Think about why this might be relevant for the audience in the grand scheme of things.    \nIdentify 1 or 2 key concepts from this article that would make interesting or helpful health content.

Accordingly, in the current study, healthy young men and women performed 8 weeks of supervised resistance training with concomitant high- or low-dose NSAID treatment. The major and novel findings were that 1) maximal overthe-counter doses of ibuprofen compromised resistance exercise-induced muscle hypertropy\nindependent of training mode; 2) increases in muscle strength were attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions; 3) while the resistance-training intervention resulted in several muscle molecular adaptations, the only marked difference across medical treatment was a significant ibuprofen-induced downregulation of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 mRNA, compared with an upregulation in the ASA group. This is the first study showing that daily consumption of high doses of NSAIDs attenuates strength and muscle hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young healthy individuals. We acknowledge that a limitation of the current study was that we did not include a non-treated control group. However, the increase in muscle volume (7.5%) in the ASA group was of a similar, and expected, magnitude to that previously reported by our group20 and others.21,22 In the light of this, the magnitude of the reduction in muscle hypertrophy in response to the ibuprofen treatment was quite remarkable and, if anything, should the ASA treatment have had a small effect on the adaptive response, it would only have masked an even greater difference across groups than what is reported herein. Nonetheless, given the marked effect of ibuprofen and the fact that the increase in muscle size in the control group (0.14% per day) was of similar magnitude as the average rate of hypertrophy reported in past studies employing knee-extensor resistance training,23 we are confident that our data provide strong proof-of-principle evidence that the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent of the dose of intake. The rationale for using acetylsalicylic acid instead of ibuprofen as a low-dose comparator in the current study was based on the fact that when the drug is consumed orally, it undergoes substantial presystemic hydrolysis in the gut and liver before it enters the systemic bloodstream. As the drug will, however, encounter blood in the portal circulation, low doses of acetylsalicylic acid will exert its antiplatelet effect with no or limited effect on systemic targets such as peripheral tissue.16\u009618 Consequently, the potential circulatory effects are factored out and we hypothesize that the negative effect of ibuprofen was due to muscle-specific COX inhibition rather than the antiplatelet effect achieved by both ibuprofen and low doses of acetylsalicylic acid.18,24 The results of the present study are in agreement with animal studies showing an inhibitory effect of COX inhibitors on muscle hypertrophy.8,9,25 They also agree with acute human data reporting attenuated protein synthesis,5 translational signalling13 and satellite cell activity11,12 in response to resistance training with concomitant high-dose NSAID administration. Our hypothesis of a dose-dependent effect is also supported by the only comparable training study in young healthy subjects.14 That particular study reported no effect of ibuprofen on muscle hypertrophy or strength gains after 6 weeks of training consisting of six sets of biceps curls 2\u00963 days week---------------1 . The drug dose was consumed on training days only, resulting in a total intake of 800\u00961200 mg week---------------1 , 14 compared with 1200 mg per day in the current study. This indeed highlights the potential importance of drug dosage where, evidently, intake of maximal over-the-counter doses is potent enough to interfere with the normal hypertrophic development of 0.1\u00960.2% per day seen in the ASA group as well as in other studies employing conventional resistance-training programmes for the knee extensors.23 It is generally agreed that repeated increases in muscle protein synthesis following each exercise bout is the most important mechanism underlying training-induced muscle hypertrophy.26,27 Thus, it seems plausible to suggest that the main explanation for the clear attenuation of hypertrophy, which was evident in both training modes (FW and WS), was diminished prostaglandin production and hence decreased muscle protein synthetic response after each training session in the IBU group. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that COX and prostaglandins play an important role in regulating the molecular events controlling muscle hypertrophy. For example, C2C12 myotube diameter was shown to be regulated by PGF2a in an mTORdependent manner7 , and exercise-induced increases in p70S6K (downstream of mTOR) was blunted by ibuprofen treatment in the early hours following acute resistance exercise.13 In the current study, however, there were no group interactions for any of the target proteins examined, suggesting that the ibuprofenmodulating effect on muscle adaptations is not associated with differential expression of steady-state proteins in response to chronic training. Perhaps assessing satellite cell content,11 or the phosphorylation levels of translational signalling proteins in response to acute exercise,13 would have provided more mechanistic insights. We measured several key molecular markers for COX and prostaglandin-mediated metabolism, regulators of muscle growth and atrophy, and several cytokines and myokines that have been shown to regulate skeletal muscle protein metabolism and exercise adaptations.4 The most clear-cut molecular evidence for an effect of ibuprofen on peripheral muscle tissue was the marked drug effect on IL-6 mRNA, where levels in the ibuprofen group were downregulated despite a significant upregulation in the control group. The reduction of IL-6 in the ibuprofen group is coherent with previous studies suggesting PGE2 as a stimulator of IL-6 transcription in both human muscle28 and other cell types.29 It has previously been reported that the NSAID-modulating effects on muscle hypertrophy in older subjects were associated with lowered expression of IL-6 and subsequently MuRF-1, resulting in a more beneficial cellular environment for muscle growth.30 While our data are coherent with that of Trappe and colleagues regarding the expression of IL-6 in the ibuprofen-treated group (downregulated) compared to the control group (upregulated), the muscle hypertrophy data certainly contradict these findings. In that study, elderly subjects (60\u009678 years) performed 12 weeks of resistance training with simultaneous daily ibuprofen treatment of 1200 mg. The increase in muscle size was substantially greater with ibuprofen compared with placebo,15 and this was supported by acute data showing no interference of ibuprofen on muscle protein synthesis in the same age group.31 Thus, interestingly, there may be distinct differences in the response to resistance training and NSAID consumption in the young vs. the elderly, and probably also in the mechanistic underpinnings of exercise-induced tissue remodelling in these age groups. Specifically, in the present cohort of young subjects, it is possible that blunting of important inflammatory processes, as reflected by the downregulated IL-6 gene expression, contributed to the attenuated hypertrophic response because previous studies have shown that induction of IL-6, and also other inflammatory and proteolytic factors, has an important role in muscle regenerative processes during hypertrophic conditions.32,33 In contrast, the role of inflammatory processes may be different in the elderly where an ibuprofen-induced downregulation of IL-6 could reduce chronic low-grade inflammation and thereby restore the blunted anabolic response to resistance exercise typically seen in aged populations.34 Thus, based on the current data and given the complex regulation of mRNA and protein levels,35,36 future studies should directly compare the response to resistance exercise and NSAID treatment in young vs. old populations as well as incorporate better time resolution, including both acute and chronic biopsy time points and perhaps also higher-throughput techniques, to provide more conclusive evidence of the critical mechanisms regulating the interactive effects of NSAIDs and resistance exercise on muscle adaptations. The functional data showed that increases in muscle strength were attenuated in IBU compared with ASA, but only in the FW leg. In our mind, this leads to two questions: first, if this strength difference was explained by the larger increase in muscle size in the control group, why was strength not reduced in the WS leg? Second, if not muscle size, what other mechanisms could explain the fact that strength was negatively affected by ibuprofen only in the FW leg? Regarding the first question, although muscle mass and strength are generally highly correlated at baseline in pre-training situations,37,38 the same does not necessarily apply when it comes to increases in strength and muscle size following short-term resistance training.39,40 This was also the case in the current study, where in fact the correlation between changes in muscle size and strength was very weak (R2 ~0.05; data not shown). Thus, it appears that strength gains can occur irrespective of the magnitude of increase in muscle volume and hence, this could explain why, in the WS leg, the larger increase in muscle volume for the ASA group did not result in a larger increase in strength compared with IBU. It is plausible that with longer-term training, once neural adaptations have plateaued,41 the relationship between muscle size and strength would be restored and hence the negative effect of ibuprofen on strength would be even more evident. As to the second question raised above, we did speculate beforehand that perhaps NSAID consumption could affect acute training performance and thereby the capacity to perform high-intensity repetitive work bouts. It appeared at first that the strength reduction in the FW leg was not related to a reduction in day-to-day training performance, as both groups performed an equal amount of work throughout the 8-week training programme. Interestingly, however, a closer look at the data in Figure 1 reveals that the ibuprofen group certainly showed a levelling-off effect during the last week of flywheel training, which likely explains the lower strength gains noted. Regarding the logical follow-up question of why training performance in the FW leg was negatively affected by ibuprofen only at the end of the training period, we are unable to provide a definite answer. However, given that the main differences between the two training modes is the eccentric overload, provoking greater inflammatory stimulus, and the maximal unlimited resistance provided by the flywheel device,21,42 it is tempting to speculate that one (or both) of these two features are particularly prone to ibuprofen treatment, at least after a few weeks of accumulated training. It should also be noted that day-to-day performance levels varied much more in the FW leg, indicating that this training regime was more stressful for the subjects. Alternatively, as indicated earlier, the relationship between muscle mass and strength became more important at the end of the training period, and hence, the levelling-off phenomenon in the IBU group was due to the compromised hypertrophic development. Altogether, based on the current data and given the knowledge of different time resolutions for the underlying mechanisms of muscle strength, longer training studies could clarify whether interference in muscle growth will be associated with reduced muscle strength, and whether different training modes, such as eccentric overload, are even more sensitive to concomitant NSAID treatment. Notwithstanding, our findings raise the concern that resistance-training studies employing strict work-matched increases across groups might overlook important effects of various factors such as medical treatments or supplements that would have become evident if maximal efforts had been allowed throughout each set and training session. In summary, we show for the first time that maximal over-the-counter doses of NSAIDs compromise resistance exercise-induced increases in muscle size and strength in young adults. The gains in muscle size were attenuated by ibuprofen independent of the type of training performed, whereas muscle strength was attenuated only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. Furthermore, while the resistance-training intervention resulted in several muscle molecular adaptations, the only marked difference across medical treatment was a significant ibuprofen-induced reduction in IL-6 gene expression, which in our mind reflected a changed inflammatory environment that, speculatively, contributed to the attenuated hypertrophic development in the ibuprofen group. This study improves our understanding of how NSAIDs work and interacts with chronic exercise responses, and considering the potency of the drug to modify muscle mass and function, the mechanistic findings should contribute to a better understanding of regulation of muscle growth in general. More importantly, however, the results have implications for the millions of individuals worldwide who consume NSAIDs on a regular basis while trying to obtain the best possible benefits of resistance training. \nMethods \nEthical approval All subjects were given oral and written information about the study before giving written informed consent to participate. The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm and conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki. In agreement with EU legislation, the study was sanctioned by the Swedish Medical Products Agency (EudraCT-number: 2014-004872-47). The trial was registered as a clinical trial on ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier NCT02531451. Subjects All subjects (recreationally active men and women aged 18\u009635 years, Table 2) were recruited from the Stockholm region. Prior to inclusion, subjects completed a full medical screening including health and exercise history anamnesis and analysis of blood biochemistry. Exclusion criteria were current or previous cardiovascular disease, impaired kidney or liver function, auto-immune disease, lower limb or knee injury, pregnancy, history of ulcers or gastrointestinal upsets, or previous negative reactions to the use of NSAIDs. Subjects who had performed structured resistance training (more than once per week) for the past 6 months were also excluded. From the 48 individuals who were assessed for eligibility, 31 were included in the final data analysis (Fig. 7). Drug administration and accountability Each subject was given the whole batch of pills together with a medical diary on the first day of consumption (i.e. day 1 of the first training week). The ibuprofen group was instructed, orally and in writing, to take three doses/day (~08:00, ~14:00 and ~20:00 h.) corresponding to the maximal over-thecounter daily dose of 1200 mg (400 mg dose---------------1 ). The control group receiving acetylsalicylic acid was instructed to take one dose per day (75 mg) in conjunction with their morning meal. All subjects documented the time and date for each dose in the provided diary and were reminded about the importance of correct drug consumption on every visit to the exercise laboratory, and through text messages several times per week. The last day of medication was day 7 of the final (i.e. eighth) training week. After the 8-week training intervention, all subjects returned the medical diary and leftover medicines. All remaining pills were subsequently counted and compared with the written logs in the diary to control for drug compliance. Despite all these efforts, as no direct evidence of drug consumption was obtained, it remains possible that the subjects did not fully comply with these requirements. Nonetheless, all medicine administration and accountability were performed in agreement with the code of Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) by a certified external partner, the Clinical Pharmacology Trial Unit, at the Karolinska University Hospital in Huddinge, Stockholm. Thus, although the subjects were not blinded to their treatment, the research personnel responsible for monitoring training sessions stayed blind for the drug assignment during the whole intervention. The study hypothesis was never presented to the subjects.\n\nSafety procedures and adverse event reporting At every occasion where research staff met with the subjects (i.e. 2\u00963 times week---------------1 ), they were asked about any health complaints or suspected adverse reactions. Any adverse event was reported by study personnel to the principal investigator. If events occurred in the home or elsewhere during the study period, subjects were instructed to promptly report the incident to study staff who in turn would contact the principal investigator. All adverse events, or suspicion of such, were recorded in case report forms with symptoms, severity, date, time and assessment of potential relation to the study drugs. The medically responsible physician decided whether any further action (i.e. treatment or medication) was required. Exercise equipment and familiarization To elucidate whether ibuprofen affected day-to-day training performance, one leg was assigned to perform training with maximal volitional work allowed in each repetition using a flywheel ergometer, while on the other leg the training volume was matched between groups using regular weight-stack training. Thus, each of the subject\u0092s legs was randomized either to a non-gravity-dependent training device (YoYo Technology, Stockholm, Sweden) or a traditional weight-stack device (World Class, Stockholm, Sweden). The non-gravity-dependent device, hereafter flywheel or FW, was equipped with a 5-kg (men, inertia 0.075 kg m---------------2 or) or 3.5-kg (women, inertia 0.05 kg m---------------2 ) flywheel to provide inertial resistance during coupled concentric and eccentric actions. Peak concentric and eccentric power for each repetition was calculated from measures of rotational velocity (SmartCoach, Stockholm, Sweden). The weight-stack device (WS) employed constant external loading, that is isotonic loading. Weight plates of 5, 2 and 1 kg were used to set and adjust the load. The main difference between the two devices is that FW allows for maximal voluntary force to be produced from the very first repetition, whereas WS is dependent on the increasing exertion throughout each set, and maximal voluntary force is hence only offered in the last repetitions (i.e. close to failure). In addition, the FW offers brief episodes of eccentric overload.21 In both training devices, the subjects were seated (90\u00b0 hip angle, 80\u00b0 knee angle) and performed the concentric phase of the lift to ~175\u00b0 knee joint angle before entering the eccentric phase to ~80\u00b0 knee joint angle. Maximal isometric and isokinetic strength for the knee extensors were assessed using isokinetic dynamometry with a sampling frequency of 2000 Hz (Biodex System 4 Pro, Biodex Medical Systems, NY). The chest, hip and thigh were stabilized to the dynamometer using straps, and the ankle was strapped to the lever arm, which was aligned with the axis of rotation of the knee joint. To customize machine settings and familiarize subjects with the exercise procedures used during training and testing, all subjects reported to the laboratory for familiarization three times within 2 weeks prior to the start of the study. Pre- and post-testing All tests were performed using identical protocols both before (PRE) and after (POST) the 8-week training intervention. The tests were scheduled on three different days. First, baseline muscle strength assessments were performed. Maximal isometric strength (0\u00b0/s) and isokinetic strength (30\u00b0/s, 60\u00b0/s, 180\u00b0/s and 270\u00b0/s) were measured. The subjects were allowed two attempts on each velocity (30 s rest), and the best result was accepted as peak torque. Maximal isometric torque was measured at knee angle 120\u00b0. Subjects were instructed to push and hold the pressure against the lever for 5 s. The best attempt defined peak isometric torque. After a five-min rest period, trainingspecific strength was assessed. Thus, for the FW leg, peak power (averaged across sets and repetitions) was assessed for the flywheel device. The subjects performed 2 9 7 repetitions with two-min rests between sets. After another rest period of 5 min, one-repetition maximum (1-RM) strength was assessed in the WS leg. The goal was to reach 1-RM within five attempts. Subjects were instructed to raise the lever arm to ~175\u00b0 knee joint angle in order for the repetition to be accepted as 1-RM. Each attempt was separated by two-min rest. In all of the strength tests, strong verbal encouragement was given by the research staff to call for maximal effort. After 2 or 3 rest days, the muscle biopsy procedure was undertaken (see below). Four days after the biopsy procedure, once associated bleeding and swelling had settled, the MRI scan was performed (see below). During post-tests, the order of tests was maintained. However, as we wished to obtain the post-biopsies no more than 48 h after the last training session, the post-assessment of muscle strength was carried out during the final training week (prior to training session no. 18, and preceded by 48\u0096 72 h rest). The post-biopsies were then taken exactly 48 h (2 h) after the last training session, and the post-MRI scan was conducted 4 days later, that is 6 days after the training intervention ended. Magnetic resonance imaging Cross-sectional images were obtained using a 1.5- Tesla Siemens Magnetom Aera unit (Siemens Healthcare, Germany). The settings were as follows: Turbo spin echo, T2 weighted, TE 110 ms, TR 5723 ms, NSA 3, FOV 48.5 cm, scan time 4 min 50 s and voxel size 0.95 9 0.95 9 10 mm. Fifty continuous images with 10-mm slice thickness were obtained for each subject. To minimize the influence of fluid shift on muscle volume, subjects rested in the supine position for 1 h prior to any scan.43 A custom-made footrestrain device ensured a fixed-limb position and that there was no compression of thigh muscles. Preliminary localization (scout) images were obtained to confirm identical positioning across pre- and post-scans. To ensure that the same segment was scanned before and after training, the top of the caput femoris was used as an anatomical landmark when setting the window (field of view) for each scan. Although pre- and post-images were analysed in parallel, the individual who performed the analysis was blind with regard to all interventions. Muscle volume, mean cross-sectional area (CSA) and signal intensity (mean grey value, MGV) of the m. quadriceps femoris were analysed from the first image not displaying m. gluteus maximus and ending with the last image in which m. rectus femoris appeared.44 Within this segment (10\u0096 18 cm of the thigh), every third image was assessed by manual planimetry using imaging software (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The average of two measures showing less than 1% difference between values was multiplied by slice thickness to obtain muscle volume. Signal intensity was determined as a control measure to verify that any increase in muscle size would reflect true muscle hypertrophy rather than exercise-induced fluid infiltration or muscle swelling.20 Furthermore, as an additional control measure, we assessed the CSA of the untrained m. biceps femoris in the mid-thigh region. Training protocols The subjects performed 20 training sessions during the 8-week training intervention. The sessions were scheduled two and three times every other week, starting with two sessions the first week. All training was performed unilaterally. The subjects had their legs randomized in a counterbalanced fashion to FW on one leg and WS on the other, and this allocation was then preserved for the entire intervention. Each training session started with a standardized warm-up. After a two-min rest, the subjects performed 4 9 7 maximal repetitions on the FW device (two-min rest) and 4 9 8\u009612 repetitions to failure on the WS machine. The protocols were selected based on past research studies employing these particular exercise modes.2,20 The starting order of the machines was altered between every training session. In WS, the training load was progressively increased in a work-matched manner across groups. This was possible through the pair-matching procedure, that is, even though being blinded to the group assignment; the research staff ensured that each assigned pair did comparable amounts of total work throughout the study by manipulating the selected weight. Generally, the weight was progressively increased when the subject was able to perform more than 12 repetitions. In the FW, peak power was measured for each repetition and subjects were instructed, and verbally encouraged, to perform each repetition with maximal effort. Consequently, workload was per definition unlimited. Using this unilateral approach, it was possible to examine if ibuprofen had any effects on acute training performance or if any potential drug effects were unrelated to total work performed during training. Muscle biopsies Tissue samples of the vastus lateralis muscle were obtained under local anaesthesia using the percutaneous Bergstrom technique, \u0080 45 after an overnight fast and with no prior exercise during the past 48 h. Samples were taken from the right leg before training (PRE) and from each leg (WS and FW) 48 h (2 h) after the last training session (POST). All muscle samples (~200 mg) were immediately dissected free of any visible fat, excess blood and connective tissue, and then quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at ---------------80\u00b0C until the analyses. RNA isolation, reverse transcription and real-time PCR Wet muscle samples (20 mg) were homogenized using TRIzol (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and total RNA was subsequently extracted. One lg of total RNA from each sample was used for reverse transcription into cDNA for a final volume of 20 lL (High Capacity Reverse Transcription Kit, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Real-time PCR (ABI-PRISMA 7700 Sequence Detector, PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems) procedures were employed to determine mRNA expression. Probes and primers (TaqMan) for atrogin-1 (Hs00369714_m1), cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1; Hs00377726_m1), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2; Hs00153133_m1), interleukin 6 (IL-6; Hs00985639_m1), mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR; Hs00234522_m1), muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF-1; Hs00822397_m1), MyoD (Hs02330075_g1), myostatin (Hs00193363_m1), p70S6 kinase (p70S6K; Hs00177357_m1), prostaglandin E2 receptor 2 (PGE2 receptor; Hs00168754_m1), prostaglandin F receptor (PGF2a receptor; Hs00168763_m1), tumour necrosis factor (TNF-a; Hs01113624_g1), GAPDH (Hs99999905_m1) and RPS18 (Hs01375212_g1) were all purchased from Applied Biosystems. GAPDH and RPS18 were analysed as reference genes. However, final mRNA data were related only to RPS18 because this gene was stable across all time points and groups. Reaction and amplification mixes (10 lL) consisted of the diluted [1 : 5 (COX-2, PGF2a receptor, PGE2 receptor, IL-6, TNF-a)] or [1 : 100 (COX-1, p70S6K; mTOR, MyoD-1, myostatin, atrogin-1, MuRF-1)] cDNA (4.5 lL), TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (5.0 lL) and specific primers (0.5 lL). Subsequent cycling protocols were 2 min at 50\u00b0C and 10 min at 90\u00b0C followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. Target gene expression was reported as a ratio to the reference gene using the 2---------------DCT formula. Protein extraction and immunoblot analysis Muscle samples (~30 mg) cleansed from visible blood, fat and connective tissue were freeze-dried and subsequently homogenized in ice-cold buffer (100 lL mg---------------1 dry wt) consisting of 2 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X 100, 2 mM dithiothreitol and 1.5% (v/v) phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktail (HaltTM, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, MD, USA) using a BulletBlender (NextAdvance, Averill Park, NY, USA) with 0.5 mm ZrO beads. The homogenates obtained were rotated for 60 min at 4\u00b0C and subsequently centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The resulting supernatant was collected and stored at ---------------80\u00b0C. Protein concentrations were determined in aliquots of supernatant diluted 1 : 10 in distilled water using the Pierce 660 nm protein assay (Thermo Scientific). Muscle homogenates were diluted with 49 Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA) and homogenizing buffer to obtain a final protein concentration of 1.4 lg lL---------------1 . Subsequently, all samples were heated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min to denature proteins and then stored at ---------------20\u00b0C until further analysis. As an additional control to confirm a stable muscle contractile fraction from PRE to POST, we assessed estimated muscle water content by relating the dry muscle weight to the wet weight,20 as measured on a precision microbalance at standardized temperature and humidity. The immunoblotting procedures were performed as described by Apro et al.46 with slight modifications for this study. Samples containing total protein of 40 lg were separated by SDS\u0096polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on 18-well Criterion TGX gradient gels (4\u009620% acrylamide; Bio-Rad). Both ASA and IBU samples were loaded on each gel, and each sample from each subject was always loaded onto the same gel, beginning with the PRE sample followed by POST right and POST left leg respectively. The blots were quantified using the Quantity One software from Bio-Rad. To control for appropriate loading and transfer, target proteins were expressed relative to whole-lane analysis of protein content obtained by staining the membranes with MemCode Reversible Protein Stain Kit (Thermo Scientific).47 The monoclonal primary antibodies used for the detection of target total proteins were the following: mTOR (7C10; no. 2983; 1 : 1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA); p70S6K (49D7; no. 2708; 1 : 1000; Cell Signaling Technology); TNF-a (D5G9; no. 6945; 1 : 500; Cell Signaling Technology); MyoD1 (D8G3; XP; no. 13812; 1 : 500; Cell Signaling Technology); and MuRF-1 (C-11; no. sc-398608; 1 : 1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Heidelberg, Germany). The secondary antibodies used were all from Cell Signaling Technology: anti-rabbit (1 : 10 000; mTOR, p70S6k), (1 : 5000; MyoD-1), (1 : 2000; TNF-a) and anti-mouse (1 : 10 000; MuRF-1) IgG antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Statistics Independent t-tests were used to compare descriptive data for the two groups. Data distribution was manually checked on histograms for any marked skewness. Subsequently, two-way ANOVAs with factors group (ASA vs. IBU) and time (PRE vs. POST) were used to compare training-induced changes in all dependent variables across the two groups. The magnitude of the effects of key outcome variables (muscle size and strength) was further assessed using Cohen\u0092s effect size (d) and associated 90% confidence limits to estimate the size and precision of mean group differences (i.e. the difference in change scores from pre to post). Group differences of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 were considered as trivial, small, moderate and large effect sizes respectively.48 The significance level was set to 5% (P < 0.05).

Accordingly, in the current study, healthy young men and women performed 8 weeks of supervised resistance training with concomitant high- or low-dose NSAID treatment. The major and novel findings were that 1) maximal overthe-counter doses of ibuprofen compromised resistance exercise-induced muscle hypertropy\nindependent of training mode; 2) increases in muscle strength were attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions; 3) while the resistance-training intervention resulted in several muscle molecular adaptations, the only marked difference across medical treatment was a significant ibuprofen-induced downregulation of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 mRNA, compared with an upregulation in the ASA group. This is the first study showing that daily consumption of high doses of NSAIDs attenuates strength and muscle hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young healthy individuals. We acknowledge that a limitation of the current study was that we did not include a non-treated control group. However, the increase in muscle volume (7.5%) in the ASA group was of a similar, and expected, magnitude to that previously reported by our group20 and others.21,22 In the light of this, the magnitude of the reduction in muscle hypertrophy in response to the ibuprofen treatment was quite remarkable and, if anything, should the ASA treatment have had a small effect on the adaptive response, it would only have masked an even greater difference across groups than what is reported herein. Nonetheless, given the marked effect of ibuprofen and the fact that the increase in muscle size in the control group (0.14% per day) was of similar magnitude as the average rate of hypertrophy reported in past studies employing knee-extensor resistance training,23 we are confident that our data provide strong proof-of-principle evidence that the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent of the dose of intake. The rationale for using acetylsalicylic acid instead of ibuprofen as a low-dose comparator in the current study was based on the fact that when the drug is consumed orally, it undergoes substantial presystemic hydrolysis in the gut and liver before it enters the systemic bloodstream. As the drug will, however, encounter blood in the portal circulation, low doses of acetylsalicylic acid will exert its antiplatelet effect with no or limited effect on systemic targets such as peripheral tissue.16\u009618 Consequently, the potential circulatory effects are factored out and we hypothesize that the negative effect of ibuprofen was due to muscle-specific COX inhibition rather than the antiplatelet effect achieved by both ibuprofen and low doses of acetylsalicylic acid.18,24 The results of the present study are in agreement with animal studies showing an inhibitory effect of COX inhibitors on muscle hypertrophy.8,9,25 They also agree with acute human data reporting attenuated protein synthesis,5 translational signalling13 and satellite cell activity11,12 in response to resistance training with concomitant high-dose NSAID administration. Our hypothesis of a dose-dependent effect is also supported by the only comparable training study in young healthy subjects.14 That particular study reported no effect of ibuprofen on muscle hypertrophy or strength gains after 6 weeks of training consisting of six sets of biceps curls 2\u00963 days week---------------1 . The drug dose was consumed on training days only, resulting in a total intake of 800\u00961200 mg week---------------1 , 14 compared with 1200 mg per day in the current study. This indeed highlights the potential importance of drug dosage where, evidently, intake of maximal over-the-counter doses is potent enough to interfere with the normal hypertrophic development of 0.1\u00960.2% per day seen in the ASA group as well as in other studies employing conventional resistance-training programmes for the knee extensors.23 It is generally agreed that repeated increases in muscle protein synthesis following each exercise bout is the most important mechanism underlying training-induced muscle hypertrophy.26,27 Thus, it seems plausible to suggest that the main explanation for the clear attenuation of hypertrophy, which was evident in both training modes (FW and WS), was diminished prostaglandin production and hence decreased muscle protein synthetic response after each training session in the IBU group. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that COX and prostaglandins play an important role in regulating the molecular events controlling muscle hypertrophy. For example, C2C12 myotube diameter was shown to be regulated by PGF2a in an mTORdependent manner7 , and exercise-induced increases in p70S6K (downstream of mTOR) was blunted by ibuprofen treatment in the early hours following acute resistance exercise.13 In the current study, however, there were no group interactions for any of the target proteins examined, suggesting that the ibuprofenmodulating effect on muscle adaptations is not associated with differential expression of steady-state proteins in response to chronic training. Perhaps assessing satellite cell content,11 or the phosphorylation levels of translational signalling proteins in response to acute exercise,13 would have provided more mechanistic insights. We measured several key molecular markers for COX and prostaglandin-mediated metabolism, regulators of muscle growth and atrophy, and several cytokines and myokines that have been shown to regulate skeletal muscle protein metabolism and exercise adaptations.4 The most clear-cut molecular evidence for an effect of ibuprofen on peripheral muscle tissue was the marked drug effect on IL-6 mRNA, where levels in the ibuprofen group were downregulated despite a significant upregulation in the control group. The reduction of IL-6 in the ibuprofen group is coherent with previous studies suggesting PGE2 as a stimulator of IL-6 transcription in both human muscle28 and other cell types.29 It has previously been reported that the NSAID-modulating effects on muscle hypertrophy in older subjects were associated with lowered expression of IL-6 and subsequently MuRF-1, resulting in a more beneficial cellular environment for muscle growth.30 While our data are coherent with that of Trappe and colleagues regarding the expression of IL-6 in the ibuprofen-treated group (downregulated) compared to the control group (upregulated), the muscle hypertrophy data certainly contradict these findings. In that study, elderly subjects (60\u009678 years) performed 12 weeks of resistance training with simultaneous daily ibuprofen treatment of 1200 mg. The increase in muscle size was substantially greater with ibuprofen compared with placebo,15 and this was supported by acute data showing no interference of ibuprofen on muscle protein synthesis in the same age group.31 Thus, interestingly, there may be distinct differences in the response to resistance training and NSAID consumption in the young vs. the elderly, and probably also in the mechanistic underpinnings of exercise-induced tissue remodelling in these age groups. Specifically, in the present cohort of young subjects, it is possible that blunting of important inflammatory processes, as reflected by the downregulated IL-6 gene expression, contributed to the attenuated hypertrophic response because previous studies have shown that induction of IL-6, and also other inflammatory and proteolytic factors, has an important role in muscle regenerative processes during hypertrophic conditions.32,33 In contrast, the role of inflammatory processes may be different in the elderly where an ibuprofen-induced downregulation of IL-6 could reduce chronic low-grade inflammation and thereby restore the blunted anabolic response to resistance exercise typically seen in aged populations.34 Thus, based on the current data and given the complex regulation of mRNA and protein levels,35,36 future studies should directly compare the response to resistance exercise and NSAID treatment in young vs. old populations as well as incorporate better time resolution, including both acute and chronic biopsy time points and perhaps also higher-throughput techniques, to provide more conclusive evidence of the critical mechanisms regulating the interactive effects of NSAIDs and resistance exercise on muscle adaptations. The functional data showed that increases in muscle strength were attenuated in IBU compared with ASA, but only in the FW leg. In our mind, this leads to two questions: first, if this strength difference was explained by the larger increase in muscle size in the control group, why was strength not reduced in the WS leg? Second, if not muscle size, what other mechanisms could explain the fact that strength was negatively affected by ibuprofen only in the FW leg? Regarding the first question, although muscle mass and strength are generally highly correlated at baseline in pre-training situations,37,38 the same does not necessarily apply when it comes to increases in strength and muscle size following short-term resistance training.39,40 This was also the case in the current study, where in fact the correlation between changes in muscle size and strength was very weak (R2 ~0.05; data not shown). Thus, it appears that strength gains can occur irrespective of the magnitude of increase in muscle volume and hence, this could explain why, in the WS leg, the larger increase in muscle volume for the ASA group did not result in a larger increase in strength compared with IBU. It is plausible that with longer-term training, once neural adaptations have plateaued,41 the relationship between muscle size and strength would be restored and hence the negative effect of ibuprofen on strength would be even more evident. As to the second question raised above, we did speculate beforehand that perhaps NSAID consumption could affect acute training performance and thereby the capacity to perform high-intensity repetitive work bouts. It appeared at first that the strength reduction in the FW leg was not related to a reduction in day-to-day training performance, as both groups performed an equal amount of work throughout the 8-week training programme. Interestingly, however, a closer look at the data in Figure 1 reveals that the ibuprofen group certainly showed a levelling-off effect during the last week of flywheel training, which likely explains the lower strength gains noted. Regarding the logical follow-up question of why training performance in the FW leg was negatively affected by ibuprofen only at the end of the training period, we are unable to provide a definite answer. However, given that the main differences between the two training modes is the eccentric overload, provoking greater inflammatory stimulus, and the maximal unlimited resistance provided by the flywheel device,21,42 it is tempting to speculate that one (or both) of these two features are particularly prone to ibuprofen treatment, at least after a few weeks of accumulated training. It should also be noted that day-to-day performance levels varied much more in the FW leg, indicating that this training regime was more stressful for the subjects. Alternatively, as indicated earlier, the relationship between muscle mass and strength became more important at the end of the training period, and hence, the levelling-off phenomenon in the IBU group was due to the compromised hypertrophic development. Altogether, based on the current data and given the knowledge of different time resolutions for the underlying mechanisms of muscle strength, longer training studies could clarify whether interference in muscle growth will be associated with reduced muscle strength, and whether different training modes, such as eccentric overload, are even more sensitive to concomitant NSAID treatment. Notwithstanding, our findings raise the concern that resistance-training studies employing strict work-matched increases across groups might overlook important effects of various factors such as medical treatments or supplements that would have become evident if maximal efforts had been allowed throughout each set and training session. In summary, we show for the first time that maximal over-the-counter doses of NSAIDs compromise resistance exercise-induced increases in muscle size and strength in young adults. The gains in muscle size were attenuated by ibuprofen independent of the type of training performed, whereas muscle strength was attenuated only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. Furthermore, while the resistance-training intervention resulted in several muscle molecular adaptations, the only marked difference across medical treatment was a significant ibuprofen-induced reduction in IL-6 gene expression, which in our mind reflected a changed inflammatory environment that, speculatively, contributed to the attenuated hypertrophic development in the ibuprofen group. This study improves our understanding of how NSAIDs work and interacts with chronic exercise responses, and considering the potency of the drug to modify muscle mass and function, the mechanistic findings should contribute to a better understanding of regulation of muscle growth in general. More importantly, however, the results have implications for the millions of individuals worldwide who consume NSAIDs on a regular basis while trying to obtain the best possible benefits of resistance training. \nMethods \nEthical approval All subjects were given oral and written information about the study before giving written informed consent to participate. The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm and conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki. In agreement with EU legislation, the study was sanctioned by the Swedish Medical Products Agency (EudraCT-number: 2014-004872-47). The trial was registered as a clinical trial on ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier NCT02531451. Subjects All subjects (recreationally active men and women aged 18\u009635 years, Table 2) were recruited from the Stockholm region. Prior to inclusion, subjects completed a full medical screening including health and exercise history anamnesis and analysis of blood biochemistry. Exclusion criteria were current or previous cardiovascular disease, impaired kidney or liver function, auto-immune disease, lower limb or knee injury, pregnancy, history of ulcers or gastrointestinal upsets, or previous negative reactions to the use of NSAIDs. Subjects who had performed structured resistance training (more than once per week) for the past 6 months were also excluded. From the 48 individuals who were assessed for eligibility, 31 were included in the final data analysis (Fig. 7). Drug administration and accountability Each subject was given the whole batch of pills together with a medical diary on the first day of consumption (i.e. day 1 of the first training week). The ibuprofen group was instructed, orally and in writing, to take three doses/day (~08:00, ~14:00 and ~20:00 h.) corresponding to the maximal over-thecounter daily dose of 1200 mg (400 mg dose---------------1 ). The control group receiving acetylsalicylic acid was instructed to take one dose per day (75 mg) in conjunction with their morning meal. All subjects documented the time and date for each dose in the provided diary and were reminded about the importance of correct drug consumption on every visit to the exercise laboratory, and through text messages several times per week. The last day of medication was day 7 of the final (i.e. eighth) training week. After the 8-week training intervention, all subjects returned the medical diary and leftover medicines. All remaining pills were subsequently counted and compared with the written logs in the diary to control for drug compliance. Despite all these efforts, as no direct evidence of drug consumption was obtained, it remains possible that the subjects did not fully comply with these requirements. Nonetheless, all medicine administration and accountability were performed in agreement with the code of Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) by a certified external partner, the Clinical Pharmacology Trial Unit, at the Karolinska University Hospital in Huddinge, Stockholm. Thus, although the subjects were not blinded to their treatment, the research personnel responsible for monitoring training sessions stayed blind for the drug assignment during the whole intervention. The study hypothesis was never presented to the subjects.\n\nSafety procedures and adverse event reporting At every occasion where research staff met with the subjects (i.e. 2\u00963 times week---------------1 ), they were asked about any health complaints or suspected adverse reactions. Any adverse event was reported by study personnel to the principal investigator. If events occurred in the home or elsewhere during the study period, subjects were instructed to promptly report the incident to study staff who in turn would contact the principal investigator. All adverse events, or suspicion of such, were recorded in case report forms with symptoms, severity, date, time and assessment of potential relation to the study drugs. The medically responsible physician decided whether any further action (i.e. treatment or medication) was required. Exercise equipment and familiarization To elucidate whether ibuprofen affected day-to-day training performance, one leg was assigned to perform training with maximal volitional work allowed in each repetition using a flywheel ergometer, while on the other leg the training volume was matched between groups using regular weight-stack training. Thus, each of the subject\u0092s legs was randomized either to a non-gravity-dependent training device (YoYo Technology, Stockholm, Sweden) or a traditional weight-stack device (World Class, Stockholm, Sweden). The non-gravity-dependent device, hereafter flywheel or FW, was equipped with a 5-kg (men, inertia 0.075 kg m---------------2 or) or 3.5-kg (women, inertia 0.05 kg m---------------2 ) flywheel to provide inertial resistance during coupled concentric and eccentric actions. Peak concentric and eccentric power for each repetition was calculated from measures of rotational velocity (SmartCoach, Stockholm, Sweden). The weight-stack device (WS) employed constant external loading, that is isotonic loading. Weight plates of 5, 2 and 1 kg were used to set and adjust the load. The main difference between the two devices is that FW allows for maximal voluntary force to be produced from the very first repetition, whereas WS is dependent on the increasing exertion throughout each set, and maximal voluntary force is hence only offered in the last repetitions (i.e. close to failure). In addition, the FW offers brief episodes of eccentric overload.21 In both training devices, the subjects were seated (90\u00b0 hip angle, 80\u00b0 knee angle) and performed the concentric phase of the lift to ~175\u00b0 knee joint angle before entering the eccentric phase to ~80\u00b0 knee joint angle. Maximal isometric and isokinetic strength for the knee extensors were assessed using isokinetic dynamometry with a sampling frequency of 2000 Hz (Biodex System 4 Pro, Biodex Medical Systems, NY). The chest, hip and thigh were stabilized to the dynamometer using straps, and the ankle was strapped to the lever arm, which was aligned with the axis of rotation of the knee joint. To customize machine settings and familiarize subjects with the exercise procedures used during training and testing, all subjects reported to the laboratory for familiarization three times within 2 weeks prior to the start of the study. Pre- and post-testing All tests were performed using identical protocols both before (PRE) and after (POST) the 8-week training intervention. The tests were scheduled on three different days. First, baseline muscle strength assessments were performed. Maximal isometric strength (0\u00b0/s) and isokinetic strength (30\u00b0/s, 60\u00b0/s, 180\u00b0/s and 270\u00b0/s) were measured. The subjects were allowed two attempts on each velocity (30 s rest), and the best result was accepted as peak torque. Maximal isometric torque was measured at knee angle 120\u00b0. Subjects were instructed to push and hold the pressure against the lever for 5 s. The best attempt defined peak isometric torque. After a five-min rest period, trainingspecific strength was assessed. Thus, for the FW leg, peak power (averaged across sets and repetitions) was assessed for the flywheel device. The subjects performed 2 9 7 repetitions with two-min rests between sets. After another rest period of 5 min, one-repetition maximum (1-RM) strength was assessed in the WS leg. The goal was to reach 1-RM within five attempts. Subjects were instructed to raise the lever arm to ~175\u00b0 knee joint angle in order for the repetition to be accepted as 1-RM. Each attempt was separated by two-min rest. In all of the strength tests, strong verbal encouragement was given by the research staff to call for maximal effort. After 2 or 3 rest days, the muscle biopsy procedure was undertaken (see below). Four days after the biopsy procedure, once associated bleeding and swelling had settled, the MRI scan was performed (see below). During post-tests, the order of tests was maintained. However, as we wished to obtain the post-biopsies no more than 48 h after the last training session, the post-assessment of muscle strength was carried out during the final training week (prior to training session no. 18, and preceded by 48\u0096 72 h rest). The post-biopsies were then taken exactly 48 h (2 h) after the last training session, and the post-MRI scan was conducted 4 days later, that is 6 days after the training intervention ended. Magnetic resonance imaging Cross-sectional images were obtained using a 1.5- Tesla Siemens Magnetom Aera unit (Siemens Healthcare, Germany). The settings were as follows: Turbo spin echo, T2 weighted, TE 110 ms, TR 5723 ms, NSA 3, FOV 48.5 cm, scan time 4 min 50 s and voxel size 0.95 9 0.95 9 10 mm. Fifty continuous images with 10-mm slice thickness were obtained for each subject. To minimize the influence of fluid shift on muscle volume, subjects rested in the supine position for 1 h prior to any scan.43 A custom-made footrestrain device ensured a fixed-limb position and that there was no compression of thigh muscles. Preliminary localization (scout) images were obtained to confirm identical positioning across pre- and post-scans. To ensure that the same segment was scanned before and after training, the top of the caput femoris was used as an anatomical landmark when setting the window (field of view) for each scan. Although pre- and post-images were analysed in parallel, the individual who performed the analysis was blind with regard to all interventions. Muscle volume, mean cross-sectional area (CSA) and signal intensity (mean grey value, MGV) of the m. quadriceps femoris were analysed from the first image not displaying m. gluteus maximus and ending with the last image in which m. rectus femoris appeared.44 Within this segment (10\u0096 18 cm of the thigh), every third image was assessed by manual planimetry using imaging software (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The average of two measures showing less than 1% difference between values was multiplied by slice thickness to obtain muscle volume. Signal intensity was determined as a control measure to verify that any increase in muscle size would reflect true muscle hypertrophy rather than exercise-induced fluid infiltration or muscle swelling.20 Furthermore, as an additional control measure, we assessed the CSA of the untrained m. biceps femoris in the mid-thigh region. Training protocols The subjects performed 20 training sessions during the 8-week training intervention. The sessions were scheduled two and three times every other week, starting with two sessions the first week. All training was performed unilaterally. The subjects had their legs randomized in a counterbalanced fashion to FW on one leg and WS on the other, and this allocation was then preserved for the entire intervention. Each training session started with a standardized warm-up. After a two-min rest, the subjects performed 4 9 7 maximal repetitions on the FW device (two-min rest) and 4 9 8\u009612 repetitions to failure on the WS machine. The protocols were selected based on past research studies employing these particular exercise modes.2,20 The starting order of the machines was altered between every training session. In WS, the training load was progressively increased in a work-matched manner across groups. This was possible through the pair-matching procedure, that is, even though being blinded to the group assignment; the research staff ensured that each assigned pair did comparable amounts of total work throughout the study by manipulating the selected weight. Generally, the weight was progressively increased when the subject was able to perform more than 12 repetitions. In the FW, peak power was measured for each repetition and subjects were instructed, and verbally encouraged, to perform each repetition with maximal effort. Consequently, workload was per definition unlimited. Using this unilateral approach, it was possible to examine if ibuprofen had any effects on acute training performance or if any potential drug effects were unrelated to total work performed during training. Muscle biopsies Tissue samples of the vastus lateralis muscle were obtained under local anaesthesia using the percutaneous Bergstrom technique, \u0080 45 after an overnight fast and with no prior exercise during the past 48 h. Samples were taken from the right leg before training (PRE) and from each leg (WS and FW) 48 h (2 h) after the last training session (POST). All muscle samples (~200 mg) were immediately dissected free of any visible fat, excess blood and connective tissue, and then quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at ---------------80\u00b0C until the analyses. RNA isolation, reverse transcription and real-time PCR Wet muscle samples (20 mg) were homogenized using TRIzol (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and total RNA was subsequently extracted. One lg of total RNA from each sample was used for reverse transcription into cDNA for a final volume of 20 lL (High Capacity Reverse Transcription Kit, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Real-time PCR (ABI-PRISMA 7700 Sequence Detector, PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems) procedures were employed to determine mRNA expression. Probes and primers (TaqMan) for atrogin-1 (Hs00369714_m1), cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1; Hs00377726_m1), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2; Hs00153133_m1), interleukin 6 (IL-6; Hs00985639_m1), mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR; Hs00234522_m1), muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF-1; Hs00822397_m1), MyoD (Hs02330075_g1), myostatin (Hs00193363_m1), p70S6 kinase (p70S6K; Hs00177357_m1), prostaglandin E2 receptor 2 (PGE2 receptor; Hs00168754_m1), prostaglandin F receptor (PGF2a receptor; Hs00168763_m1), tumour necrosis factor (TNF-a; Hs01113624_g1), GAPDH (Hs99999905_m1) and RPS18 (Hs01375212_g1) were all purchased from Applied Biosystems. GAPDH and RPS18 were analysed as reference genes. However, final mRNA data were related only to RPS18 because this gene was stable across all time points and groups. Reaction and amplification mixes (10 lL) consisted of the diluted [1 : 5 (COX-2, PGF2a receptor, PGE2 receptor, IL-6, TNF-a)] or [1 : 100 (COX-1, p70S6K; mTOR, MyoD-1, myostatin, atrogin-1, MuRF-1)] cDNA (4.5 lL), TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (5.0 lL) and specific primers (0.5 lL). Subsequent cycling protocols were 2 min at 50\u00b0C and 10 min at 90\u00b0C followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. Target gene expression was reported as a ratio to the reference gene using the 2---------------DCT formula. Protein extraction and immunoblot analysis Muscle samples (~30 mg) cleansed from visible blood, fat and connective tissue were freeze-dried and subsequently homogenized in ice-cold buffer (100 lL mg---------------1 dry wt) consisting of 2 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X 100, 2 mM dithiothreitol and 1.5% (v/v) phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktail (HaltTM, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, MD, USA) using a BulletBlender (NextAdvance, Averill Park, NY, USA) with 0.5 mm ZrO beads. The homogenates obtained were rotated for 60 min at 4\u00b0C and subsequently centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The resulting supernatant was collected and stored at ---------------80\u00b0C. Protein concentrations were determined in aliquots of supernatant diluted 1 : 10 in distilled water using the Pierce 660 nm protein assay (Thermo Scientific). Muscle homogenates were diluted with 49 Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA) and homogenizing buffer to obtain a final protein concentration of 1.4 lg lL---------------1 . Subsequently, all samples were heated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min to denature proteins and then stored at ---------------20\u00b0C until further analysis. As an additional control to confirm a stable muscle contractile fraction from PRE to POST, we assessed estimated muscle water content by relating the dry muscle weight to the wet weight,20 as measured on a precision microbalance at standardized temperature and humidity. The immunoblotting procedures were performed as described by Apro et al.46 with slight modifications for this study. Samples containing total protein of 40 lg were separated by SDS\u0096polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on 18-well Criterion TGX gradient gels (4\u009620% acrylamide; Bio-Rad). Both ASA and IBU samples were loaded on each gel, and each sample from each subject was always loaded onto the same gel, beginning with the PRE sample followed by POST right and POST left leg respectively. The blots were quantified using the Quantity One software from Bio-Rad. To control for appropriate loading and transfer, target proteins were expressed relative to whole-lane analysis of protein content obtained by staining the membranes with MemCode Reversible Protein Stain Kit (Thermo Scientific).47 The monoclonal primary antibodies used for the detection of target total proteins were the following: mTOR (7C10; no. 2983; 1 : 1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA); p70S6K (49D7; no. 2708; 1 : 1000; Cell Signaling Technology); TNF-a (D5G9; no. 6945; 1 : 500; Cell Signaling Technology); MyoD1 (D8G3; XP; no. 13812; 1 : 500; Cell Signaling Technology); and MuRF-1 (C-11; no. sc-398608; 1 : 1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Heidelberg, Germany). The secondary antibodies used were all from Cell Signaling Technology: anti-rabbit (1 : 10 000; mTOR, p70S6k), (1 : 5000; MyoD-1), (1 : 2000; TNF-a) and anti-mouse (1 : 10 000; MuRF-1) IgG antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Statistics Independent t-tests were used to compare descriptive data for the two groups. Data distribution was manually checked on histograms for any marked skewness. Subsequently, two-way ANOVAs with factors group (ASA vs. IBU) and time (PRE vs. POST) were used to compare training-induced changes in all dependent variables across the two groups. The magnitude of the effects of key outcome variables (muscle size and strength) was further assessed using Cohen\u0092s effect size (d) and associated 90% confidence limits to estimate the size and precision of mean group differences (i.e. the difference in change scores from pre to post). Group differences of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 were considered as trivial, small, moderate and large effect sizes respectively.48 The significance level was set to 5% (P < 0.05).

ST exhibited greater explosive torque, early RTD, and greater MFCV with respect to controls throughout the contraction. When explosive torque was normalized to maximal torque, ST had a higher RTD at the beginning of the contraction (0\u009650 ms). Moreover, a greater absolute and normalized conduction velocity (MFCVMAX) during the EMD and in the first 50 ms of torque generation was observed for the ST group. This result indicates a recruitment of motor units with greater conduction velocities. This is the first study showing that ST may recruit larger motor units in a shorter amount of time.\n\nMuscle Fiber Conduction Velocity\nThe average MFCV values are in agreement with previous reports of MFCV during steady-state contractions. For example, Farina et al. reported estimates of MFCV in the BB during isometric steady-state contractions at 50% MVC of ~4.6 m/s (30). Zwarts and Arendt-Nielsen estimated MFCV at high contraction forces of the BB and reported values ranging between 3.22 and 5.11 m/s (57). MFCV average values in the present study were also in agreement with estimates of single-motor unit conduction velocities using intramuscular EMG recordings during voluntary and electrical activation of the BB muscle. Moreover, the present estimates are also in accordance with other studies involving different muscular contractions and protocols (25, 26, 32, 41, 42, 47, 48).\n\nInterestingly, only two studies assessed MFCV in power athletes and only during electrical stimulation and maximal voluntary contractions (43, 49). Sadoyama et al. reported a significantly higher maximal MFCV in a group of trained sprinters compared with endurance runners (4.84 vs. 4.31 m/s; 49). Moreover, they reported a significant relation between the relative area of fast-twitch fibers and conduction velocity (49).\n\nRecently, Methenitis et al. estimated MFCV during electrical stimulation of muscle fibers in endurance runners and power-trained and ST individuals and separately measured RTD (43). They reported significant relations between MFCV, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, and rate of force development (43). However, estimates of MFCV were assessed during electrical stimulation and thus separately from the voluntary generation of explosive force. Therefore, it was not possible to associate the underlying neural strategies of muscle control with explosive force performance. Collectively, these previous results indicate that MFCV may be an indicator of muscle explosive performance, although no previous study assessed MFCV during explosive torque generation.\n\nExplosive Torque and RTD\nThe RTD was significantly greater for ST during the early phase of explosive torque generation (Fig. 3A). However, when the moment-time curve was normalized to the maximal strength, the RTD for the resistance-trained subjects was significantly different only in the first 50 ms of the contraction (Fig. 3B). Because the relative explosive torque at 150 and 200 ms from contraction onset was similar between the two groups, the controls developed higher RTD during the second and third time windows from force onset (Fig. 3B).\n\nPrevious studies found an increase in the EMG amplitude and rate of force development in the initial phase of contraction after 4 wk of explosive training (7). In addition, a greater normalized rate of force development in the first 50 ms of contraction was found for power athletes during knee extensor explosive torque (51). Because the first 50 ms of contraction strongly reflect neural activation (13, 15, 16, 54), strength or power training presumably increases RTD by a faster recruitment of motor units, as discussed below.\n\nMFCV During the Explosive Phase of Contraction\nST individuals have the ability to develop higher levels of force in the first 50 ms of contraction. This seems to be associated with greater MFCV in the same time interval, which indicates recruitment of motor units with greater conduction velocity. The role of motor unit recruitment during explosive force contraction is not well understood because it is not possible to identify representative populations of motor units in very short time intervals.\n\nThe primary determinant of motor unit twitch force is the number of muscle fibers innervated by the axon (17, 53). Motor unit peak twitch forces in humans range from ~6 to ~78 mN\u00b7m with maximal tetanic forces ranging from ~30 to ~200 mN\u00b7m (36, 38). Therefore, one of the mechanisms that determined the increase in RTD during the first 0\u009650-ms interval in the ST may have been the recruitment of larger motor units with greater and faster twitches. There is evidence showing correlations between electrically evoked twitch torque and early voluntary rate of force development, which could be associated with the differences in muscle fiber composition and/or Ca2+ saturation for the trained individuals (3, 34).\n\nInterestingly, the two groups showed similar EMD values, which is in accordance with a previous study that compared the EMD in power-trained and untrained cohorts (51). This finding is, however, contradictory with a higher MFCV during the EMD. A higher absolute MFCV value should theoretically anticipate the release of Ca2+ and thus the rise in force. However, these problems may be related to the techniques employed in assessing the delay between the neural and muscular apparatus. The EMD during explosive contractions may not be sensitive to differences in neural activation due to a compressed recruitment (12, 15). We have recently shown that when the EMD is assessed as the time difference between the neural drive and force during the sustained contractions, the central nervous system modulates the delay broadly and according to the rate of force development (12). Indeed, the neuromechanical delay seems to be predominantly influenced by the type of recruited motor units and the intrinsic properties of the motor neuron (5, 12). Future studies assessing the neuromechanical delay in strength/power-trained individuals may be warranted.\n\nMFCV increases with voluntary force production due to the relation between motor unit recruitment thresholds and fiber diameter (4, 8, 11, 35). This association implies that the ordered recruitment of motor units may be assessed by estimates of conduction velocity (10). We have recently reported that large, high-threshold motor units innervate fibers with large diameter (11), which explains the association between motor unit mechanical properties and conduction velocity previously reported (4). Moreover, we have recently demonstrated that the increase in average MFCV during voluntary force contractions is associated with the progressive recruitment of motor units with increasing conduction velocity and predicts recruitment thresholds at the individual subject level (10).\n\nIn the present study, MFCV was the average of the conduction velocities of the active motor units during explosive force contractions, in time intervals of 50 ms following EMG onset. We showed that there may be significant differences in the recruited motor units during explosive tasks in ST compared with moderately active individuals. Absolute MFCV values were greater in ST throughout the full duration of the explosive contractions (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the early absolute and normalized MFCV were positively associated with RTD (Fig. 4). Because absolute MFCV values are linearly related to the diameters of muscle fibers, higher absolute conduction velocity values may indicate that ST have muscle fibers with larger diameters due to the strength training-induced hypertrophy (43) compared with controls (24, 43).\n\nHowever, when MFCV values were normalized to the maximal value during MVF (full motor unit recruitment), ST had a significantly greater MFCV-rel during the initial phase of the explosive contractions. Specifically, MFCV-relEMD and MFCV-rel0\u009650 were on average ~9% greater (Fig. 4B). This suggests that during the early phase of explosive force, ST have the ability to recruit motor units with faster conduction velocities in a shorter time. It takes ~100 ms more for the controls to reach similar values of normalized MFCV compared with the ST group. Interestingly, the changes in conduction velocity did not differ between groups (Fig. 4, A and B), and the MFCV plateaued in the interval 50\u0096100 ms, which can be interpreted as full motor unit recruitment (10). This interpretation is in agreement with previous studies reporting that most motor units are recruited at one-third of maximal force during explosive contractions (15, 16). Moreover, MFCV increased in all subjects from the EMD to 0\u009650 ms, indicating that the ordered recruitment according to the size of the motor unit was preserved during the explosive tasks in both groups.\n\nThe underlying mechanism that may determine an increase in explosive force for the ST individuals may be an anticipated recruitment of high-threshold motor units with high conduction velocities. The difference between MFCV of high- and low-threshold motor units within a muscle is ~2 m/s (11). A faster motor unit recruitment (and conduction velocity) would achieve greater peak mechanical torques in a shorter time. The release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is correlated to the speed of the action potential on the fiber membrane (21). Indeed, MFCV is related to motor unit time-to-peak twitch forces (4). The increase in MFCV may potentially allow a faster calcium uptake and thus anticipating the rise in force.\n\nVan Cutsem et al. reported an increase in motor unit discharge rates following ballistic training (55) and concluded, in agreement with other studies, that RTD depends on motor unit discharge rate (16, 18, 55). On the other hand, the recruitment threshold of motor units significantly influences the discharge rate at a given absolute force (18). Anticipating the recruitment of high-threshold motor units would result in reaching motor unit peak discharge rate and motor unit peak RTD in a shorter time. Accordingly, in the present study, MFCV was positively associated with RTD (Fig. 4A), suggesting that motor unit recruitment may play an important role in explosive force production.\n\nInterestingly, the correlation between RTD0\u009650 and early MFCV values (MFCVEMD,0\u009650) was different for the ST and untrained individuals. MFCV0\u009650 was not correlated with RTD0\u009650 in the ST group (Fig. 4). This result indicates that ST completed the motor unit recruitment during the very early phase of explosive force, i.e., between the EMD and the first 50 ms from contraction onset (Fig. 4B). The increase in MFCV during the explosive force at the 50- and 100-ms time points for the ST is presumably due to some subjects continuing the recruitment while the subjects with higher RTD achieved a faster plateau in MFCV (Fig. 4). Indeed, it took more time for the untrained individuals to reach high MFCV (and full motor unit recruitment) values (Figs. 3 and 4).\n\nIt must be noted that the number of subjects in the present study may be too low for a correlation study. Moreover, the cross-sectional design cannot isolate the innate and environmental factors that contributed to the explosive force and MFCV differences found between the cohorts. However, in the present study the trained individuals performed combined strength and explosive training for >3 yr. Recent evidence showed a significant increase in explosive force production after 12 wk of isometric explosive training compared with isometric sustained-contraction strength training (6). The large differences in the early RTD for the trained subjects in the present study may also indicate that the neural contributors to explosive strength could be related to chronic exposure to explosive/strength training and that the neural adaptations may continue over time. Future studies assessing the neural contributors to explosive force in large cohorts and longitudinal (>1 yr) interventions are warranted.\n\nConclusion\nResistance-trained individuals showed higher RTD and explosive force in the very early phase of contraction that was accompanied by an increase in absolute and normalized MFCV compared with controls. These observations may be explained by recruitment of fast-twitch motor units (i.e., large motor units with large muscle fiber diameters) in a shorter amount of time in the resistance-trained cohort than in controls. In addition to the functional implications in the study of human explosive force, the study also presents a methodology that may be applied in the assessment of the neural strategies of muscle control in health, training, and pathology.\nPage 1 of 1\n\n", "folder": "2023-06-14 full2", "system_role": "You are a journalist writing content based on science research articles.", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 1000, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613", "qna": {"date": "2023-06-14 1713", "folder": "2023-06-14 full2", "article_title": "Higher muscle fiber conduction velocity and early rate of torque development in chronically strength-trained individuals", "system_role": "You are a journalist writing content based on science research articles.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613", "text": "Higher muscle fiber conduction velocity and early rate of torque development in chronically strength-trained individuals\n\nDISCUSSION\nMFCV was measured during explosive force contractions in a group of resistance-trained individuals and a control cohort.
