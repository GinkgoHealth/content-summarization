Introduction
Decreases in muscle mass, function, and neuromuscular activation are significant factors contributing to the decline in the quality of life during the aging process (21,26). However, the majority of research investigating the effect of aging has primarily focused on comparing adults older than 60 years with younger adult populations in their second, third, or fourth decade of life (7,1618,25). It seems that only a single study is known that has compared young and middle-aged (4059 years) adults on strength performance and recovery (28). Understanding changes in muscle function as adults move from young to middle-age may provide for a better understanding of how to minimize the significant declines in muscle function as one reaches retirement age.
Changes in recovery from a bout of exercise may be associated with the aging process (12). Recovery is often determined by the return of performance measures to baseline (BL) levels or by an attenuation of the inflammatory or muscle damage response to exercise (15,35). Previous research has reported a decrease in the magnitude of the immune response in older adults (e.g., >65 years) compared with younger adults after maximal graded exercise tests on a treadmill (8) and on an electrically braked cycle ergometer (27). Such a decline may be indicative of a delay in recovery because the inflammatory response is thought to play a major role in muscle remodeling and recovery (37). Decreases in muscle mass and strength associated with aging have been suggested to impair the recovery process after exercise, by increasing the time to adaptation or muscle repair (7,33). Previously, recovery from resistance exercise has been reported to be impaired in recreationally trained (36 hours of exercise per week) older adults (?69 years) compared with younger adults (38). Similarly, McLester et al. (28) reported a delay in recovery (e.g., in repetitions performed up to 96 hours after exercise) from a total body resistance exercise program in middle-aged men (56 ± 5 years) compared with younger men (23 ± 5 years). By contrast, other investigations have reported no difference in recovery between younger and older populations when assessing recovery through electrically stimulated muscle contraction (1,23). The differences between these studies are likely related to differences in the mode of exercise, training intensity, and pretraining status (1,23,28,38). Furthermore, only one of these investigations included men with resistance training experience (28). Considering the differences noted between younger and older adults, examining changes in recovery as one moves from young to older age may provide a better understanding regarding reducing age-associated performance decreases. Therefore, the primary purpose of this investigation was to compare the recovery response between young (1830 years) and middle-aged men (4059 years) from an acute high-volume isokinetic resistance exercise workout. A secondary purpose was to compare the effects of this workout on markers of inflammation and muscle damage during the 48-hour recovery period.
Methods
Experimental Approach to the Problem
A parallel study design was used to determine the effects of a single bout of high-volume isokinetic resistance exercise on changes in muscle strength, as well as markers of muscle damage, and the inflammatory response between young (1830 years) and middle-aged adults (4059 years). Before data collection, all participants reported to the Human Performance Laboratory (HPL) for anthropometric assessment and familiarization with training and assessment protocols. Participants then returned to the HPL to perform a high-volume resistance exercise protocol. Testing was performed before and immediately after the resistance training protocol. Recovery assessments (both performance, muscle damage and inflammatory) were also assessed at 24 and 48 hours after exercise.
Subjects
Nineteen recreationally trained men volunteered to participate in this investigation. Study participants were recruited and placed into 2 groups based on age. The young adult (YA) group consisted of men between the ages of 1830 years, whereas the middle-aged (MA) group consisted of men between the ages of 4059 years. None of the participants were competitive athletes, and all were recreationally resistance-trained at study enrollment. Inclusion criteria required participants to meet the age requirements of one of the groups and be recreationally active, including resistance training for the previous 6 months before enrollment as defined by the American College of Sports Medicine (150 minutes of exercise per week) (14). All participants were free of any physical limitations that may have affected performance and were not using any medications, dietary supplements, or any other performance-enhancing drugs before or during the study as determined by a health and activity questionnaire. After an explanation of all procedures, risks, and benefits, each participant gave his written informed consent before participation in this study. The Institutional Review Board of the University of Central Florida approved the research protocol. Experimental group characteristics are presented in Table 1.
Procedures
Both groups reported to the HPL on 4 separate occasions. On the first visit (D1), participants reported to the HPL after a 2-hour fast. Anthropometric assessments were performed and included height, body mass, and body composition. After anthropometric assessments, participants performed a standardized warm-up consisting of 5 minutes of pedaling on a cycle ergometer at 50 watts. After the warm-up, participants completed a familiarization protocol on the isokinetic device (S4; Biodex Medical System, Inc., New York, NY, USA). On the second visit (D2), participants arrived after a 10-hour fast and recorded their subjective levels of pain and soreness on a visual analog scale (VAS). There were at least 48 hours between the first and second visits, with no more than 7 days between these 2 visits. After the VAS, participants then provided a BL blood sample followed by an ultrasound (US) assessment of the vastus lateralis (VL) of their right leg. Participants then performed the first lower-body performance assessment protocol (BL). After a 5-minute rest period, participants completed the high-volume isokinetic resistance exercise protocol (HVP), followed immediately post (IP) by another lower-body performance assessment protocol. Blood samples were obtained at IP, 30 (30P), 60 (60P), and 120 minutes (120P) after the exercise protocol. Ultrasound assessments were obtained at IP and 120P, whereas an additional VAS assessment was completed at 30P. Participants reported to the HPL 24 (24 H) and 48 hours (48 H) after D2 for lower-body assessments. In addition, blood draws, US, and VAS measures were also obtained. The order of lower-body assessment, VAS, blood draw, and US measures were the same for all testing sessions. Figure 1 displays the study procedures and timeline.
Dietary Recall
All participants provided a 3-day dietary recall beginning the day before D2 testing until the morning of 48 H testing. Participants were asked to maintain their regular diet for the duration of the investigation. FoodWorks nutrient analysis software (McGraw-Hill, New York, NY, USA) was used to analyze the self-reported dietary recalls for total kilocalorie intake and macronutrient distributions (carbohydrate, protein, and fat).
Anthropometric Assessment
Body mass (±0.1 kg) and height (±0.1 cm) were measured using a Health-o-meter Professional scale (Patient Weighing Scale, Model 500 KL; Pelstar, Alsip, IL, USA). Body composition was assessed using a multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analyzer (InBody 770; Cerritos, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
Visual Analog Scale
Participants were instructed to assess their subjective feelings of pain and soreness using a 100-mm VAS (23). Participants were asked to rate pain and soreness intensity by placing a mark on a horizontal 100-mm VAS (5,29). Verbal anchors were used at each end of the scale representing no pain or soreness and the worst possible soreness or pain. The VAS was performed at BL, IP, 30P, 24 H, and 48 H.
Ultrasound Assessments
All US assessments were performed on the VL of the right leg as previously described (39). Participants were asked to lay supine on an examination table with both legs fully extended for a minimum of 5 minutes to allow fluid shifts to occur (2). Before image collection, all anatomical locations of interest were identified using standardized landmarks for the VL muscle. The length of the VL encompassed the distance from the lateral condyle of the tibia to the most prominent point of the greater trochanter of the femur. The VL measurement required the participant to lay on their side, whereas cross-sectional area (CSA) and muscle thickness (MT) measurements were obtained from the US. The sampling location was determined by the point of intersection between the VL and 50% of the straight-line distance between the greater trochanter and the lateral epicondyle of the femur (39). After determining the desired anatomical position, a linear probe coated with transmission gel was positioned on the surface of the skin to collect the US image. For all US measurements, a 12 MHz probe (LOGIQ P5; General Electric, Wauwatosa, WI, USA) coated with water-soluble transmission gel (Aquasonic 100; Parker Laboratories, Inc., Fairfield, NJ, USA) was passed over the surface of the thigh at the predetermined anatomical locations outlined above. The depth was set at 6.0 cm, gain at 50 dB, and dynamic range at 72. Further analysis of US images was performed offline using image analysis software (ImageJ, version 1.45 s) available from the National Institutes of Health (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). All US images were obtained and analyzed by the same technician. Test-related reliability for all US measurements was determined by using 10 different subjects (not participants from this study) examined 2448 hours apart. Intraclass correlation coefficients and minimal differences (MD) were determined for CSA (R = 0.99; MD = 0.85 cm2) and MT (R = 0.97; MD = 0.09 cm).
Isokinetic Assessment Protocol
The isokinetic assessment protocol was performed at BL, IP, 120P, 24 H, and 48 H to quantify performance decrements and recovery as a result of the HVP. Participants were seated in the isokinetic dynamometer (S4; Biodex Medical System, Inc.), positioned with a hip angle of 110° and strapped into the chair at the waist, shoulders, and across the thigh. Chair and dynamometer settings were adjusted for each participant to correctly align the axis of rotation with the lateral condyle of the femur. All participants were tested on their right leg, which was secured to the dynamometer arm just above the medial and lateral malleoli. The lever arm of the dynamometer was programmed to extend the participant's leg to 155° of knee flexion (where 180° is a full extension) and flex the participant's leg to 85 degrees of flexion. Isokinetic dynamometer settings for each individual were recorded and remained consistent throughout the study. The isokinetic assessment protocol at each time point consisted of 2 maximal voluntary isometric contractions performed at a 70° angle, 1 set of 3 repetitions of concentric knee extension at 240°·s?1 with passive knee flexion to starting position, and 1 set of 3 repetitions of concentric knee extension at 60°·s?1 with a passive knee flexion to starting position. Of the 3 maximal repetitions, the highest peak torque (PKT) and average torque (AVGT) were recorded for each speed.
High-Volume Isokinetic Resistance Exercise Protocol
After the isokinetic assessment protocol at BL on D2, the participant remained seated, and the HVP was performed. The HVP consisted of 8 sets of 10 repetitions of concentric knee extension and eccentric knee flexion at 60°·s?1. A 1-minute rest interval was provided between each set. Participants were encouraged to provide maximal effort throughout the HVP. Work performed in each set of the HVP was calculated as the product of the mean power of each kick over the time to complete the kick. Total work done was calculated as the sum of the work performed in each of the 8 sets of 10 repetitions during the HVP.
Blood Collection
Blood samples were obtained at 7 time points throughout the study (BL, IP, 30P, 60P, 120P, 24 H, and 48 H). The BL, IP, 30P, 60P, and 120P blood samples were obtained using a Teflon cannula placed in a superficial forearm vein using a 3-way stopcock with a male luer lock adapter and a plastic syringe after arrival to the HPL on D2. The cannula was maintained patent using a nonheparinized isotonic saline solution (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). All blood samples were obtained after a 15-minute equilibration period with the exception of the IP blood draw. During the remaining time points (24 H and 48 H), blood was obtained by a single-use disposable needle with the participant lying in a supine position for at least 15 minutes before sampling. Blood draws during 24 H and 48 H were obtained after a 10-hour fast. A total of 20 ml of whole blood was collected at each time point in serum and K2EDTA-treated Vacutainer tubes, (Becton Dickinson). Blood in the K2EDTA tubes was immediately centrifuged at 4,000g for 15 minutes, then placed into 1.8-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and frozen at ?80° C for later analysis. Blood in the serum tubes was allowed to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes and then subsequently centrifuged, aliquoted, and stored through the same procedure.
Biochemical Analyses
Serum concentrations of creatine kinase (CK) were analyzed with the use of a commercially available kinetic assay kit (Sekisui Diagnostics, Charlottetown, PE, Canada) as per manufacturer's instructions. C-reactive protein (CRP) and myoglobin (Mb) concentrations were obtained through commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (CRP; R&D Systems; Minneapolis, MN, USA) (Mb: Calbiotech, Spring Valley, CA, USA), whereas interleukin-6 (IL-6) was obtained through high-sensitivity multiplex assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). To eliminate interassay variability, all samples for a particular assay were thawed once and analyzed by the same technician using a BioTek Eon spectrophotometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT). All samples were analyzed in duplicate with a mean coefficient of variation of 4.50% for CK, 7.38% for CRP, 3.55% for IL-6, and 5.03% for Mb. All biochemical assays were run as per the manufacturer's instructions.
Statistical Analyses
Performance measures were analyzed through repeated measures analysis of covariance to control for BL differences between the groups. Changes in subjective levels of pain and soreness, as well as markers of inflammation and muscle damage, were analyzed through repeated measures analysis of variance. In the event of a significant F value, least significant difference post hoc tests were used for pairwise comparison. Baseline performance comparisons of both groups were determined by independent t-tests. Outliers were identified when values exceeded 1.5 times the interquartile range (3). For all analyses, a criterion alpha level of ? ? 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Data were analyzed using SPSS v23 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All data are reported as a mean ± SD.
Results
Performance Measures
Isometric Assessments
Unadjusted isometric performance measures are depicted in Table 2. One participant from YA was identified as an outlier and removed from all study analyses. Baseline comparisons between YA and MA revealed that YA had significantly greater AVGT (p = 0.043), rate of torque development at 200 ms (RTD200) (p = 0.033), and a trend toward a greater isometric PKT (p = 0.057) during the isometric assessment than MA. After controlling for BL, examination of the recovery response from the HVP revealed no significant group × time interactions for PKT (F = 1.009; p = 0.377), AVGT (F = 0.997; p = 0.402), or for RTD200 (F = 0.225; p = 0.879). There were also no significant main effects of time for PKT (F = 0.281; p = 0.759), AVGT (F = 0.289; p = 0.833), or RTD200 (F = 0.073; p = 0.974).
Isokinetic Assessment
Unadjusted isokinetic performance measures are depicted in Table 2. No significant differences at BL were noted between the groups; however, a trend toward a greater PKT at both 240°·s?1 (F = 0.081; p = 0.061) and 60°·s?1 (F = 1.562; p = 0.083) was observed for YA compared with MA. After controlling for BL, no significant group × time interactions were observed for PKT at either 240°·s?1 (F = 0.681; p = 0.503) or 60°·s?1 (F = 0.450; p = 0.656). In addition, there were no significant main effects for time observed for PKT at either 240°·s?1 (F = 0.272; p = 0.746) or 60°·s?1 (F = 0.109; p = 0.910) for both groups combined.
No significant difference at BL was found for AVGT at 60°·s?1 (F = 0.940; p = 0.148), but a trend toward a greater AVGT was noted in YA at 240°·s?1 (F = 0.008; p = 0.094). When controlling for BL, no significant group × time interactions were observed for AVGT at 240°·s?1 (F = 0.897; p = 0.404) or 60°·s?1 (F = 0.769; p = 0.484). In addition, no significant main effects for time were noted for AVGT at either 240°·s?1 (F = 0.228; p = 0.762) or 60°·s?1 (F = 0.155; p = 0.878).
Blood Analyses
Changes in CK and Mb can be found in Figures 2 and 3, respectively, whereas changes in CRP and IL-6 can be observed in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. No significant group × time interactions were observed for Mb (F = 0.307; p = 0.640), CK (F = 0.607; p = 0.551), CRP (F = 0.320; p = 0.602), or IL-6 (F = 0.466; p = 0.589). However, significant main effects for time were observed for both Mb (F = 8.708; p = 0.005) and CK (F = 8.127; p = 0.001). Myoglobin was significantly higher at 30P (p = 0.002), 60P (p = 0.001), and 120P (p = 0.007) compared with BL, whereas CK concentrations at 24 H (p = 0.002) and 48 H (p = 0.006) were significantly higher than BL. Although no significant main effect for time was observed for CRP (F = 3.042; p = 0.097), a significant main effect was noted for IL-6 (F = 3.689; p = 0.05). Changes in IL-6 were significantly elevated from BL at 30P (p = 0.032), 120P (p = 0.002), 24 H (p = 0.007), and 48 H (p = 0.034) for both groups combined.
Visual Analog Scales
Changes in subjective feelings of pain and soreness can be observed in Table 3. No significant group × time interactions were observed for subjective measures of pain (F = 0.102; p = 0.959) or soreness (F = 0.886; p = 0.455). No significant main effect for time was observed for subjective levels of pain (F = 1.085; p = 0.351); however, a significant main effect for time was observed for subjective levels of muscle soreness (F = 7.319; p = < 0.001) in both groups combined. Muscle soreness was significantly higher at 30P (p = 0.001), 24 H (p = 0.001), and 48 H (p = 0.002) compared with BL.
Ultrasound Assessment
Changes in muscle CSA and MT can be observed in Table 3. No significant group × time interactions were observed for muscle CSA (F = 0.246; p 0.747) or MT (F = 0.687; p = 0.530). However, a significant main effect for time was observed for both CSA (F = 13.460; p < 0.001) and MT (F = 3.685; p = 0.028). Muscle CSA and MT were significantly greater at IP (p < 0.001) compared with BL.
Discussion
Results of this study indicated no differences in the recovery response between YA and MA for any of the performance measures, nor in subjective levels of muscle pain or soreness. Furthermore, no between-group differences were observed in the inflammatory or muscle damage response to the exercise protocol. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine differences in the recovery response from high-volume resistance exercise between recreationally trained young and middle-aged adults. Our results comparing BL performance measures seem to be in agreement with other investigations, demonstrating differences in strength measures between young (2329 years) and older adults (6065 years) (7,15,24), and between middle-aged (4142 years) and older adults (7072 years) (17,18). It does seem that the decline in strength may develop during middle age. However, recovery from exercise seems to be comparable in both younger and middle-aged adults as reflected by similar changes in performance and markers of muscle damage and inflammation. Although changes in strength may occur in middle age, recovery from exercise does seem to be maintained in recreationally trained individuals.
The differences observed at BL in isometric force and the rate of force development is consistent with other investigations comparing younger and older adults (16,19,36). Although differences in age between young and middle-aged adults do seem to affect BL levels of strength, it does not seem to affect recovery from exercise. This is supported by similar patterns of muscle damage and inflammation observed during the recovery period after the HVP. Elevations in Mb and CK concentrations are consistent with the expected physiological response from a bout of resistance exercise (9,34). These results also suggest that middle-aged recreationally active men who regularly engage in resistance training do not seem to be at increased risk for greater soreness or muscle damage in comparison with younger recreationally trained men.
Similar response patterns were also noted in the inflammatory response for both groups. No significant elevations from BL were observed in CRP. However, significant increases in IL-6 concentrations were observed for both groups. Although CRP is an acute phase protein whose function is to activate the innate immune response and enhance phagocytosis (10), it does not seem to change after an acute bout of resistance exercise (6). Previous research has reported no significant changes in CRP concentrations after resistance training protocols recruiting primarily both upper-body (31) and lower-body exercises (4) in younger men. Furthermore, previous investigations have also indicated that training experience can reduce the CRP response to an acute bout of exercise (22,35). Considering that participants in both YA and MA were recreationally trained, it is likely that this training experience may have attenuated the CRP response. Physiologically, it is consistent with the lower stress and damage that occurs with repetitive training (9,35). Interleukin-6 is an inflammatory cytokine that facilitates communication for the mobilization, proliferation, and differentiation of immune cells to the site of tissue damage (6) and has been shown to increase after exercise (11). Elevations in IL-6 are related to the intensity, duration, and mode of training (11,13,32), but the literature is inconclusive regarding the IL-6 response to resistance training. A recent study reported that a bout of high-volume resistance exercise (8 sets of 10 repetitions with 70% of maximal strength in the squat exercise) resulted in a significant elevation in IL-6 concentrations 30 min after exercise, but no changes were observed after a bout of high-intensity resistance exercise (8 sets of 3 repetitions with 90% of maximal strength in the squat exercise) in experienced, trained lifters (4). The IL-6 response observed during this investigation as a result of a bout of high-volume resistance exercise seems to be consistent with that recently reported by Bartolomei et al. (4). However, age did not seem to exacerbate nor attenuate the IL-6 response in recreationally trained participants.
No differences were noted in the inflammatory or muscle damage response between YA and MA. As discussed earlier, this is likely related to the recreational training background of the participants. However, there were several limitations to the study that need to be acknowledged. The exercise protocol was performed on an isokinetic dynamometer, which may not have as much practical application as most resistance training programs use dynamic constant resistance exercises. In addition, unilateral, single-joint exercise recruited a relatively smaller muscle mass than is commonly used in most training programs. The use of this modality of exercise, which has been demonstrated to be very effective in eliciting muscle damage (20,30), may not have been sufficient to elicit significant performance and inflammatory changes in these recreationally trained participants. Future research should examine modes of training specific to the typical training program of the participants.
Practical Applications
The results of this study indicate that changes in muscle performance seem to begin during middle age, even in recreationally trained individuals. However, participating in recreational resistance training may mitigate any alteration in the recovery response from exercise. These results should be examined in the context that recovery was investigated after a unilateral, single-joint isokinetic exercise protocol. Although this method has been previously used as an effective mode of exercise to elicit muscle damage, it is not specific to the type of exercises typically used by recreational lifters. Future studies may wish to compare these population groups using multijoint, dynamic constant resistance exercises common to the training programs of most recreational lifters, regardless of age.","1.

Introduction
Decreases in muscle mass, function, and neuromuscular activation are significant factors contributing to the decline in the quality of life during the aging process (21,26). However, the majority of research investigating the effect of aging has primarily focused on comparing adults older than 60 years with younger adult populations in their second, third, or fourth decade of life (7,1618,25). It seems that only a single study is known that has compared young and middle-aged (4059 years) adults on strength performance and recovery (28). Understanding changes in muscle function as adults move from young to middle-age may provide for a better understanding of how to minimize the significant declines in muscle function as one reaches retirement age.
Changes in recovery from a bout of exercise may be associated with the aging process (12). Recovery is often determined by the return of performance measures to baseline (BL) levels or by an attenuation of the inflammatory or muscle damage response to exercise (15,35). Previous research has reported a decrease in the magnitude of the immune response in older adults (e.g., >65 years) compared with younger adults after maximal graded exercise tests on a treadmill (8) and on an electrically braked cycle ergometer (27). Such a decline may be indicative of a delay in recovery because the inflammatory response is thought to play a major role in muscle remodeling and recovery (37). Decreases in muscle mass and strength associated with aging have been suggested to impair the recovery process after exercise, by increasing the time to adaptation or muscle repair (7,33). Previously, recovery from resistance exercise has been reported to be impaired in recreationally trained (36 hours of exercise per week) older adults (?69 years) compared with younger adults (38). Similarly, McLester et al. (28) reported a delay in recovery (e.g., in repetitions performed up to 96 hours after exercise) from a total body resistance exercise program in middle-aged men (56 ± 5 years) compared with younger men (23 ± 5 years). By contrast, other investigations have reported no difference in recovery between younger and older populations when assessing recovery through electrically stimulated muscle contraction (1,23). The differences between these studies are likely related to differences in the mode of exercise, training intensity, and pretraining status (1,23,28,38). Furthermore, only one of these investigations included men with resistance training experience (28). Considering the differences noted between younger and older adults, examining changes in recovery as one moves from young to older age may provide a better understanding regarding reducing age-associated performance decreases. Therefore, the primary purpose of this investigation was to compare the recovery response between young (1830 years) and middle-aged men (4059 years) from an acute high-volume isokinetic resistance exercise workout. A secondary purpose was to compare the effects of this workout on markers of inflammation and muscle damage during the 48-hour recovery period.
Methods
Experimental Approach to the Problem
A parallel study design was used to determine the effects of a single bout of high-volume isokinetic resistance exercise on changes in muscle strength, as well as markers of muscle damage, and the inflammatory response between young (1830 years) and middle-aged adults (4059 years). Before data collection, all participants reported to the Human Performance Laboratory (HPL) for anthropometric assessment and familiarization with training and assessment protocols. Participants then returned to the HPL to perform a high-volume resistance exercise protocol. Testing was performed before and immediately after the resistance training protocol. Recovery assessments (both performance, muscle damage and inflammatory) were also assessed at 24 and 48 hours after exercise.
Subjects
Nineteen recreationally trained men volunteered to participate in this investigation. Study participants were recruited and placed into 2 groups based on age. The young adult (YA) group consisted of men between the ages of 1830 years, whereas the middle-aged (MA) group consisted of men between the ages of 4059 years. None of the participants were competitive athletes, and all were recreationally resistance-trained at study enrollment. Inclusion criteria required participants to meet the age requirements of one of the groups and be recreationally active, including resistance training for the previous 6 months before enrollment as defined by the American College of Sports Medicine (150 minutes of exercise per week) (14). All participants were free of any physical limitations that may have affected performance and were not using any medications, dietary supplements, or any other performance-enhancing drugs before or during the study as determined by a health and activity questionnaire. After an explanation of all procedures, risks, and benefits, each participant gave his written informed consent before participation in this study. The Institutional Review Board of the University of Central Florida approved the research protocol. Experimental group characteristics are presented in Table 1.
Procedures
Both groups reported to the HPL on 4 separate occasions. On the first visit (D1), participants reported to the HPL after a 2-hour fast. Anthropometric assessments were performed and included height, body mass, and body composition. After anthropometric assessments, participants performed a standardized warm-up consisting of 5 minutes of pedaling on a cycle ergometer at 50 watts. After the warm-up, participants completed a familiarization protocol on the isokinetic device (S4; Biodex Medical System, Inc., New York, NY, USA). On the second visit (D2), participants arrived after a 10-hour fast and recorded their subjective levels of pain and soreness on a visual analog scale (VAS). There were at least 48 hours between the first and second visits, with no more than 7 days between these 2 visits. After the VAS, participants then provided a BL blood sample followed by an ultrasound (US) assessment of the vastus lateralis (VL) of their right leg. Participants then performed the first lower-body performance assessment protocol (BL). After a 5-minute rest period, participants completed the high-volume isokinetic resistance exercise protocol (HVP), followed immediately post (IP) by another lower-body performance assessment protocol. Blood samples were obtained at IP, 30 (30P), 60 (60P), and 120 minutes (120P) after the exercise protocol. Ultrasound assessments were obtained at IP and 120P, whereas an additional VAS assessment was completed at 30P. Participants reported to the HPL 24 (24 H) and 48 hours (48 H) after D2 for lower-body assessments. In addition, blood draws, US, and VAS measures were also obtained. The order of lower-body assessment, VAS, blood draw, and US measures were the same for all testing sessions. Figure 1 displays the study procedures and timeline.
Dietary Recall
All participants provided a 3-day dietary recall beginning the day before D2 testing until the morning of 48 H testing. Participants were asked to maintain their regular diet for the duration of the investigation. FoodWorks nutrient analysis software (McGraw-Hill, New York, NY, USA) was used to analyze the self-reported dietary recalls for total kilocalorie intake and macronutrient distributions (carbohydrate, protein, and fat).
Anthropometric Assessment
Body mass (±0.1 kg) and height (±0.1 cm) were measured using a Health-o-meter Professional scale (Patient Weighing Scale, Model 500 KL; Pelstar, Alsip, IL, USA). Body composition was assessed using a multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analyzer (InBody 770; Cerritos, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
Visual Analog Scale
Participants were instructed to assess their subjective feelings of pain and soreness using a 100-mm VAS (23). Participants were asked to rate pain and soreness intensity by placing a mark on a horizontal 100-mm VAS (5,29). Verbal anchors were used at each end of the scale representing no pain or soreness and the worst possible soreness or pain. The VAS was performed at BL, IP, 30P, 24 H, and 48 H.
Ultrasound Assessments
All US assessments were performed on the VL of the right leg as previously described (39). Participants were asked to lay supine on an examination table with both legs fully extended for a minimum of 5 minutes to allow fluid shifts to occur (2). Before image collection, all anatomical locations of interest were identified using standardized landmarks for the VL muscle. The length of the VL encompassed the distance from the lateral condyle of the tibia to the most prominent point of the greater trochanter of the femur. The VL measurement required the participant to lay on their side, whereas cross-sectional area (CSA) and muscle thickness (MT) measurements were obtained from the US. The sampling location was determined by the point of intersection between the VL and 50% of the straight-line distance between the greater trochanter and the lateral epicondyle of the femur (39). After determining the desired anatomical position, a linear probe coated with transmission gel was positioned on the surface of the skin to collect the US image. For all US measurements, a 12 MHz probe (LOGIQ P5; General Electric, Wauwatosa, WI, USA) coated with water-soluble transmission gel (Aquasonic 100; Parker Laboratories, Inc., Fairfield, NJ, USA) was passed over the surface of the thigh at the predetermined anatomical locations outlined above. The depth was set at 6.0 cm, gain at 50 dB, and dynamic range at 72. Further analysis of US images was performed offline using image analysis software (ImageJ, version 1.45 s) available from the National Institutes of Health (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). All US images were obtained and analyzed by the same technician. Test-related reliability for all US measurements was determined by using 10 different subjects (not participants from this study) examined 2448 hours apart. Intraclass correlation coefficients and minimal differences (MD) were determined for CSA (R = 0.99; MD = 0.85 cm2) and MT (R = 0.97; MD = 0.09 cm).
Isokinetic Assessment Protocol
The isokinetic assessment protocol was performed at BL, IP, 120P, 24 H, and 48 H to quantify performance decrements and recovery as a result of the HVP. Participants were seated in the isokinetic dynamometer (S4; Biodex Medical System, Inc.), positioned with a hip angle of 110° and strapped into the chair at the waist, shoulders, and across the thigh. Chair and dynamometer settings were adjusted for each participant to correctly align the axis of rotation with the lateral condyle of the femur. All participants were tested on their right leg, which was secured to the dynamometer arm just above the medial and lateral malleoli. The lever arm of the dynamometer was programmed to extend the participant's leg to 155° of knee flexion (where 180° is a full extension) and flex the participant's leg to 85 degrees of flexion. Isokinetic dynamometer settings for each individual were recorded and remained consistent throughout the study. The isokinetic assessment protocol at each time point consisted of 2 maximal voluntary isometric contractions performed at a 70° angle, 1 set of 3 repetitions of concentric knee extension at 240°·s?1 with passive knee flexion to starting position, and 1 set of 3 repetitions of concentric knee extension at 60°·s?1 with a passive knee flexion to starting position. Of the 3 maximal repetitions, the highest peak torque (PKT) and average torque (AVGT) were recorded for each speed.
High-Volume Isokinetic Resistance Exercise Protocol
After the isokinetic assessment protocol at BL on D2, the participant remained seated, and the HVP was performed. The HVP consisted of 8 sets of 10 repetitions of concentric knee extension and eccentric knee flexion at 60°·s?1. A 1-minute rest interval was provided between each set. Participants were encouraged to provide maximal effort throughout the HVP. Work performed in each set of the HVP was calculated as the product of the mean power of each kick over the time to complete the kick. Total work done was calculated as the sum of the work performed in each of the 8 sets of 10 repetitions during the HVP.
Blood Collection
Blood samples were obtained at 7 time points throughout the study (BL, IP, 30P, 60P, 120P, 24 H, and 48 H). The BL, IP, 30P, 60P, and 120P blood samples were obtained using a Teflon cannula placed in a superficial forearm vein using a 3-way stopcock with a male luer lock adapter and a plastic syringe after arrival to the HPL on D2. The cannula was maintained patent using a nonheparinized isotonic saline solution (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). All blood samples were obtained after a 15-minute equilibration period with the exception of the IP blood draw. During the remaining time points (24 H and 48 H), blood was obtained by a single-use disposable needle with the participant lying in a supine position for at least 15 minutes before sampling. Blood draws during 24 H and 48 H were obtained after a 10-hour fast. A total of 20 ml of whole blood was collected at each time point in serum and K2EDTA-treated Vacutainer tubes, (Becton Dickinson). Blood in the K2EDTA tubes was immediately centrifuged at 4,000g for 15 minutes, then placed into 1.8-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and frozen at ?80° C for later analysis. Blood in the serum tubes was allowed to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes and then subsequently centrifuged, aliquoted, and stored through the same procedure.
Biochemical Analyses
Serum concentrations of creatine kinase (CK) were analyzed with the use of a commercially available kinetic assay kit (Sekisui Diagnostics, Charlottetown, PE, Canada) as per manufacturer's instructions. C-reactive protein (CRP) and myoglobin (Mb) concentrations were obtained through commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (CRP; R&D Systems; Minneapolis, MN, USA) (Mb: Calbiotech, Spring Valley, CA, USA), whereas interleukin-6 (IL-6) was obtained through high-sensitivity multiplex assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). To eliminate interassay variability, all samples for a particular assay were thawed once and analyzed by the same technician using a BioTek Eon spectrophotometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT). All samples were analyzed in duplicate with a mean coefficient of variation of 4.50% for CK, 7.38% for CRP, 3.55% for IL-6, and 5.03% for Mb. All biochemical assays were run as per the manufacturer's instructions.
Statistical Analyses
Performance measures were analyzed through repeated measures analysis of covariance to control for BL differences between the groups. Changes in subjective levels of pain and soreness, as well as markers of inflammation and muscle damage, were analyzed through repeated measures analysis of variance. In the event of a significant F value, least significant difference post hoc tests were used for pairwise comparison. Baseline performance comparisons of both groups were determined by independent t-tests. Outliers were identified when values exceeded 1.5 times the interquartile range (3). For all analyses, a criterion alpha level of ? ? 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Data were analyzed using SPSS v23 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All data are reported as a mean ± SD.
Results
Performance Measures
Isometric Assessments
Unadjusted isometric performance measures are depicted in Table 2. One participant from YA was identified as an outlier and removed from all study analyses. Baseline comparisons between YA and MA revealed that YA had significantly greater AVGT (p = 0.043), rate of torque development at 200 ms (RTD200) (p = 0.033), and a trend toward a greater isometric PKT (p = 0.057) during the isometric assessment than MA. After controlling for BL, examination of the recovery response from the HVP revealed no significant group × time interactions for PKT (F = 1.009; p = 0.377), AVGT (F = 0.997; p = 0.402), or for RTD200 (F = 0.225; p = 0.879). There were also no significant main effects of time for PKT (F = 0.281; p = 0.759), AVGT (F = 0.289; p = 0.833), or RTD200 (F = 0.073; p = 0.974).
Isokinetic Assessment
Unadjusted isokinetic performance measures are depicted in Table 2. No significant differences at BL were noted between the groups; however, a trend toward a greater PKT at both 240°·s?1 (F = 0.081; p = 0.061) and 60°·s?1 (F = 1.562; p = 0.083) was observed for YA compared with MA. After controlling for BL, no significant group × time interactions were observed for PKT at either 240°·s?1 (F = 0.681; p = 0.503) or 60°·s?1 (F = 0.450; p = 0.656). In addition, there were no significant main effects for time observed for PKT at either 240°·s?1 (F = 0.272; p = 0.746) or 60°·s?1 (F = 0.109; p = 0.910) for both groups combined.
No significant difference at BL was found for AVGT at 60°·s?1 (F = 0.940; p = 0.148), but a trend toward a greater AVGT was noted in YA at 240°·s?1 (F = 0.008; p = 0.094). When controlling for BL, no significant group × time interactions were observed for AVGT at 240°·s?1 (F = 0.897; p = 0.404) or 60°·s?1 (F = 0.769; p = 0.484). In addition, no significant main effects for time were noted for AVGT at either 240°·s?1 (F = 0.228; p = 0.762) or 60°·s?1 (F = 0.155; p = 0.878).
Blood Analyses
Changes in CK and Mb can be found in Figures 2 and 3, respectively, whereas changes in CRP and IL-6 can be observed in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. No significant group × time interactions were observed for Mb (F = 0.307; p = 0.640), CK (F = 0.607; p = 0.551), CRP (F = 0.320; p = 0.602), or IL-6 (F = 0.466; p = 0.589). However, significant main effects for time were observed for both Mb (F = 8.708; p = 0.005) and CK (F = 8.127; p = 0.001). Myoglobin was significantly higher at 30P (p = 0.002), 60P (p = 0.001), and 120P (p = 0.007) compared with BL, whereas CK concentrations at 24 H (p = 0.002) and 48 H (p = 0.006) were significantly higher than BL. Although no significant main effect for time was observed for CRP (F = 3.042; p = 0.097), a significant main effect was noted for IL-6 (F = 3.689; p = 0.05). Changes in IL-6 were significantly elevated from BL at 30P (p = 0.032), 120P (p = 0.002), 24 H (p = 0.007), and 48 H (p = 0.034) for both groups combined.
Visual Analog Scales
Changes in subjective feelings of pain and soreness can be observed in Table 3. No significant group × time interactions were observed for subjective measures of pain (F = 0.102; p = 0.959) or soreness (F = 0.886; p = 0.455). No significant main effect for time was observed for subjective levels of pain (F = 1.085; p = 0.351); however, a significant main effect for time was observed for subjective levels of muscle soreness (F = 7.319; p = < 0.001) in both groups combined. Muscle soreness was significantly higher at 30P (p = 0.001), 24 H (p = 0.001), and 48 H (p = 0.002) compared with BL.
Ultrasound Assessment
Changes in muscle CSA and MT can be observed in Table 3. No significant group × time interactions were observed for muscle CSA (F = 0.246; p 0.747) or MT (F = 0.687; p = 0.530). However, a significant main effect for time was observed for both CSA (F = 13.460; p < 0.001) and MT (F = 3.685; p = 0.028). Muscle CSA and MT were significantly greater at IP (p < 0.001) compared with BL.
Discussion
Results of this study indicated no differences in the recovery response between YA and MA for any of the performance measures, nor in subjective levels of muscle pain or soreness. Furthermore, no between-group differences were observed in the inflammatory or muscle damage response to the exercise protocol. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine differences in the recovery response from high-volume resistance exercise between recreationally trained young and middle-aged adults. Our results comparing BL performance measures seem to be in agreement with other investigations, demonstrating differences in strength measures between young (2329 years) and older adults (6065 years) (7,15,24), and between middle-aged (4142 years) and older adults (7072 years) (17,18). It does seem that the decline in strength may develop during middle age. However, recovery from exercise seems to be comparable in both younger and middle-aged adults as reflected by similar changes in performance and markers of muscle damage and inflammation. Although changes in strength may occur in middle age, recovery from exercise does seem to be maintained in recreationally trained individuals.
The differences observed at BL in isometric force and the rate of force development is consistent with other investigations comparing younger and older adults (16,19,36). Although differences in age between young and middle-aged adults do seem to affect BL levels of strength, it does not seem to affect recovery from exercise. This is supported by similar patterns of muscle damage and inflammation observed during the recovery period after the HVP. Elevations in Mb and CK concentrations are consistent with the expected physiological response from a bout of resistance exercise (9,34). These results also suggest that middle-aged recreationally active men who regularly engage in resistance training do not seem to be at increased risk for greater soreness or muscle damage in comparison with younger recreationally trained men.
Similar response patterns were also noted in the inflammatory response for both groups. No significant elevations from BL were observed in CRP. However, significant increases in IL-6 concentrations were observed for both groups. Although CRP is an acute phase protein whose function is to activate the innate immune response and enhance phagocytosis (10), it does not seem to change after an acute bout of resistance exercise (6). Previous research has reported no significant changes in CRP concentrations after resistance training protocols recruiting primarily both upper-body (31) and lower-body exercises (4) in younger men. Furthermore, previous investigations have also indicated that training experience can reduce the CRP response to an acute bout of exercise (22,35). Considering that participants in both YA and MA were recreationally trained, it is likely that this training experience may have attenuated the CRP response. Physiologically, it is consistent with the lower stress and damage that occurs with repetitive training (9,35). Interleukin-6 is an inflammatory cytokine that facilitates communication for the mobilization, proliferation, and differentiation of immune cells to the site of tissue damage (6) and has been shown to increase after exercise (11). Elevations in IL-6 are related to the intensity, duration, and mode of training (11,13,32), but the literature is inconclusive regarding the IL-6 response to resistance training. A recent study reported that a bout of high-volume resistance exercise (8 sets of 10 repetitions with 70% of maximal strength in the squat exercise) resulted in a significant elevation in IL-6 concentrations 30 min after exercise, but no changes were observed after a bout of high-intensity resistance exercise (8 sets of 3 repetitions with 90% of maximal strength in the squat exercise) in experienced, trained lifters (4). The IL-6 response observed during this investigation as a result of a bout of high-volume resistance exercise seems to be consistent with that recently reported by Bartolomei et al. (4). However, age did not seem to exacerbate nor attenuate the IL-6 response in recreationally trained participants.
No differences were noted in the inflammatory or muscle damage response between YA and MA. As discussed earlier, this is likely related to the recreational training background of the participants. However, there were several limitations to the study that need to be acknowledged. The exercise protocol was performed on an isokinetic dynamometer, which may not have as much practical application as most resistance training programs use dynamic constant resistance exercises. In addition, unilateral, single-joint exercise recruited a relatively smaller muscle mass than is commonly used in most training programs. The use of this modality of exercise, which has been demonstrated to be very effective in eliciting muscle damage (20,30), may not have been sufficient to elicit significant performance and inflammatory changes in these recreationally trained participants. Future research should examine modes of training specific to the typical training program of the participants.
Practical Applications
The results of this study indicate that changes in muscle performance seem to begin during middle age, even in recreationally trained individuals. However, participating in recreational resistance training may mitigate any alteration in the recovery response from exercise. These results should be examined in the context that recovery was investigated after a unilateral, single-joint isokinetic exercise protocol. Although this method has been previously used as an effective mode of exercise to elicit muscle damage, it is not specific to the type of exercises typically used by recreational lifters. Future studies may wish to compare these population groups using multijoint, dynamic constant resistance exercises common to the training programs of most recreational lifters, regardless of age.","1.

Subject line: New research shows the benefits of resistance training as we age!

Hey! I just read an interesting study that compared the recovery response from resistance exercise between young and middle-aged men. The researchers found that participating in recreational resistance training can help minimize the decline in muscle function as we reach middle age. The study included 19 recreationally trained men, and they performed a high-volume isokinetic resistance exercise protocol. The results showed no significant differences in the recovery response between the two age groups, indicating that middle-aged individuals who regularly engage in resistance training are not at increased risk for greater muscle soreness or damage compared to younger individuals. This suggests that resistance training can help maintain muscle recovery as we age. Pretty cool, right?

Let me know if you want more details or if you're interested in starting a resistance training routine!"

INTRODUCTION
Pain is recognized as a public health problem (1). Chronic pain [i.e., pain that persists for ?3 mo (2)] in particular, affects ?20% of the global population (3, 4), with negative consequences to the individual, society, healthcare, and the economy. In the United States, the annual cost of chronic pain is estimated to be $635 millionmore than that of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes combined (5). However, chronic pain treatment has proven difficult due to the complex and multifactorial nature of pain (6). In a survey conducted across several European countries, 40% of chronic pain sufferers reported feeling dissatisfied with the effectiveness of their pain treatment(s) (4). Hence, more research on the mechanisms and factors contributing to a persons pain experience is needed. Given the various complexities of studying chronic pain (e.g., ethical, logistical, and medical considerations), such research is usually performed by administering various acute experimental pain stimuli to healthy individuals.

Recent studies have shown that hypohydration can increase experimental pain sensitivity (7, 8). Mild hypohydration of <1% body mass loss, induced by prior fasting and exercise, was found to decrease pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) during a cold pressor task in men, compared with when they were rehydrated (7). These findings were supported in a later study, where subjective ratings of cold pressor pain in men were higher after 24 h of fluid restriction (1.4% body mass loss) than in the euhydrated condition (8). Similarly, a field study showed that hypohydrated cyclists perceived more intense pain in their leg muscles during an ultra-endurance race, compared with the euhydrated cyclists (9). However, these studies were primarily performed in men and the effects of hypohydration on pain in women have not been formally investigated.

Several chronic pain conditions are more prevalent among women than men (10). Women also tend to display greater sensitivity to various experimental pain stimuli (11). Furthermore, pain perception in women may be influenced by hormonal fluctuations (primarily 17?-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle (12, 13). It is generally agreed that the severity of pain symptoms in several chronic pain conditions varies across the menstrual cycle (13, 14); however, whether the menstrual phase affects experimental pain sensitivity in healthy, pain-free women is still contestable (15, 16). The lack of accurate verification of menstrual phases and presence of various potential confounders (e.g., dysmenorrhea, dietary, and lifestyle factors) in many studies could explain the inconsistent findings (15). Some studies have attempted to address these issues (e.g., see Refs. 17 and 18), but such studies are scant and did not appear to impose a progesterone threshold to ensure only ovulatory cycles were included (19). Notably, none of the previous studies measured hydration status of participants at the time of testing, which may be influenced by menstrual phase (20, 21).

The ovarian hormones affect body fluid regulatory mechanisms (22), with potential implications for hydration status (20, 21). The mid-luteal phase (high 17?-estradiol and progesterone) is associated with an earlier release of arginine vasopressin (AVP)a fluid-regulatory hormone that increases renal water retentionand thirst during exercise-induced dehydration or hypertonic saline infusion, compared with the early follicular phase (low 17?-estradiol and progesterone) (23, 24). This may potentially reduce the severity of dehydration for a given hydration challenge in the mid-luteal phase (20, 21). In the context of pain, this may suggest: 1) differences in the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration in the early follicular compared with mid-luteal phase, 2) potential variability in hydration status across the menstrual cycle may have confounded previous research on effects of the menstrual phase and experimental pain sensitivity, and 3) hypohydration may reduce the efficacy of pain treatments in women (21).

Importantly, mild hypohydration appears to be common among women, with data from the United States showing approximately half of the 7,855 surveyed women meeting the hypohydration criterion (plasma tonicity > 295 mmol·L?1) (25). Therefore, the current study investigated the effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in women. We also examined whether the negative consequences of hypohydration on pain could be remedied by acute water ingestion. We hypothesized that 1) hypohydration would increase experimental pain sensitivity in women, 2) the magnitude of this increase in pain sensitivity would differ between the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases, and 3) acute water ingestion would reverse the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration.

METHODS
Ethical Approval
The study was approved by the Massey University Human Ethics Committee: Southern A (18/66). The study conformed to the requirements of the US Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (45 CFR, Part 46), and the standards set by the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki, except for registration in a database. All participants provided written, informed consent before all trials. Researchers were not blinded to the experimental conditions and analyses.

Participants
Twenty-three healthy, eumenorrheic women initially volunteered for this study. As this is the first study, to our knowledge, that has investigated the effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase in combination, there was no reference study to base our sample size calculations on. As such, sample size was estimated from two previous studies; one on hypohydration and pain (? = 0.79 and effect size = 0.53) (8) and the other on a meta-analysis on menstrual phase effects on pain (effect size = 0.5 for ischemic pain, ? = 0.80) (12), which yielded required sample sizes of n = 17 and n = 27, respectively at an ? = 0.05. Therefore, we aimed for 17 > n < 27 and estimated the required number of participants for sufficient power to be n = 22.

Six participants did not proceed with the experimental trials due to scheduling difficulties; thus, 17 women completed all experimental trials [means (SD): age, 28 (8) yr; height, 1.63 (0.07) m; body mass, 65.0 (10.8) kg]. Participants reported having regular menstrual cycles (i.e., 2135 days) at the time of recruitment and had not used hormonal contraceptives within the past 6 mo. All participants were nonsmokers, had no pre-existing or history of medical, psychiatric, pain-related, or menstrual-related disorders (e.g., dysmenorrhea, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and premenstrual syndrome), and were not taking any medications. Taking into consideration these inclusion/exclusion criteria, women aged > 18 < 50 yr were recruited. All participants, except for one, were recreationally physically active, engaging in at least 150 min of structured exercise per week.

Experimental Overview
Participants attended the laboratory on six occasions: two familiarization sessions, followed by four experimental trials. The four experimental trials were a full crossover of menstrual phase (EF and ML) and hydration status [euhydrated (EUH) and hypohydrated (HYPO)] and were performed over one or two menstrual cycles. The order of the experimental trials was randomized and counterbalanced, but the order of EUH and HYPO for each participant was maintained in the different menstrual phases. The experimental trials for each participant began at the same time of day (±1 h) to minimize diurnal variation in pain sensitivity (26) and ovarian hormone concentrations (27). All trials were separated by at least 48 h and were performed under standard environmental conditions (22°C, 50% relative humidity, room illuminance of 600 lx).

Familiarization
Before the experimental trials, participants were familiarized with the ischemic pain test (see Ischemic Pain Test) on two separate occasions to minimize potential learning and anxiety effects. The first familiarization session also included measurement of participants height and body mass (for calculation of fluid volume), and assessment of their maximal handgrip strength (see Maximal Handgrip Strength Assessment) to determine the absolute intensity for the submaximal contractions during the ischemic pain test. The number of familiarization sessions was determined from preliminary assessment of the time course of the learning effects, where pain outcome measures appeared to plateau after two sessions.

Maximal Handgrip Strength Assessment
Using their nondominant hand, participants performed three maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) with a handgrip dynamometer (MLT003 Grip Force Transducer, ADInstruments Inc., CO) (28). Participants were asked to squeeze the dynamometer maximally for 5 s during each MVC, separated by 1 min of rest. Force output from the dynamometer was recorded (PowerLab, ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand) and displayed in real-time (LabChart Pro, ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand). Maximal handgrip strength was determined by calculating the mean of the peak values for the three MVCs. This assessment was only conducted once during the first familiarization session, rather than at the start of each experimental trial, to prevent potential effects of the MVCs on subsequent pain sensitivity (28). Furthermore, maximal handgrip strength does not appear to be affected by menstrual phase (19, 29) or hypohydration (30, 31).

Dietary and Lifestyle Control
Participants refrained from pain-relieving medications, alcohol, and strenuous exercise at least 12 h before the start of each experimental trial. Participants also maintained their habitual caffeine intake over this 24-h period to minimize confounding effects of caffeine on pain sensitivity (32) and psychological variables (33, 34). To prevent caffeine withdrawal during the hypohydrated trials, participants who normally consumed caffeinated beverages were given a caffeine tablet (No-Doz Awakeners, Novartis Consumer Health, Inc.) to take in place of the beverages. Participants recorded their diet, physical activity, and time to bed and wake (i.e., sleep duration) during the 24-h period before their first trial and were asked to replicate these for subsequent trials. Participants completed a dietary and lifestyle record sheet at the start of each trial to assess adherence to these instructions.

Menstrual Cycle Phase and Hydration Intervention
Participants were tested during the EF and ML phases of their menstrual cycle to maximize the phase difference in ovarian hormone concentrations. The EF trials took place on days 4 (1) and 6 (2) and the ML trials on days 20 (2) and 22 (2), with day 1 representing start of menses and assuming a conventional 28-day menstrual cycle. Testing was scheduled using the three-step method (35) whereby self-reported menses onset and urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) testing (EasyCheck Ovulation Test, Phoenix Medcare, Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand) prospectively identified EF and ML, whereas measurement of serum 17?-estradiol and progesterone retrospectively confirmed ML. The EF phase was further verified by 17?-estradiol concentrations that were lower than in ML. Participants started daily LH testing 16 days before the end of a typical cycle until a positive LH test result was obtained (confirmed visually by the researchers), with ML trials then scheduled six to ten days after the positive LH test. To ensure ovulation had occurred and to minimize the likelihood of including anovulatory or luteal phase-deficient cycles, participants with progesterone < 5 ng·mL?1 were excluded from the final analyses (19, 36).

Twenty-four hours before each trial, participants were instructed to either restrict fluid intake and avoid consumption of high-water content foods (>50%, e.g., soups, vegetables, and fruits) (HYPO), or to drink ad libitum (EUH). Participants recorded their food and fluid intake over this 24-h period retrospectively at the start of each trial (see Dietary and Lifestyle Control and Experimental Protocol).

Experimental Protocol
Upon the participants arrival at the laboratory, a blood sample was obtained from the antecubital vein of the dominant arm via venepuncture. Participants then provided a urine sample and had their body mass measured. Urine specific gravity (USG) was measured immediately to confirm euhydration (USG < 1.020) or hypohydration (USG ? 1.020) (37). Participants then completed the dietary and lifestyle record sheet, Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (EUH only; see Measurements) and thirst ratings, followed by the ischemic pain test.

Immediately after the pain test, participants ingested a glass of water (5 mL·kg?1 of body mass measured during the first familiarization) and finished it within 5 min. This volume of water was previously shown to produce an immediate decrease in thirst perception in hypohydrated men (38). A 30-min break followed, during which participants remained in the laboratory and performed their activity of choice (e.g., reading and watching videos) that was consistent for all trials. After the break, participants repeated the thirst ratings and ischemic pain test. The duration of the break was determined based on previous data that examined the reliability of pressure pain measurements taken before and after 30 min of rest (39). Pain thresholds at both time points were not different; however, pain ratings decreased after the 30-min break in women, but not in men. Although this suggests that more than 30 min may be required to ameliorate carryover effects, especially in women, we decided on 30 min to prevent boredom and restlessness since participants had to remain in the laboratory during this period.

Ischemic Pain Test
The ischemic pain test consisted of the Submaximal Effort Tourniquet Procedure (40). This experimental pain stimulus was chosen as it is more clinically relevant than other pain stimuli (e.g., noxious heat, mechanical pressure, and electrical stimulation) (41). A pneumatic cuff was positioned on the participants nondominant arm, just above the elbow joint. The participants arm was passively raised to a vertical position for 30 s to promote venous drainage. The pneumatic cuff was then inflated to 250 mmHg and a stopwatch was started. The participants arm was immediately lowered to a horizontal position on the table, such that the forearm rests on the table with the elbow joint at a 90° angle. To promote forearm ischemia, participants performed 25 handgrip exercises at 30% of their predetermined maximum handgrip strength (see Familiarization). Each contraction was sustained for 2 s and followed by 2 s of rest. Auditory signals indicated the start and end of each contraction. Participants received continuous visual feedback of their force output and the target force on a laptop screen.

Upon completion of the handgrip exercises, the cuff remained inflated on the participants arm and participants watched a nature documentary to standardize their attention throughout the remainder of the pain test. The volume of the video was maintained at 30% for all trials. One minute after the end of the handgrip exercises, participants rated their pain intensity and unpleasantness on a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) (42). Participants were asked to indicate verbally when they were no longer able or willing to endure the pain (pain tolerance). The stopwatch was then stopped; just before the cuff was deflated, participants rated their pain intensity and unpleasantness again, to verify that they had reached pain tolerance. Unknown to participants, a maximum time limit of 20 min was enforced for the pain test.

Measurements
Anthropometric.
Participants height and body mass were measured using a stadiometer (Seca, Hamburg, Germany; accurate to 0.1 cm) and electronic scale (Model X3M, HIWEIGH Technologies Limited, Shanghai, China; accurate to 10 g), respectively.

Ovarian hormone concentrations.
Venous blood was collected into two 10 mL vacutainer tubes (Becton-Dickson, Oxford, UK). One tube contained clot activator for analysis of serum osmolality (Sosm), 17?-estradiol, and progesterone concentrations, whereas the other tube contained K3EDTA for analysis of plasma copeptin. The tube containing clot activator was inverted gently and left to clot for a minimum of 30 min at room temperature. The whole blood in both tubes was then centrifuged (Centrifuge 5804 R, Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) at 4°C and 260 g for 15 min to separate serum and plasma from whole blood. Aliquots of serum and plasma were then separated into three Eppendorf tubes (Genuine Axygen Quality) each and stored at ?80°C for further analysis. Commercially available enzyme-linked immune assays were used to measure concentrations of 17?-estradiol (Demeditec Diagnostics, Kiel, Germany) and progesterone (IBL International, Hamburg, Germany) in serum samples, with a sensitivity of 6.2 pg·mL?1 and 0.045 ng·mL?1, respectively, and an intra-assay variation of <6% and <7%, respectively. The ratio of progesterone to 17?-estradiol (P4:E2 ratio) was then calculated (43).

Hydration status.
Hydration status was assessed by measurement of Sosm, plasma copeptin concentrations, USG, ratings of thirst perception, and percent body mass change. Serum osmolality was measured via freezing-point depression (Digimatic osmometer Model 3D2, Advanced Instruments, Inc., Norwood, MA). Measurements were made in duplicate and averaged. If the two measurements differed by more than 5%, a third measurement was taken and the average of the two closest values was calculated. Plasma copeptin concentrations, a surrogate marker for AVP (44, 45), were measured with an automated immunofluorescent Copeptin proAVP KRYPTOR assay (B·R·A·H·M·S KRYPTOR compact PLUS analyzer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Henningsdorf, Germany), with a sensitivity of 1.08 pmol·L?1. Urine specific gravity was measured using a handheld clinical refractometer (Clinical Refractometer MASTER-SUR/NM, Atago Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Thirst perception was measured using pen and paper with a 10-cm VAS (46). Percent body mass change in HYPO was calculated from the EUH body mass within the same menstrual phase.

Psychological variables.
Depressive symptomatology was assessed using the CES-D (47). Given the 1-wk response timeframe of the CES-D, it was only administered once in each menstrual phase during the EUH trial.

Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software for Windows (IBM SPSS Statistics 20, NY). Descriptive values are reported as means (SD), unless otherwise stated. Data were assessed to ensure they were normally distributed and for sphericity, with no corrections needed. Data for Sosm, plasma copeptin, USG, body mass, 17?-estradiol, progesterone, and the P4:E2 ratio were assessed using a two-way (Phase × Hydration) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). For thirst ratings, pain tolerance and pain intensity, and unpleasantness ratings, the data were analyzed by three-way (Phase × Hydration × Water) repeated-measures ANOVA. When main or interaction effects occurred for the two- or three-way ANOVA, post hoc pair-wise analyses were conducted using paired-samples t tests with Bonferroni correction, where appropriate. Data for CES-D and percent body mass change were analyzed using a paired-samples t test to compare means between menstrual phases. Bivariate Pearsons correlations were performed to examine the direction and strength of relationships between the main independent (i.e., hydration markers and ovarian hormone concentrations) and dependent (i.e., ischemic pain measures) variables measured at baseline (i.e., before water ingestion). All pairwise data were included in the correlation analyses to maximize statistical power. Effect sizes are reported as partial eta-squared (?2p
) with demarcations of small (<0.06), medium (>0.06 and <0.14), and large (>0.14) effects, respectively (48). An a priori alpha of ? = 0.05 was used to demarcate statistically significant effects.

RESULTS
Following analysis of ovarian hormone concentrations, three participants did not meet the progesterone threshold of >5 ng·mL?1 and were excluded from subsequent analyses. Therefore, the following results are reported for the remaining 14 participants.

Self-Reported Sleep Duration and Depressive Symptomatology
Mean sleep duration across trials was 7.4 (1.6) h, which was not different between hydration conditions or menstrual phases (all P ? 0.15, ?2p
 ? 0.15). Incomplete data were collected for CES-D scores (n = 13). CES-D scores were not different between menstrual phases [EF: 10 (7) vs. ML: 12 (6); P = 0.55, ?2p
?=?0.03].

Ovarian Hormone Concentrations
Because of the difficulty in obtaining blood samples in one or more trials for three participants, incomplete data were obtained for serum 17?-estradiol and progesterone concentrations (n = 11 each). Both progesterone [by 25.8 (25.9) vs. 0.5 (0.2) ng·mL?1; P = 0.009, ?2p
?=?0.51] and 17?-estradiol [by 106 (58) vs. 52 (27) pg·mL?1; P = 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.66] concentrations were higher in the ML compared with EF phase but were not dependent on hydration status (Phase × Hydration: all P ? 0.46; ?2p
 ? 0.06) (Table 1). Accordingly, the P4:E2 ratio was also higher in the ML compared with EF phase (P = 0.005, ?2p
?=?0.57) independent of hydration status (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.78; ?2p
?=?0.01). Progesterone, 17?-estradiol, and the P4:E2 ratio were all unaffected by hydration status (all P ? 0.46, ?2p
 ? 0.06).

Hydration Status
Biochemical markers of hydration status obtained at baseline (i.e., before water ingestion) indicate that 24 h of fluid restriction was successful in eliciting mild dehydration (Table 2). Absolute body mass was lower in HYPO than in EUH (P = 0.006, ?2p
?=?0.45) but this was not dependent on menstrual phase (Phase × hydration: P = 0.31, ?2p
?=?0.08). Therefore, average percent change in body mass from EUH to HYPO was 0.9% (1.3).

Because of the difficulty in obtaining blood samples, incomplete data were collected for Sosm (n = 10) and plasma copeptin (n = 9). Sosm was higher during HYPO than EUH (P = 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.72) and was higher in EF than in ML (P = 0.03, ?2p
?=?0.43), but these effects were not dependent on menstrual phase or hydration status, respectively (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.22, ?2p
?=?0.17). Both plasma copeptin (P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.44) and USG (P < 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.84) were also higher in HYPO than in EUH, but these were not dependent on menstrual phase (Phase × hydration: both P ? 0.40, ?2p
 ? 0.09). In accordance with the significantly higher values of these biochemical markers, baseline thirst ratings were also higher during HYPO than in EUH (P < 0.001; ?2p
?=?0.89), independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.67, ?2p
?=?0.02).

Thirst Perception Ratings
Incomplete data were collected for thirst perception ratings (n = 13). Overall, thirst was higher during HYPO than EUH [by 3.2 (1.2) cm; P < 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.89] and was higher in ML than in EF [by 0.4 (0.6) cm; P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.30], but these effects were not dependent on menstrual phase or hydration status, respectively (Phase × hydration: P = 0.67, ?2p
?=?0.02). Thirst ratings decreased after water ingestion (from baseline) by a larger extent during HYPO than in EUH [? 4.0 (2.3) vs. ? 0.6 (1.4) cm; Hydration × Water: P < 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.65], independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration × Water: P = 0.47, ?
2
p
?=?0.05).
Ischemic Pain Tolerance
One participant was able to tolerate the ischemic pain for the maximum time limit of 20 min (1,200 s) in one trial (EUH trial in the ML phase) (Fig. 1). Her pain tolerance in this trial was therefore recorded as 1,200 s. Pain tolerance was lower during HYPO than in EUH [by 34 (46) s; P = 0.02, ?2p
?=?0.37), independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.15, ?2p
?=?0.15) or acute water ingestion (Hydration × Water: P = 0.92; ?2p
?=?0.001). Pain tolerance was unaffected by menstrual phase or acute water ingestion (both P ? 0.43, ?2p
 ? 0.05).

Ischemic Pain Intensity and Unpleasantness Ratings
Incomplete data were collected for pain intensity (Fig. 2) and unpleasantness (Fig. 3) at 1 min after handgrip exercise (n = 12 each) because two participants had terminated the pain test before this time point. Both pain intensity [6.6 (1.3) vs. 5.9 (1.4) cm; P = 0.004, ?2p
?=?0.55)] and pain unpleasantness [7.1 (1.3) vs. 6.4 (1.5) cm; P = 0.02, ?2p
?=?0.40] ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise were higher during HYPO than in EUH, independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration: both P ? 0.15, ?2p
 ? 0.18). Both pain intensity (P = 0.004, ?2p
?=?0.54) and pain unpleasantness (P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.34) ratings increased after water ingestion (from baseline), independently of hydration status (Hydration × Water: both P ? 0.50, ?2p
 ? 0.04) or menstrual phase (Phase × Water: both P ? 0.53, ?2p
 ? 0.04).

At pain tolerance, however, both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness ratings were not different between hydration conditions or menstrual phases (all P ? 0.13, ?2p
 ? 0.17). After water ingestion, pain intensity ratings increased by 3.4 (0.6) cm from baseline (P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.29) but pain unpleasantness was unaffected [+0.2 (4.6) cm; P = 0.10, ?2p
?=?0.20], independent of hydration status (Hydration × Water: both P ? 0.11, ?2p
 ? 0.19) or menstrual phase (Phase × Water: both P ? 0.55, ?2p
 ? 0.03).

Correlations
Serum concentrations of 17?-estradiol were negatively correlated with pain tolerance (r = ?0.31, P = 0.02) and positively correlated with pain unpleasantness ratings (r = 0.34, P = 0.02), but were not significantly associated with pain intensity ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (r = 0.23, P = 0.13). However, it should be noted that the strength of the significant correlations observed was weak (48) and therefore should be interpreted with caution. Neither progesterone nor the P4:E2 ratio was significantly associated with any of the ischemic pain measures (all r ? ?0.20, P ? 0.17). Similarly, no significant correlations were found between any of the hydration variables and ischemic pain measures (all r ? 0.20 and P ? 0.17).

DISCUSSION
This study examined the independent and combined effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in healthy eumenorrheic women, and the potential efficacy of acute water ingestion as a remedy to the deleterious impact of hypohydration. The main findings were that: 1) mild hypohydration increased pain sensitivity, 2) menstrual phase did not affect pain sensitivity, nor did it influence the effect of hypohydration on pain, and 3) acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity.

Hypohydration and Pain in Women
Independent of menstrual phase, mild hypohydration following 24 h of fluid restriction reduced pain tolerance (?8%) and increased pain intensity (+13%) and pain unpleasantness (+12%) ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (hereafter referred to as pain ratings) during ischemic pain stimulation, when compared with euhydration. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies that showed negative effects of mild hypohydration on experimental pain sensitivity in men (7, 8). Ogino et al. (7) observed a decrease in pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) following a combination of exercise-induced dehydration and fluid restriction, whereas Bear et al. (8) found an increase in pain intensity ratings but no difference in pain thresholds after 24 h of fluid restriction. Therefore, the current findings extend these previous results to women by showing that mild hypohydration also increases experimental pain sensitivity in women. The previous studies also did not include pain measures that reflect the affective/emotional experience of pain (i.e., pain tolerance or pain unpleasantness ratings) that may be important for chronic pain, whereas both pain threshold and pain intensity ratings assess the sensory/discriminative aspect of pain (49, 50). Although Bear et al. (8) measured pain tolerance, the nature of the stimulus-response relationship for the cold pressor taski.e., plateau and gradual decline in the perceived intensity of the pain stimulus (41)resulted in a large proportion (?2/3) of participants who were able to tolerate the pain until the 4-min cut-off time, thereby precluding meaningful analyses of the results. This issue was not apparent with the ischemic pain test used in the present study, as there was only one instance where the 20-min time limit was reached. Therefore, the current findings further add to the previous data by showing that mild hypohydration also negatively impacts the affective/emotional aspect of pain, as evidenced by the decrease in pain tolerance and increase in pain unpleasantness ratings compared with EUH.

The exact mechanisms underlying the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration cannot be determined from the current data. However, one potential mechanism through which hypohydration may increase pain sensitivity is thirst perception. Geuter et al. (51) showed that an increase in thirst perceptioninduced by consumption of salty snacks followed by 5 h of fluid deprivationled to an increase in pain intensity ratings during noxious heat stimulation, whereas subsequent ad libitum fluid intake, which reduced thirst perception, decreased pain ratings. In another study, stimulation of thirst sensation via hypertonic saline infusion increased pain intensity ratings during noxious pressure stimulation, which were associated with stronger activation of pain-related brain regions; namely, the anterior cingulate cortex and insula (52). Similar findings were reported in the study by Ogino et al. (7). These brain regions were previously shown to be activated and deactivated independently by an increase and decrease in thirst perception, respectively (5254). However, it is not apparent from these data whether the increased pain sensitivity and pain-related brain activity were due to thirst perception per se, physiological hypohydration, or both.

Menstrual Phase and Experimental Pain Sensitivity
Menstrual phase did not modulate the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration, nor did it independently affect pain sensitivity. The lack of a menstrual phase effect on ischemic pain sensitivity is consistent with the findings of most previous studies that examined ischemic pain responses across the menstrual cycle (18, 5558). In contrast, studies by Fillingim et al. (59) and Pfleeger et al. (60) observed greater pain sensitivity during the luteal compared with follicular phase. However, concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone were not measured in the study by Pfleeger et al. (60), whereas the specific definition of the luteal phase used by Fillingim et al. (59) differed from that in the current study. We examined the ML phase when concentrations of both 17?-estradiol and progesterone are elevated, whereas Fillingim et al. (59) included the late-luteal period in their classification of the luteal phase, during which concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone are declining rapidly and are less stable compared with the ML phase. Given that menstrual phases characterized by fluctuating or unstable 17?-estradiol levels have been associated with increased severity of various chronic pain conditions (14), this may explain why Fillingim et al. (59) observed phase differences in pain sensitivity whereas we did not.

The equivocal and inconclusive results regarding menstrual phase effects on experimental pain sensitivity are thought to be due, in part, to the lack of proper verification of menstrual phases through blood measurements of 17?-estradiol and progesterone (15, 16), making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relationship between menstrual phase/hormone status and pain sensitivity. Similar to previous observations (22, 23), Sosm was lower in the ML than EF phase (Table 2); however, this phase difference in hydration did not appear to impact any of the ischemic pain measures (Figs. 13). In this study, we showed that after hydration status was controlled, menstrual phases were properly verified and potential confounders (e.g., dietary and lifestyle factors and dysmenorrhea) were minimized, there was no difference in ischemic pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases. As such, our data suggest that the hormonal fluctuations within the menstrual cycle do not greatly impact pain sensitivity.

Interestingly, although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phase, there was a positive correlation between 17?-estradiol and pain sensitivity, suggesting that women with higher baseline levels of 17?-estradiol may be more sensitive to pain than those with lower 17?-estradiol levels (i.e., between-subject effect). However, given the weak strength of the correlation (r = ?0.32) (48), this finding should be interpreted with caution.

Effects of Acute Water Ingestion
Given that thirst perception may be a potential mechanism linking hypohydration and increased pain sensitivity, we hypothesized that acute water ingestion when hypohydrated would reduce pain sensitivity. This would also help to delineate the effects of thirst and hypohydration per se, on pain, since acute water ingestion would be expected to reduce thirst without altering hydration status (38, 61). However, contrary to our hypothesis, ischemic pain tolerance was not affected by ingestion of 5 mL·kg?1 of water, despite the significant decrease in thirst perception ratings. Meanwhile, ratings of both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness increased, which may appear counterintuitive as participants reported feeling more pain despite being less thirsty. These unexpected findings may be explained by carryover (sensitization) effects from the baseline pain test. A previous study showed that repeated pain stimulation within a single session produced a sensitization effect, whereby pain ratings increased gradually with each repeated stimulation (62). Therefore, this sensitization effect may have masked potential positive effects of acute water ingestion on pain. Future studies that either utilize a longer interval between the repeated pain tests, or perform the postwater ingestion pain test on a separate day, are required to gain further understanding on the relative importance of thirst perception and physiological hypohydration on pain.

Considerations
There are several considerations and limitations of this study that should be noted in addition to those already discussed earlier. First, only healthy, eumenorrheic women were included in this study, which ignores postmenopausal women and oral contraceptive pill users, who have different hormonal profiles compared with eumenorrheic women. Therefore, it is possible that hypohydration may affect pain sensitivity differently in these women compared with eumenorrheic women. Second, blood samples were not obtained after water ingestion to confirm that hydration status was not altered. However, previous data indicate that consuming a moderate volume of water, similar to that in the current study, does not acutely alter hydration status in hypohydrated men (38, 61). In addition, the relatively short interval of 30 min between water ingestion and the subsequent pain test was likely insufficient for hydration status to be altered, because a previous study showed that at least 75 min is required for 300 mL of water to be completely absorbed into the bloodstream (63). Third, as participants could not be blinded to the hydration intervention, the increased pain sensitivity observed during HYPO may have been confounded by nocebo effects (64, 65). Although participants were not aware of the study hypotheses, they were aware of the aims of the study, one of which was to investigate the effects of hypohydration on pain sensitivity. Given the negative connotations of hypohydration or dehydration, it is conceivable that participants would expect hypohydration to increase pain sensitivity, which may have subsequently influenced participants actual responses to the ischemic pain test. Fourth, the body mass change values in HYPO may not accurately reflect the fluid losses induced by the 24 h of fluid restriction. Due to the scheduling constraints that included two experimental visits within 3 days per menstrual phase, we were unable to obtain a baseline body mass at the start of the hydration intervention; thus, body mass change in HYPO was calculated using EUH body mass. As the EUH and HYPO trials within each menstrual phase were separated by at least 48 h, it is likely that the values were confounded by factors other than the change in body water content (e.g., urine and fecal losses, food and fluid consumption). Acknowledging this limitation, we obtained other measures of hydration status (i.e., Sosm, USG, copeptin, and thirst ratings) in addition to body mass change for a more accurate assessment of hydrations status. Finally, our sample size may have limited our ability to detect statistically significant menstrual phase effects on pain. As such, the effects of menstrual phase on pain require further investigation. Our study could provide a reference for future studies with a similar design to base their sample size calculations on. Nevertheless, large effect sizes (?2p
 = 0.370.55) were obtained for the main effect of hypohydration on pain, with an observed power of 0.70.9, which suggests a low probability of false negatives.

Perspectives and Significance
Our data indicate that hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women and this effect may not be reversed immediately by water ingestion. Whereas, menstrual phase (EF vs. ML) does not appear to affect pain sensitivity. These findings suggest that insufficient water intake throughout the day may exacerbate pain perception in healthy women. Given the high prevalence of hypohydration among the general population (25), future studies should investigate whether hypohydration may worsen chronic pain conditions, and the potential efficacy of maintaining adequate hydration in alleviating pain symptoms. This may be especially important for older adults, who are more likely to be hypohydrated and experience chronic pain (25, 66). For human pain researchers, controlling or measuring hydration status of participants may be important to minimize confound, as clinically and physiologically relevant tests such as the cold pressor are affected (67). Although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases after controlling for hydration status, more high-quality research is required to accurately determine whether menstrual phase does or does not affect pain sensitivity. Therefore, until a consensus on the topic has been reached, our data do not discount the need for future pain researchers to verify menstrual phase.","1.

Hypohydration, or mild dehydration, has been found to increase pain sensitivity in women, according to a recent study. The research involved healthy, eumenorrheic women and found that after 24 hours of fluid restriction, pain tolerance decreased and pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings increased during an ischemic pain test. The study also showed that acute water ingestion did not reverse the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration. 

These findings are significant because they suggest that inadequate water intake throughout the day may worsen pain perception in women. Given the high prevalence of hypohydration in the general population, further research is needed to explore the impact of hypohydration on chronic pain conditions and the potential benefits of maintaining proper hydration in alleviating pain symptoms. 

The research participants were healthy, eumenorrheic women with regular menstrual cycles and no history of medical, psychiatric, pain-related, or menstrual-related disorders. They were between the ages of 18 and 50 and engaged in at least 150 minutes of structured exercise per week.

This study highlights the importance of staying hydrated for pain management, especially for women who are more prone to certain chronic pain conditions. Proper hydration may play a role in reducing pain sensitivity and improving pain treatment efficacy."

INTRODUCTION
Pain is recognized as a public health problem (1). Chronic pain [i.e., pain that persists for ?3 mo (2)] in particular, affects ?20% of the global population (3, 4), with negative consequences to the individual, society, healthcare, and the economy. In the United States, the annual cost of chronic pain is estimated to be $635 millionmore than that of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes combined (5). However, chronic pain treatment has proven difficult due to the complex and multifactorial nature of pain (6). In a survey conducted across several European countries, 40% of chronic pain sufferers reported feeling dissatisfied with the effectiveness of their pain treatment(s) (4). Hence, more research on the mechanisms and factors contributing to a persons pain experience is needed. Given the various complexities of studying chronic pain (e.g., ethical, logistical, and medical considerations), such research is usually performed by administering various acute experimental pain stimuli to healthy individuals.

Recent studies have shown that hypohydration can increase experimental pain sensitivity (7, 8). Mild hypohydration of <1% body mass loss, induced by prior fasting and exercise, was found to decrease pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) during a cold pressor task in men, compared with when they were rehydrated (7). These findings were supported in a later study, where subjective ratings of cold pressor pain in men were higher after 24 h of fluid restriction (1.4% body mass loss) than in the euhydrated condition (8). Similarly, a field study showed that hypohydrated cyclists perceived more intense pain in their leg muscles during an ultra-endurance race, compared with the euhydrated cyclists (9). However, these studies were primarily performed in men and the effects of hypohydration on pain in women have not been formally investigated.

Several chronic pain conditions are more prevalent among women than men (10). Women also tend to display greater sensitivity to various experimental pain stimuli (11). Furthermore, pain perception in women may be influenced by hormonal fluctuations (primarily 17?-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle (12, 13). It is generally agreed that the severity of pain symptoms in several chronic pain conditions varies across the menstrual cycle (13, 14); however, whether the menstrual phase affects experimental pain sensitivity in healthy, pain-free women is still contestable (15, 16). The lack of accurate verification of menstrual phases and presence of various potential confounders (e.g., dysmenorrhea, dietary, and lifestyle factors) in many studies could explain the inconsistent findings (15). Some studies have attempted to address these issues (e.g., see Refs. 17 and 18), but such studies are scant and did not appear to impose a progesterone threshold to ensure only ovulatory cycles were included (19). Notably, none of the previous studies measured hydration status of participants at the time of testing, which may be influenced by menstrual phase (20, 21).

The ovarian hormones affect body fluid regulatory mechanisms (22), with potential implications for hydration status (20, 21). The mid-luteal phase (high 17?-estradiol and progesterone) is associated with an earlier release of arginine vasopressin (AVP)a fluid-regulatory hormone that increases renal water retentionand thirst during exercise-induced dehydration or hypertonic saline infusion, compared with the early follicular phase (low 17?-estradiol and progesterone) (23, 24). This may potentially reduce the severity of dehydration for a given hydration challenge in the mid-luteal phase (20, 21). In the context of pain, this may suggest: 1) differences in the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration in the early follicular compared with mid-luteal phase, 2) potential variability in hydration status across the menstrual cycle may have confounded previous research on effects of the menstrual phase and experimental pain sensitivity, and 3) hypohydration may reduce the efficacy of pain treatments in women (21).

Importantly, mild hypohydration appears to be common among women, with data from the United States showing approximately half of the 7,855 surveyed women meeting the hypohydration criterion (plasma tonicity > 295 mmol·L?1) (25). Therefore, the current study investigated the effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in women. We also examined whether the negative consequences of hypohydration on pain could be remedied by acute water ingestion. We hypothesized that 1) hypohydration would increase experimental pain sensitivity in women, 2) the magnitude of this increase in pain sensitivity would differ between the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases, and 3) acute water ingestion would reverse the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration.

METHODS
Ethical Approval
The study was approved by the Massey University Human Ethics Committee: Southern A (18/66). The study conformed to the requirements of the US Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (45 CFR, Part 46), and the standards set by the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki, except for registration in a database. All participants provided written, informed consent before all trials. Researchers were not blinded to the experimental conditions and analyses.

Participants
Twenty-three healthy, eumenorrheic women initially volunteered for this study. As this is the first study, to our knowledge, that has investigated the effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase in combination, there was no reference study to base our sample size calculations on. As such, sample size was estimated from two previous studies; one on hypohydration and pain (? = 0.79 and effect size = 0.53) (8) and the other on a meta-analysis on menstrual phase effects on pain (effect size = 0.5 for ischemic pain, ? = 0.80) (12), which yielded required sample sizes of n = 17 and n = 27, respectively at an ? = 0.05. Therefore, we aimed for 17 > n < 27 and estimated the required number of participants for sufficient power to be n = 22.

Six participants did not proceed with the experimental trials due to scheduling difficulties; thus, 17 women completed all experimental trials [means (SD): age, 28 (8) yr; height, 1.63 (0.07) m; body mass, 65.0 (10.8) kg]. Participants reported having regular menstrual cycles (i.e., 2135 days) at the time of recruitment and had not used hormonal contraceptives within the past 6 mo. All participants were nonsmokers, had no pre-existing or history of medical, psychiatric, pain-related, or menstrual-related disorders (e.g., dysmenorrhea, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and premenstrual syndrome), and were not taking any medications. Taking into consideration these inclusion/exclusion criteria, women aged > 18 < 50 yr were recruited. All participants, except for one, were recreationally physically active, engaging in at least 150 min of structured exercise per week.

Experimental Overview
Participants attended the laboratory on six occasions: two familiarization sessions, followed by four experimental trials. The four experimental trials were a full crossover of menstrual phase (EF and ML) and hydration status [euhydrated (EUH) and hypohydrated (HYPO)] and were performed over one or two menstrual cycles. The order of the experimental trials was randomized and counterbalanced, but the order of EUH and HYPO for each participant was maintained in the different menstrual phases. The experimental trials for each participant began at the same time of day (±1 h) to minimize diurnal variation in pain sensitivity (26) and ovarian hormone concentrations (27). All trials were separated by at least 48 h and were performed under standard environmental conditions (22°C, 50% relative humidity, room illuminance of 600 lx).

Familiarization
Before the experimental trials, participants were familiarized with the ischemic pain test (see Ischemic Pain Test) on two separate occasions to minimize potential learning and anxiety effects. The first familiarization session also included measurement of participants height and body mass (for calculation of fluid volume), and assessment of their maximal handgrip strength (see Maximal Handgrip Strength Assessment) to determine the absolute intensity for the submaximal contractions during the ischemic pain test. The number of familiarization sessions was determined from preliminary assessment of the time course of the learning effects, where pain outcome measures appeared to plateau after two sessions.

Maximal Handgrip Strength Assessment
Using their nondominant hand, participants performed three maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) with a handgrip dynamometer (MLT003 Grip Force Transducer, ADInstruments Inc., CO) (28). Participants were asked to squeeze the dynamometer maximally for 5 s during each MVC, separated by 1 min of rest. Force output from the dynamometer was recorded (PowerLab, ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand) and displayed in real-time (LabChart Pro, ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand). Maximal handgrip strength was determined by calculating the mean of the peak values for the three MVCs. This assessment was only conducted once during the first familiarization session, rather than at the start of each experimental trial, to prevent potential effects of the MVCs on subsequent pain sensitivity (28). Furthermore, maximal handgrip strength does not appear to be affected by menstrual phase (19, 29) or hypohydration (30, 31).

Dietary and Lifestyle Control
Participants refrained from pain-relieving medications, alcohol, and strenuous exercise at least 12 h before the start of each experimental trial. Participants also maintained their habitual caffeine intake over this 24-h period to minimize confounding effects of caffeine on pain sensitivity (32) and psychological variables (33, 34). To prevent caffeine withdrawal during the hypohydrated trials, participants who normally consumed caffeinated beverages were given a caffeine tablet (No-Doz Awakeners, Novartis Consumer Health, Inc.) to take in place of the beverages. Participants recorded their diet, physical activity, and time to bed and wake (i.e., sleep duration) during the 24-h period before their first trial and were asked to replicate these for subsequent trials. Participants completed a dietary and lifestyle record sheet at the start of each trial to assess adherence to these instructions.

Menstrual Cycle Phase and Hydration Intervention
Participants were tested during the EF and ML phases of their menstrual cycle to maximize the phase difference in ovarian hormone concentrations. The EF trials took place on days 4 (1) and 6 (2) and the ML trials on days 20 (2) and 22 (2), with day 1 representing start of menses and assuming a conventional 28-day menstrual cycle. Testing was scheduled using the three-step method (35) whereby self-reported menses onset and urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) testing (EasyCheck Ovulation Test, Phoenix Medcare, Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand) prospectively identified EF and ML, whereas measurement of serum 17?-estradiol and progesterone retrospectively confirmed ML. The EF phase was further verified by 17?-estradiol concentrations that were lower than in ML. Participants started daily LH testing 16 days before the end of a typical cycle until a positive LH test result was obtained (confirmed visually by the researchers), with ML trials then scheduled six to ten days after the positive LH test. To ensure ovulation had occurred and to minimize the likelihood of including anovulatory or luteal phase-deficient cycles, participants with progesterone < 5 ng·mL?1 were excluded from the final analyses (19, 36).

Twenty-four hours before each trial, participants were instructed to either restrict fluid intake and avoid consumption of high-water content foods (>50%, e.g., soups, vegetables, and fruits) (HYPO), or to drink ad libitum (EUH). Participants recorded their food and fluid intake over this 24-h period retrospectively at the start of each trial (see Dietary and Lifestyle Control and Experimental Protocol).

Experimental Protocol
Upon the participants arrival at the laboratory, a blood sample was obtained from the antecubital vein of the dominant arm via venepuncture. Participants then provided a urine sample and had their body mass measured. Urine specific gravity (USG) was measured immediately to confirm euhydration (USG < 1.020) or hypohydration (USG ? 1.020) (37). Participants then completed the dietary and lifestyle record sheet, Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (EUH only; see Measurements) and thirst ratings, followed by the ischemic pain test.

Immediately after the pain test, participants ingested a glass of water (5 mL·kg?1 of body mass measured during the first familiarization) and finished it within 5 min. This volume of water was previously shown to produce an immediate decrease in thirst perception in hypohydrated men (38). A 30-min break followed, during which participants remained in the laboratory and performed their activity of choice (e.g., reading and watching videos) that was consistent for all trials. After the break, participants repeated the thirst ratings and ischemic pain test. The duration of the break was determined based on previous data that examined the reliability of pressure pain measurements taken before and after 30 min of rest (39). Pain thresholds at both time points were not different; however, pain ratings decreased after the 30-min break in women, but not in men. Although this suggests that more than 30 min may be required to ameliorate carryover effects, especially in women, we decided on 30 min to prevent boredom and restlessness since participants had to remain in the laboratory during this period.

Ischemic Pain Test
The ischemic pain test consisted of the Submaximal Effort Tourniquet Procedure (40). This experimental pain stimulus was chosen as it is more clinically relevant than other pain stimuli (e.g., noxious heat, mechanical pressure, and electrical stimulation) (41). A pneumatic cuff was positioned on the participants nondominant arm, just above the elbow joint. The participants arm was passively raised to a vertical position for 30 s to promote venous drainage. The pneumatic cuff was then inflated to 250 mmHg and a stopwatch was started. The participants arm was immediately lowered to a horizontal position on the table, such that the forearm rests on the table with the elbow joint at a 90° angle. To promote forearm ischemia, participants performed 25 handgrip exercises at 30% of their predetermined maximum handgrip strength (see Familiarization). Each contraction was sustained for 2 s and followed by 2 s of rest. Auditory signals indicated the start and end of each contraction. Participants received continuous visual feedback of their force output and the target force on a laptop screen.

Upon completion of the handgrip exercises, the cuff remained inflated on the participants arm and participants watched a nature documentary to standardize their attention throughout the remainder of the pain test. The volume of the video was maintained at 30% for all trials. One minute after the end of the handgrip exercises, participants rated their pain intensity and unpleasantness on a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) (42). Participants were asked to indicate verbally when they were no longer able or willing to endure the pain (pain tolerance). The stopwatch was then stopped; just before the cuff was deflated, participants rated their pain intensity and unpleasantness again, to verify that they had reached pain tolerance. Unknown to participants, a maximum time limit of 20 min was enforced for the pain test.

Measurements
Anthropometric.
Participants height and body mass were measured using a stadiometer (Seca, Hamburg, Germany; accurate to 0.1 cm) and electronic scale (Model X3M, HIWEIGH Technologies Limited, Shanghai, China; accurate to 10 g), respectively.

Ovarian hormone concentrations.
Venous blood was collected into two 10 mL vacutainer tubes (Becton-Dickson, Oxford, UK). One tube contained clot activator for analysis of serum osmolality (Sosm), 17?-estradiol, and progesterone concentrations, whereas the other tube contained K3EDTA for analysis of plasma copeptin. The tube containing clot activator was inverted gently and left to clot for a minimum of 30 min at room temperature. The whole blood in both tubes was then centrifuged (Centrifuge 5804 R, Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) at 4°C and 260 g for 15 min to separate serum and plasma from whole blood. Aliquots of serum and plasma were then separated into three Eppendorf tubes (Genuine Axygen Quality) each and stored at ?80°C for further analysis. Commercially available enzyme-linked immune assays were used to measure concentrations of 17?-estradiol (Demeditec Diagnostics, Kiel, Germany) and progesterone (IBL International, Hamburg, Germany) in serum samples, with a sensitivity of 6.2 pg·mL?1 and 0.045 ng·mL?1, respectively, and an intra-assay variation of <6% and <7%, respectively. The ratio of progesterone to 17?-estradiol (P4:E2 ratio) was then calculated (43).

Hydration status.
Hydration status was assessed by measurement of Sosm, plasma copeptin concentrations, USG, ratings of thirst perception, and percent body mass change. Serum osmolality was measured via freezing-point depression (Digimatic osmometer Model 3D2, Advanced Instruments, Inc., Norwood, MA). Measurements were made in duplicate and averaged. If the two measurements differed by more than 5%, a third measurement was taken and the average of the two closest values was calculated. Plasma copeptin concentrations, a surrogate marker for AVP (44, 45), were measured with an automated immunofluorescent Copeptin proAVP KRYPTOR assay (B·R·A·H·M·S KRYPTOR compact PLUS analyzer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Henningsdorf, Germany), with a sensitivity of 1.08 pmol·L?1. Urine specific gravity was measured using a handheld clinical refractometer (Clinical Refractometer MASTER-SUR/NM, Atago Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Thirst perception was measured using pen and paper with a 10-cm VAS (46). Percent body mass change in HYPO was calculated from the EUH body mass within the same menstrual phase.

Psychological variables.
Depressive symptomatology was assessed using the CES-D (47). Given the 1-wk response timeframe of the CES-D, it was only administered once in each menstrual phase during the EUH trial.

Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software for Windows (IBM SPSS Statistics 20, NY). Descriptive values are reported as means (SD), unless otherwise stated. Data were assessed to ensure they were normally distributed and for sphericity, with no corrections needed. Data for Sosm, plasma copeptin, USG, body mass, 17?-estradiol, progesterone, and the P4:E2 ratio were assessed using a two-way (Phase × Hydration) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). For thirst ratings, pain tolerance and pain intensity, and unpleasantness ratings, the data were analyzed by three-way (Phase × Hydration × Water) repeated-measures ANOVA. When main or interaction effects occurred for the two- or three-way ANOVA, post hoc pair-wise analyses were conducted using paired-samples t tests with Bonferroni correction, where appropriate. Data for CES-D and percent body mass change were analyzed using a paired-samples t test to compare means between menstrual phases. Bivariate Pearsons correlations were performed to examine the direction and strength of relationships between the main independent (i.e., hydration markers and ovarian hormone concentrations) and dependent (i.e., ischemic pain measures) variables measured at baseline (i.e., before water ingestion). All pairwise data were included in the correlation analyses to maximize statistical power. Effect sizes are reported as partial eta-squared (?2p
) with demarcations of small (<0.06), medium (>0.06 and <0.14), and large (>0.14) effects, respectively (48). An a priori alpha of ? = 0.05 was used to demarcate statistically significant effects.

RESULTS
Following analysis of ovarian hormone concentrations, three participants did not meet the progesterone threshold of >5 ng·mL?1 and were excluded from subsequent analyses. Therefore, the following results are reported for the remaining 14 participants.

Self-Reported Sleep Duration and Depressive Symptomatology
Mean sleep duration across trials was 7.4 (1.6) h, which was not different between hydration conditions or menstrual phases (all P ? 0.15, ?2p
 ? 0.15). Incomplete data were collected for CES-D scores (n = 13). CES-D scores were not different between menstrual phases [EF: 10 (7) vs. ML: 12 (6); P = 0.55, ?2p
?=?0.03].

Ovarian Hormone Concentrations
Because of the difficulty in obtaining blood samples in one or more trials for three participants, incomplete data were obtained for serum 17?-estradiol and progesterone concentrations (n = 11 each). Both progesterone [by 25.8 (25.9) vs. 0.5 (0.2) ng·mL?1; P = 0.009, ?2p
?=?0.51] and 17?-estradiol [by 106 (58) vs. 52 (27) pg·mL?1; P = 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.66] concentrations were higher in the ML compared with EF phase but were not dependent on hydration status (Phase × Hydration: all P ? 0.46; ?2p
 ? 0.06) (Table 1). Accordingly, the P4:E2 ratio was also higher in the ML compared with EF phase (P = 0.005, ?2p
?=?0.57) independent of hydration status (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.78; ?2p
?=?0.01). Progesterone, 17?-estradiol, and the P4:E2 ratio were all unaffected by hydration status (all P ? 0.46, ?2p
 ? 0.06).

Hydration Status
Biochemical markers of hydration status obtained at baseline (i.e., before water ingestion) indicate that 24 h of fluid restriction was successful in eliciting mild dehydration (Table 2). Absolute body mass was lower in HYPO than in EUH (P = 0.006, ?2p
?=?0.45) but this was not dependent on menstrual phase (Phase × hydration: P = 0.31, ?2p
?=?0.08). Therefore, average percent change in body mass from EUH to HYPO was 0.9% (1.3).

Because of the difficulty in obtaining blood samples, incomplete data were collected for Sosm (n = 10) and plasma copeptin (n = 9). Sosm was higher during HYPO than EUH (P = 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.72) and was higher in EF than in ML (P = 0.03, ?2p
?=?0.43), but these effects were not dependent on menstrual phase or hydration status, respectively (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.22, ?2p
?=?0.17). Both plasma copeptin (P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.44) and USG (P < 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.84) were also higher in HYPO than in EUH, but these were not dependent on menstrual phase (Phase × hydration: both P ? 0.40, ?2p
 ? 0.09). In accordance with the significantly higher values of these biochemical markers, baseline thirst ratings were also higher during HYPO than in EUH (P < 0.001; ?2p
?=?0.89), independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.67, ?2p
?=?0.02).

Thirst Perception Ratings
Incomplete data were collected for thirst perception ratings (n = 13). Overall, thirst was higher during HYPO than EUH [by 3.2 (1.2) cm; P < 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.89] and was higher in ML than in EF [by 0.4 (0.6) cm; P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.30], but these effects were not dependent on menstrual phase or hydration status, respectively (Phase × hydration: P = 0.67, ?2p
?=?0.02). Thirst ratings decreased after water ingestion (from baseline) by a larger extent during HYPO than in EUH [? 4.0 (2.3) vs. ? 0.6 (1.4) cm; Hydration × Water: P < 0.001, ?2p
?=?0.65], independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration × Water: P = 0.47, ?
2
p
?=?0.05).
Ischemic Pain Tolerance
One participant was able to tolerate the ischemic pain for the maximum time limit of 20 min (1,200 s) in one trial (EUH trial in the ML phase) (Fig. 1). Her pain tolerance in this trial was therefore recorded as 1,200 s. Pain tolerance was lower during HYPO than in EUH [by 34 (46) s; P = 0.02, ?2p
?=?0.37), independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration: P = 0.15, ?2p
?=?0.15) or acute water ingestion (Hydration × Water: P = 0.92; ?2p
?=?0.001). Pain tolerance was unaffected by menstrual phase or acute water ingestion (both P ? 0.43, ?2p
 ? 0.05).

Ischemic Pain Intensity and Unpleasantness Ratings
Incomplete data were collected for pain intensity (Fig. 2) and unpleasantness (Fig. 3) at 1 min after handgrip exercise (n = 12 each) because two participants had terminated the pain test before this time point. Both pain intensity [6.6 (1.3) vs. 5.9 (1.4) cm; P = 0.004, ?2p
?=?0.55)] and pain unpleasantness [7.1 (1.3) vs. 6.4 (1.5) cm; P = 0.02, ?2p
?=?0.40] ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise were higher during HYPO than in EUH, independent of menstrual phase (Phase × Hydration: both P ? 0.15, ?2p
 ? 0.18). Both pain intensity (P = 0.004, ?2p
?=?0.54) and pain unpleasantness (P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.34) ratings increased after water ingestion (from baseline), independently of hydration status (Hydration × Water: both P ? 0.50, ?2p
 ? 0.04) or menstrual phase (Phase × Water: both P ? 0.53, ?2p
 ? 0.04).

At pain tolerance, however, both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness ratings were not different between hydration conditions or menstrual phases (all P ? 0.13, ?2p
 ? 0.17). After water ingestion, pain intensity ratings increased by 3.4 (0.6) cm from baseline (P = 0.04, ?2p
?=?0.29) but pain unpleasantness was unaffected [+0.2 (4.6) cm; P = 0.10, ?2p
?=?0.20], independent of hydration status (Hydration × Water: both P ? 0.11, ?2p
 ? 0.19) or menstrual phase (Phase × Water: both P ? 0.55, ?2p
 ? 0.03).

Serum concentrations of 17?-estradiol were negatively correlated with pain tolerance (r = ?0.31, P = 0.02) and positively correlated with pain unpleasantness ratings (r = 0.34, P = 0.02), but were not significantly associated with pain intensity ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (r = 0.23, P = 0.13). However, it should be noted that the strength of the significant correlations observed was weak (48) and therefore should be interpreted with caution. Neither progesterone nor the P4:E2 ratio was significantly associated with any of the ischemic pain measures (all r ? ?0.20, P ? 0.17). Similarly, no significant correlations were found between any of the hydration variables and ischemic pain measures (all r ? 0.20 and P ? 0.17).

DISCUSSION
This study examined the independent and combined effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in healthy eumenorrheic women, and the potential efficacy of acute water ingestion as a remedy to the deleterious impact of hypohydration. The main findings were that: 1) mild hypohydration increased pain sensitivity, 2) menstrual phase did not affect pain sensitivity, nor did it influence the effect of hypohydration on pain, and 3) acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity.

Hypohydration and Pain in Women
Independent of menstrual phase, mild hypohydration following 24 h of fluid restriction reduced pain tolerance (?8%) and increased pain intensity (+13%) and pain unpleasantness (+12%) ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (hereafter referred to as pain ratings) during ischemic pain stimulation, when compared with euhydration. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies that showed negative effects of mild hypohydration on experimental pain sensitivity in men (7, 8). Ogino et al. (7) observed a decrease in pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) following a combination of exercise-induced dehydration and fluid restriction, whereas Bear et al. (8) found an increase in pain intensity ratings but no difference in pain thresholds after 24 h of fluid restriction. Therefore, the current findings extend these previous results to women by showing that mild hypohydration also increases experimental pain sensitivity in women. The previous studies also did not include pain measures that reflect the affective/emotional experience of pain (i.e., pain tolerance or pain unpleasantness ratings) that may be important for chronic pain, whereas both pain threshold and pain intensity ratings assess the sensory/discriminative aspect of pain (49, 50). Although Bear et al. (8) measured pain tolerance, the nature of the stimulus-response relationship for the cold pressor taski.e., plateau and gradual decline in the perceived intensity of the pain stimulus (41)resulted in a large proportion (?2/3) of participants who were able to tolerate the pain until the 4-min cut-off time, thereby precluding meaningful analyses of the results. This issue was not apparent with the ischemic pain test used in the present study, as there was only one instance where the 20-min time limit was reached. Therefore, the current findings further add to the previous data by showing that mild hypohydration also negatively impacts the affective/emotional aspect of pain, as evidenced by the decrease in pain tolerance and increase in pain unpleasantness ratings compared with EUH.

The exact mechanisms underlying the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration cannot be determined from the current data. However, one potential mechanism through which hypohydration may increase pain sensitivity is thirst perception. Geuter et al. (51) showed that an increase in thirst perceptioninduced by consumption of salty snacks followed by 5 h of fluid deprivationled to an increase in pain intensity ratings during noxious heat stimulation, whereas subsequent ad libitum fluid intake, which reduced thirst perception, decreased pain ratings. In another study, stimulation of thirst sensation via hypertonic saline infusion increased pain intensity ratings during noxious pressure stimulation, which were associated with stronger activation of pain-related brain regions; namely, the anterior cingulate cortex and insula (52). Similar findings were reported in the study by Ogino et al. (7). These brain regions were previously shown to be activated and deactivated independently by an increase and decrease in thirst perception, respectively (5254). However, it is not apparent from these data whether the increased pain sensitivity and pain-related brain activity were due to thirst perception per se, physiological hypohydration, or both.

Menstrual Phase and Experimental Pain Sensitivity
Menstrual phase did not modulate the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration, nor did it independently affect pain sensitivity. The lack of a menstrual phase effect on ischemic pain sensitivity is consistent with the findings of most previous studies that examined ischemic pain responses across the menstrual cycle (18, 5558). In contrast, studies by Fillingim et al. (59) and Pfleeger et al. (60) observed greater pain sensitivity during the luteal compared with follicular phase. However, concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone were not measured in the study by Pfleeger et al. (60), whereas the specific definition of the luteal phase used by Fillingim et al. (59) differed from that in the current study. We examined the ML phase when concentrations of both 17?-estradiol and progesterone are elevated, whereas Fillingim et al. (59) included the late-luteal period in their classification of the luteal phase, during which concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone are declining rapidly and are less stable compared with the ML phase. Given that menstrual phases characterized by fluctuating or unstable 17?-estradiol levels have been associated with increased severity of various chronic pain conditions (14), this may explain why Fillingim et al. (59) observed phase differences in pain sensitivity whereas we did not.

The equivocal and inconclusive results regarding menstrual phase effects on experimental pain sensitivity are thought to be due, in part, to the lack of proper verification of menstrual phases through blood measurements of 17?-estradiol and progesterone (15, 16), making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relationship between menstrual phase/hormone status and pain sensitivity. Similar to previous observations (22, 23), Sosm was lower in the ML than EF phase (Table 2); however, this phase difference in hydration did not appear to impact any of the ischemic pain measures (Figs. 13). In this study, we showed that after hydration status was controlled, menstrual phases were properly verified and potential confounders (e.g., dietary and lifestyle factors and dysmenorrhea) were minimized, there was no difference in ischemic pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases. As such, our data suggest that the hormonal fluctuations within the menstrual cycle do not greatly impact pain sensitivity.

Interestingly, although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phase, there was a positive correlation between 17?-estradiol and pain sensitivity, suggesting that women with higher baseline levels of 17?-estradiol may be more sensitive to pain than those with lower 17?-estradiol levels (i.e., between-subject effect). However, given the weak strength of the correlation (r = ?0.32) (48), this finding should be interpreted with caution.

Effects of Acute Water Ingestion
Given that thirst perception may be a potential mechanism linking hypohydration and increased pain sensitivity, we hypothesized that acute water ingestion when hypohydrated would reduce pain sensitivity. This would also help to delineate the effects of thirst and hypohydration per se, on pain, since acute water ingestion would be expected to reduce thirst without altering hydration status (38, 61). However, contrary to our hypothesis, ischemic pain tolerance was not affected by ingestion of 5 mL·kg?1 of water, despite the significant decrease in thirst perception ratings. Meanwhile, ratings of both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness increased, which may appear counterintuitive as participants reported feeling more pain despite being less thirsty. These unexpected findings may be explained by carryover (sensitization) effects from the baseline pain test. A previous study showed that repeated pain stimulation within a single session produced a sensitization effect, whereby pain ratings increased gradually with each repeated stimulation (62). Therefore, this sensitization effect may have masked potential positive effects of acute water ingestion on pain. Future studies that either utilize a longer interval between the repeated pain tests, or perform the postwater ingestion pain test on a separate day, are required to gain further understanding on the relative importance of thirst perception and physiological hypohydration on pain.

Considerations
There are several considerations and limitations of this study that should be noted in addition to those already discussed earlier. First, only healthy, eumenorrheic women were included in this study, which ignores postmenopausal women and oral contraceptive pill users, who have different hormonal profiles compared with eumenorrheic women. Therefore, it is possible that hypohydration may affect pain sensitivity differently in these women compared with eumenorrheic women. Second, blood samples were not obtained after water ingestion to confirm that hydration status was not altered. However, previous data indicate that consuming a moderate volume of water, similar to that in the current study, does not acutely alter hydration status in hypohydrated men (38, 61). In addition, the relatively short interval of 30 min between water ingestion and the subsequent pain test was likely insufficient for hydration status to be altered, because a previous study showed that at least 75 min is required for 300 mL of water to be completely absorbed into the bloodstream (63). Third, as participants could not be blinded to the hydration intervention, the increased pain sensitivity observed during HYPO may have been confounded by nocebo effects (64, 65). Although participants were not aware of the study hypotheses, they were aware of the aims of the study, one of which was to investigate the effects of hypohydration on pain sensitivity. Given the negative connotations of hypohydration or dehydration, it is conceivable that participants would expect hypohydration to increase pain sensitivity, which may have subsequently influenced participants actual responses to the ischemic pain test. Fourth, the body mass change values in HYPO may not accurately reflect the fluid losses induced by the 24 h of fluid restriction. Due to the scheduling constraints that included two experimental visits within 3 days per menstrual phase, we were unable to obtain a baseline body mass at the start of the hydration intervention; thus, body mass change in HYPO was calculated using EUH body mass. As the EUH and HYPO trials within each menstrual phase were separated by at least 48 h, it is likely that the values were confounded by factors other than the change in body water content (e.g., urine and fecal losses, food and fluid consumption). Acknowledging this limitation, we obtained other measures of hydration status (i.e., Sosm, USG, copeptin, and thirst ratings) in addition to body mass change for a more accurate assessment of hydrations status. Finally, our sample size may have limited our ability to detect statistically significant menstrual phase effects on pain. As such, the effects of menstrual phase on pain require further investigation. Our study could provide a reference for future studies with a similar design to base their sample size calculations on. Nevertheless, large effect sizes (?2p
 = 0.370.55) were obtained for the main effect of hypohydration on pain, with an observed power of 0.70.9, which suggests a low probability of false negatives.

Perspectives and Significance
Our data indicate that hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women and this effect may not be reversed immediately by water ingestion. Whereas, menstrual phase (EF vs. ML) does not appear to affect pain sensitivity. These findings suggest that insufficient water intake throughout the day may exacerbate pain perception in healthy women. Given the high prevalence of hypohydration among the general population (25), future studies should investigate whether hypohydration may worsen chronic pain conditions, and the potential efficacy of maintaining adequate hydration in alleviating pain symptoms. This may be especially important for older adults, who are more likely to be hypohydrated and experience chronic pain (25, 66). For human pain researchers, controlling or measuring hydration status of participants may be important to minimize confound, as clinically and physiologically relevant tests such as the cold pressor are affected (67). Although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases after controlling for hydration status, more high-quality research is required to accurately determine whether menstrual phase does or does not affect pain sensitivity. Therefore, until a consensus on the topic has been reached, our data do not discount the need for future pain researchers to verify menstrual phase.","1.

This research is relevant to the public because it provides insights into the relationship between hydration and pain perception in women.

INTRODUCTION 
Weight stigma is pervasive. Higher weight individuals are stigmatized across many contexts, including healthcare, employment and income, education, media, and interpersonal relationships [1]. Repeated exposure to weight stigma may be consequential as considerable evidence suggests that weight stigma undermines physical health even when controlling for body mass index (BMI), which addresses the potential confound that higher adiposity begets both weight stigma and poorer health. For instance, weight discrimination predicts physiological dysregulation involving a suite of outcomes (e.g., blood pressure; inflammation; cholesterol) [2], and even mortality [3]. These findings indicate a vulnerable health profile of individuals stigmatized for their weight, particularly those with overweight or obesity. Yet, it remains unclear how weight stigma may also impact several health behaviors, which is one likely pathway through which weight stigma gets under the skin to generate poorer health outcomes. Scholars have previously suggested that weight stigma may play a positive role in motivating individuals to engage in health behaviors that could lead to weight losspresumably as a way to improve health [4]. This contention, however, is not empirically supported. Rather, stigmatizing individuals for their weight is consistently associated with negative consequences [5]. Although health behaviors are modifiable ways to improve health across the weight spectrum, individuals who experience weight stigma may cope with this mistreatment by engaging in health compromising behaviors. For instance, a person who has been stigmatized because of their size may be less likely to go to the gym, as this is an environment that puts them at risk for further stigmatization. Individuals encountering weight stigma may also eat to comfort their distress [6]. Although previous research has shown that, independent of BMI, weight stigma is associated with increased maladaptive eating behaviors and decreased motivation to exercise [7], less is known about other common health behaviors such as alcohol use and sleep. Thus, the present study examined the relationship between weight stigma and several modifiable health behaviors in a large U.S. sample. In the next section, the existing literature on weight stigma is outlined across four different health behaviors: eating behavior, physical activity, alcohol use, and sleep. Where available, findings pertaining to gender differences in these areas of research are summarized. As will become evident below, there are notable gaps in this literature that we address in the present study. 

WEIGHT STIGMA AND EATING BEHAVIOR 

Eating a healthy diet helps prevent noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer [8]. However, weight stigma may pose one barrier to healthy eating behavior. In laboratory settings, stigmatizing individuals with higher weight (or individuals who perceived themselves as such) led to short-term increases in eating of highfat, -sugar, and -calorie foods [9]. This eating is theorized to be a form of comfort eating due to the stress of weight stigma [6] and at least one study has found an association between weight stigma and emotional eating [10]. Weight stigma is also associated with unhealthy weight control behaviors and disordered eating such as binge eating [11]. Additionally, there is some longitudinal evidence that shows the potential long-term effects of weight stigma on adolescents eating and weight control practices. For example, one study found that adolescent girls who were labeled too fat showed increased bulimic and unhealthy weight control behaviors (e.g., using diet pills) 5 years later [12]. 

WEIGHT STIGMA AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 

Engaging in regular physical activity is associated with numerous health benefits, including lower risk for premature all-cause mortality, hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [13]. For higher weight individuals, weight stigma may be a barrier to engage in physical activity, though the findings are mixed. Some studies have shown that weight stigma is associated with greater exercise avoidance [14] and lower exercise selfefficacy and intentions [15]. One study found that weight bias internalization was associated with lower levels of exercise and self-efficacy, while experienced weight stigma predicted higher levels of exercise [16]. Yet other research found a positive relationship between weight discrimination and greater sedentary behavior among middle-aged and older adults [17]. 

WEIGHT STIGMA AND ALCOHOL USE 

Alcohol consumption, particularly heavy drinking, has been associated with heart disease, stroke, and some cancers [18]. There is a large body of research showing that perceived discrimination on the basis of other stigmatized identities is linked to substance use, including alcohol [19] and preliminary evidence suggests that experiencing weight stigma is associated with alcohol dependence [20]. Internalizing anti-fat attitudes may also encourage unhealthy coping mechanisms, as seen with medical students of higher weight who turn to alcohol or drugs [21]. Given the link between psychological distress and alcohol consumption [22], it is also plausible that the distress associated with weight stigma spurs unhealthy alcohol consumption. 

WEIGHT STIGMA AND SLEEP DISTURBANCE 

There is a noticeable lack of research in the weight stigma literature on sleep [23], but there is reason to believe a relationship may exist given research on other stigmatized identities. For example, one systematic review found strong evidence that perceived discrimination is associated with poorer sleep, from both cross-sectional and prospective data [24]. In a large, nationally representative U.S. sample, individuals who experienced more everyday discrimination had worse objective sleep and reported greater sleep difficulties [25]. Another representative study found that perceived racial discrimination in healthcare environments independently predicted sleep disturbance [26]. Individuals with higher weight may likewise experience disturbed sleep given the chronic and pervasive nature of weight stigma. 

WEIGHT STIGMA AND GENDER DIFFERENCES 

A significant portion of weight stigma research has focused on women with higher weight. The dearth of research on men is likely due in part to evidence that women are more likely to experience weight stigma [27]. However, recent findings indicate that weight stigma is prevalent among men as well [28]. Previous research has also shown that not all weight stigma findings related to health behaviors are uniform across genders. For example, one study found that weight teasing by family members was associated with unhealthy weight control behaviors (e.g., skipping meals, fasting) among both males and females, however only females reported extreme weight control behaviors (e.g., using laxatives, vomiting) [29]. Gender differences have also been documented in adolescence as weight-related teasing predicted greater unhealthy weight control behaviors among boys, while girls were more likely to diet [30]. In the domain of physical activity, weight stigma was associated with more vigorous physical activity among higher weight men, but not for women [31]. In sum, there is still much to be determined in the domain of weight stigma and health behaviors. The present study fills a critical gap in the extant literature by examining multiple health behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sleep, alcohol use, eating behavior) at once, across gender and weight status. It was hypothesized that: (1) Greater weight stigma would be associated with poorer health behaviors in the domains of physical activity, sleep disturbance, alcohol use, disordered eating, and comfort eating; (2) Weight status would moderate the association of weight stigma with health behaviors, such that the relationship would be stronger for individuals with higher BMIs and selfperceived weight. Given limited prior research, we made no directional hypotheses regarding gender differences. All a priori hypotheses and confirmatory analyses were preregistered on the Open Science Framework, https://osf.io/ g4wz9?view_only=d0fafe6d7cc24846b1b1cd6b59a3783e.

METHODS 

Participants The UCLA North General Institutional Review Board approved the present study. Participants (N = 2022) in the United States were recruited for the Eating in America Study through a panel on the online survey platform, Qualtrics, between December 2019 and January 2020. Individuals who were English speaking and at least 18 years of age were eligible to participate. Individuals were census matched according to national quotas for age, self-reported gender, income, race/ethnicity, and census region in the U. S. Eligible participants reviewed an online information sheet and gave their consent to participate. Several steps were taken to obtain the final analytic sample in this cross-sectional study. First, a random sample (n = 500) was removed from the full dataset (N = 2022) to conduct exploratory analyses; the final exploratory sample was comprised of 438 participants after exclusion criteria were applied. Then, participants were removed from the full dataset if they met at least one of the following exclusion criteria: failed attention checks (n = 202), biologically implausible height (90 inches; n = 25), weight (1000 lb; n = 29), or BMI values (70; n = 65) [32]. This yielded a sample size of 1759 after removing 263 individuals. Finally, any individuals from the exploratory sample who had not already been excluded were removed to obtain the final sample (N = 1327 participants). The exploratory sample was not included in the confirmatory analyses. Measures Participants completed a series of self-report measures, including assessments of daily experiences with anticipated weight stigma and weight-based discrimination, physical activity, sleep disturbance, alcohol use, disordered eating, comfort eating, demographic questions, and anthropometric measurements. Weight stigma Weight stigma was assessed using a 2-item composite measure of daily anticipated and experienced weight stigma (see validation work in Online Supplementary Materials 4). Individuals indicated the frequency of anticipating weight stigma (In your day-to-day life, how often are you concerned about or worried you will be negatively stereotyped or mistreated because of your weight?) and experiencing weight stigma (In your day-to-day life, how often are you treated with less respect, harassed, or discriminated against because of your weight?) on a 4-point response scale from (Not at allOften). A mean score was computed (? = 0.86). Physical activity Physical activity was measured with the validated [33], single item Stanford Leisure-Time Activity Categorical Item (LCAT), which comprises six activity categories ranging from sedentary to very active based on national health recommendations determined by the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Heart Association. Each category corresponds to an intensity level based on metabolic equivalents (METs). Participants selected the category that best described their physical activity over the past month. Sleep disturbance Sleep disturbance was assessed using the 6-item Sleep Disturbance short form from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System item bank [34]. Participants reported sleep quality over the past week on a 5-point scale (Very PoorVery Good) and frequency of sleep disturbance in the past week on a 5-point scale (Not at allVery Much). A mean score was calculated for each individual, with higher scores indicating greater sleep disturbance (? = 0.90). Alcohol use Alcohol use was measured by the 3-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-C [35]. Participants indicated quantity of drinks on a typical day in the past year using a 6- point scale (010 or more drinks), frequency of drinking behavior in the past 30 days on a 6-point scale (NeverSix or more times a week) and frequency of binge drinking behavior in the past year on a 5-point scale (NeverDaily or Almost Daily). All three items were summed to calculate a total alcohol use score (? = 0.75). Disordered eating Disordered eating was measured using the 12-item Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire Short (EDE-QS) [36]. Participants indicated their eating and food-related behaviors, thoughts, and feelings over the past 7 days on a 4- point rating scale (07 days or Not at allMarkedly). Response values range from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating higher eating disorder symptomatology. A mean disordered eating score was calculated (? = 0.89). Comfort eating Comfort eating was defined as, When feeling a negative emotion, some people eat more food and/or eat more unhealthy food than usuala behavior described as comfort eating. Participants indicated their frequency of comfort eating by selecting the number of days they engaged in comfort eating in the last 30 days. This item is distinct from disordered eating, as measured by the EDE-QS, which assesses food intake and compulsive exercise in relation to weight and body image concerns. Perceived weight status We assessed perceived weight status on a 7-point Likert scale (Very UnderweightVery Overweight) in which participants identified their perceived weight category [37]. Body mass index (BMI) BMI was calculated from self-reported height and weight and categorized as: Underweight, 30. Covariates Covariates of age, highest level of education, gender (Woman, Man, Non-Binary/Other), race/ethnicity, and BMI were included in the analyses to test the independent effect of weight stigma on the outcomes. Analytic strategy Exploratory analyses We employed a two-stage investigation to run exploratory and confirmatory analyses [38]. In stage 1, exploratory analyses were conducted on a random subset (n = 438) to examine associations between weight stigma and the dependent variables: physical activity, sleep disturbance, alcohol use, disordered eating, and comfort eating, controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and BMI. Linear regression models estimated for each behavioral variable found that all health behaviors except for physical activity were significantly associated with the composite weight stigma measure. These exploratory analyses appear in Online Supplementary Materials 1. In stage 2, only the remaining unexamined data (N = 1327) were used to conduct the confirmatory analyses. As noted in the pre-registration, physical activity was included despite it not emerging as significant in preliminary analyses given the conflicting existing literature. In our analyses, we controlled for BMI to ensure that the relationship between weight stigma and health behaviors was not a result of confounder bias, that is, to ensure that this relationship did not emerge simply because higher BMI individuals report both greater weight stigma and poorer health behaviors. It is possible that BMI is instead a collider, or a variable that is caused by both our predictor and outcome variables [39]. Controlling for a collider can artificially create an association where one may not exist. Although greater weight stigma [40] and poorer health behaviors [41] can predict higher BMI, the results from our unadjusted models (see Table 3) are consistent with the adjusted models, suggesting that controlling for BMI does not introduce collider bias. We also examined BMI as a moderator of the relationship between weight stigma and health behaviors, as previous work has shown that effects of weight stigma exposure increase as weight increases [42]. Statistical analyses Using linear regression models, the composite weight stigma score was entered as the main predictor variable and 1502 K. M. Lee et al. the following health behaviors were entered as the dependent variables in separate models: physical activity, sleep disturbance, alcohol use, disordered eating, and comfort eating. Age, education, race/ethnicity, gender, and BMI were included as a priori covariates. All variables were normally distributed, except for comfort eating in the exploratory and confirmatory samples. The skewed distributions were corrected using natural log transformations and all analyses were performed with the natural log values for comfort eating. For moderation analyses, PROCESS macro (model #1) [43] was used to test the effects of BMI, perceived weight status, and gender as unique moderators on the relationship between weight stigma and all health behaviors. The same covariates were included in these models. BMI was added as a covariate in the models testing perceived weight status and gender as moderators. Given that the same pattern of results emerged for perceived weight status, these analyses appear in Online Supplementary Materials 2.

RESULTS 

The overall sample (N = 1327) had a mean age of 47.7 years (SD = 17.2) with an average BMI of 28.0 (SD = 7.4; range: 12.068.4). Table 1 lists sample characteristics for confirmatory and exploratory samples. Those with missing data were excluded from the confirmatory analyses: BMI (n = 1), physical activity (n = 4), and comfort eating (n = 2). Confirmatory zero-order correlations among study variables appear in Table 2 and exploratory zero-order correlations and descriptive statistics appear in Table 4. In the confirmatory sample, 42% of participants reported weight stigma. Linear regressions estimated the associations between weight stigma and the continuous outcomes of physical activity, sleep disturbance, alcohol use, disordered eating, and comfort eating (Table 3). Adjusting for covariates of age, BMI, education, gender, and race/ethnicity, weight stigma was significantly associated with all outcomes, except for physical activity. These findings replicate those of the exploratory regression analyses from stage 1 of the investigation (see Online Supplementary Materials 1). Unadjusted models showed significant associations between weight stigma and all outcomes (Table 3). Eta-squared (?2 ) effect size calculations indicate that weight stigma uniquely accounted for 17.5% of the variance in disordered eating; 4.0% of the variance in sleep disturbance; 3.2% of the variance in comfort eating; and 0.7% of the variance for alcohol use. Moderation models tested whether BMI modified the association of weight stigma with outcomes. BMI significantly moderated the association of weight stigma with disordered eating (b = ?0.01, SE = 0.002, 95% CI [?0.01, ?0.005], t(1319) = ?4.45, p < 0.001; Fig. 1) and alcohol use (b = ?0.03, SE = 0.01, 95% CI [?0.05, ?0.01], t (1319) = ?2.72, p = 0.007; Fig. 2), but not the other health behaviors (see Online Supplementary Materials 3, Table 3). Using the JohnsonNeyman technique, the relationship between weight stigma and disordered eating appeared to be weaker as BMI increased, up to a BMI of 55.5 (severe obesity) and between weight stigma and alcohol, up to a BMI of 32.09 (obesity). Lastly, exploratory moderation analyses were conducted to test the effect of gender on the relationship between weight stigma and health behaviors. No significant interaction effects were observed (see Online Supplementary Materials 3, Table 4).

DISCUSSION 

The present study employed a two-stage research investigation to examine the relationship between weight stigma and several health behaviors in a large sample of U.S. adults. As predicted, weight stigma was significantly associated with greater disordered eating, comfort eating, alcohol use, and sleep disturbance, after controlling for covariates. No such relationship was observed for physical activity. Targeting health behaviors (e.g., eating) to achieve weight loss is common in weight-focused health promotion policies. These policies assume that individuals can improve their health by losing weight, employing weight stigma as one strategy for motivating behavior change [5]. However, our findings indicate that weight stigma is associated with poorer health behaviors, independent of BMI. Given that physical health and weight are largely shaped by factors outside of an individuals control (i.e., genetics and social determinants like socioeconomic status) [5], it is concerning that multiple behaviors, for which individuals have some control over, may be undermined by weight stigma. Furthermore, a lower BMI may not necessarily be protective against weight stigma. In our sample, individuals across the weight spectrum, not only those with overweight or obese BMIs, reported weight stigma. In fact, moderation analyses indicated that individuals with lower BMIs showed greater disordered eating and alcohol use in the face of weight stigma. These results emerged despite individuals with higher weight reporting greater daily weight stigma. One explanation for the observed differences in health behavioral outcomes across the weight spectrum is that infrequent health behaviors may be less likely to be enacted as coping strategies. For instance, previous research has shown that alcohol use decreases as BMI increases among females with higher weight [44]. Thus, using food, instead of alcohol, may be the more common coping strategy among individuals with higher BMIs, as previous research suggests [45]. Nonetheless, the sizes of the moderation effects were very small, with some confidence intervals functionally at zero, and thus further interpretation of the present findings should only be done with caution. Prior research has found conflicting evidence for the relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. Some studies have found that greater weight stigma is associated with short-term increases in reported exercise behavior [16, 46]. Others have shown that weight stigma is positively correlated with increased exercise avoidance, but has no direct link to self-reported exercise [14, 47]. The current study adds to the latter base of evidence showing no relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. One possible explanation is that participants were asked about their daily experiences with weight stigma, which may not correspond to their level of physical activity over the past month. Ecological momentary assessment methodology may provide better insight into this relationship, as demonstrated by Vartanian et al. who examined health motivations following stigmatizing events in daily life [48]. Despite emerging evidence that weight stigma is prevalent among men [28], there is a lack of research on mens health outcomes related to weight stigma. In this study, moderation by gender was not observed for any outcome. These results are consistent with previous research reporting no gender differences in poor health outcomes such as mortality and obesity due to weight stigma [3, 49]. Men may also feel pressured to meet societal body standards and thus may display the same magnitude of associations between weight stigma and health behaviors. It is recommended that the null gender findings are interpreted with caution, as more research is needed. How might weight stigma influence an individuals health behaviors? One potential mechanism is stress. Previous work suggests that weight stigma is stressful [6, 50] and experimental lab studies manipulating weight stigma have shown that individuals with higher weight, as well as those who perceive themselves as overweight, show elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol following exposure to a weight-stigmatizing event [51, 52]. Additionally, some research has found that individuals who experience more weight-based discrimination have higher hair cortisol levelsa finding most pronounced in those at the highest BMI [53]. Individuals who experience greater stress may engage in more unhealthy coping behaviors. Indeed, stress can drive changes in behaviors such as eating, physical activity, and sleep [54]. For example, Tataranni et al. administered synthetic cortisol vs. placebo and found greater food consumption in the cortisol group [55]. This early work is supported by accumulating evidence that cortisol is associated with increased caloric intake and greater abdominal fat storage [56]. The health behavior pathway may not be independent from that of stress but rather reflect a serial mediation model, wherein weight stigma increases stress that in turn causes decrements in health behaviors. The present study contributes to the weight stigma literature in several ways. As noted, a key strength of this study is the assessment of several health behaviors within a large, national census-matched sample. Previous studies that have examined weight stigma in relation to different health behaviors have often had small sample sizes or were limited to female subjects. Thus, the present study may provide more generalizable information about health behaviors in the U.S. A related strength of the study is that higher BMI scores were well-represented in the sample, with 31.4% meeting BMI criteria for obesity. This is a closer estimate of the proportion of the American population that is classified with obesity (42%) compared to previous studies [57]. Therefore, there is greater confidence that these findings reflect the experiences of individuals with obesity in the population, aiding generalizability. Lastly, we enhance reproducibility by presenting a twostage research program of exploratory and confirmatory analyses based on recommended open science practices. There are some limitations to consider. First, a composite weight stigma score was used due to survey constraints. While early tests indicate good construct validity, additional psychometric testing is warranted (see Online Supplementary Materials 4). Another limitation is the use of selfreported weight, which is subject to inaccuracies. Additionally, the data collection period overlapped with winter holidays. Individuals may have made new years health resolutions, and therefore the self-reported health behaviors may be more indicative of newly established goals rather than typical health habits. However, such resolutions would likely dampen, rather than magnify, the relationship between weight stigma and poor health behaviors. Lastly, the study is cross-sectional and therefore causal direction cannot be determined. Weight stigma may operate as a feedback loop that leads to weight gain through certain behaviors such as comfort eating [6], but further investigation is required. Given survey constraints, weight bias internalization was not assessed. Future research should build on these findings to determine the potential role of weight bias internalization in these health behaviors. Despite these limitations, these studys findings show that weight stigma is significantly associated with several health behaviors. If future research confirms that this is indeed a causal relationship, weight stigma could cumulatively undermine physical health over time. Taken together, these findings highlight weight stigma as a potential barrier to healthy behaviors, and suggest that one strategy to improve population health may be to reduce weight stigma. Though more research is needed, it may be important to employ more weight-inclusive approaches to health promotion, such as removing stigmatizing language or weight outcomes from health policies and program objectives [5].

Weight stigma, the negative attitudes and discrimination towards individuals based on their weight, has been found to significantly impact several health behaviors, according to a recent study. The study, which focused on a large sample of adults in the United States, found that weight stigma is associated with greater disordered eating, comfort eating, alcohol use, and sleep disturbance. These findings highlight the potential barriers to healthy behaviors that weight stigma can create.

The research involved 1,327 participants who were surveyed about their experiences with weight stigma and various health behaviors. The study found that weight stigma was significantly associated with poorer health behaviors, independent of body mass index (BMI). In fact, individuals with lower BMIs showed greater disordered eating and alcohol use in the face of weight stigma. The study also found no significant gender differences in the relationship between weight stigma and health behaviors.

This research is relevant to the public because it sheds light on the harmful effects of weight stigma on health behaviors. It suggests that weight stigma can undermine efforts to engage in healthy behaviors such as eating a balanced diet, being physically active, and getting adequate sleep. By raising awareness about weight stigma and its impact on health, this research emphasizes the importance of promoting weight-inclusive approaches to health promotion and reducing stigma.

INTRODUCTION 
Weight stigma is pervasive. Higher weight individuals are stigmatized across many contexts, including healthcare, employment and income, education, media, and interpersonal relationships [1]. Repeated exposure to weight stigma may be consequential as considerable evidence suggests that weight stigma undermines physical health even when controlling for body mass index (BMI), which addresses the potential confound that higher adiposity begets both weight stigma and poorer health. For instance, weight discrimination predicts physiological dysregulation involving a suite of outcomes (e.g., blood pressure; inflammation; cholesterol) [2], and even mortality [3]. These findings indicate a vulnerable health profile of individuals stigmatized for their weight, particularly those with overweight or obesity. Yet, it remains unclear how weight stigma may also impact several health behaviors, which is one likely pathway through which weight stigma gets under the skin to generate poorer health outcomes. Scholars have previously suggested that weight stigma may play a positive role in motivating individuals to engage in health behaviors that could lead to weight losspresumably as a way to improve health [4]. This contention, however, is not empirically supported. Rather, stigmatizing individuals for their weight is consistently associated with negative consequences [5]. Although health behaviors are modifiable ways to improve health across the weight spectrum, individuals who experience weight stigma may cope with this mistreatment by engaging in health compromising behaviors. For instance, a person who has been stigmatized because of their size may be less likely to go to the gym, as this is an environment that puts them at risk for further stigmatization. Individuals encountering weight stigma may also eat to comfort their distress [6]. Although previous research has shown that, independent of BMI, weight stigma is associated with increased maladaptive eating behaviors and decreased motivation to exercise [7], less is known about other common health behaviors such as alcohol use and sleep. Thus, the present study examined the relationship between weight stigma and several modifiable health behaviors in a large U.S. sample. In the next section, the existing literature on weight stigma is outlined across four different health behaviors: eating behavior, physical activity, alcohol use, and sleep. Where available, findings pertaining to gender differences in these areas of research are summarized. As will become evident below, there are notable gaps in this literature that we address in the present study. 

WEIGHT STIGMA AND EATING BEHAVIOR 

Eating a healthy diet helps prevent noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer [8]. However, weight stigma may pose one barrier to healthy eating behavior. In laboratory settings, stigmatizing individuals with higher weight (or individuals who perceived themselves as such) led to short-term increases in eating of highfat, -sugar, and -calorie foods [9]. This eating is theorized to be a form of comfort eating due to the stress of weight stigma [6] and at least one study has found an association between weight stigma and emotional eating [10]. Weight stigma is also associated with unhealthy weight control behaviors and disordered eating such as binge eating [11]. Additionally, there is some longitudinal evidence that shows the potential long-term effects of weight stigma on adolescents eating and weight control practices. For example, one study found that adolescent girls who were labeled too fat showed increased bulimic and unhealthy weight control behaviors (e.g., using diet pills) 5 years later [12]. 

WEIGHT STIGMA AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 

Engaging in regular physical activity is associated with numerous health benefits, including lower risk for premature all-cause mortality, hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [13]. For higher weight individuals, weight stigma may be a barrier to engage in physical activity, though the findings are mixed. Some studies have shown that weight stigma is associated with greater exercise avoidance [14] and lower exercise selfefficacy and intentions [15]. One study found that weight bias internalization was associated with lower levels of exercise and self-efficacy, while experienced weight stigma predicted higher levels of exercise [16]. Yet other research found a positive relationship between weight discrimination and greater sedentary behavior among middle-aged and older adults [17]. 

WEIGHT STIGMA AND ALCOHOL USE 

Alcohol consumption, particularly heavy drinking, has been associated with heart disease, stroke, and some cancers [18]. There is a large body of research showing that perceived discrimination on the basis of other stigmatized identities is linked to substance use, including alcohol [19] and preliminary evidence suggests that experiencing weight stigma is associated with alcohol dependence [20]. Internalizing anti-fat attitudes may also encourage unhealthy coping mechanisms, as seen with medical students of higher weight who turn to alcohol or drugs [21]. Given the link between psychological distress and alcohol consumption [22], it is also plausible that the distress associated with weight stigma spurs unhealthy alcohol consumption. 

WEIGHT STIGMA AND SLEEP DISTURBANCE 

There is a noticeable lack of research in the weight stigma literature on sleep [23], but there is reason to believe a relationship may exist given research on other stigmatized identities. For example, one systematic review found strong evidence that perceived discrimination is associated with poorer sleep, from both cross-sectional and prospective data [24]. In a large, nationally representative U.S. sample, individuals who experienced more everyday discrimination had worse objective sleep and reported greater sleep difficulties [25]. Another representative study found that perceived racial discrimination in healthcare environments independently predicted sleep disturbance [26]. Individuals with higher weight may likewise experience disturbed sleep given the chronic and pervasive nature of weight stigma. 

WEIGHT STIGMA AND GENDER DIFFERENCES 

A significant portion of weight stigma research has focused on women with higher weight. The dearth of research on men is likely due in part to evidence that women are more likely to experience weight stigma [27]. However, recent findings indicate that weight stigma is prevalent among men as well [28]. Previous research has also shown that not all weight stigma findings related to health behaviors are uniform across genders. For example, one study found that weight teasing by family members was associated with unhealthy weight control behaviors (e.g., skipping meals, fasting) among both males and females, however only females reported extreme weight control behaviors (e.g., using laxatives, vomiting) [29]. Gender differences have also been documented in adolescence as weight-related teasing predicted greater unhealthy weight control behaviors among boys, while girls were more likely to diet [30]. In the domain of physical activity, weight stigma was associated with more vigorous physical activity among higher weight men, but not for women [31]. In sum, there is still much to be determined in the domain of weight stigma and health behaviors. The present study fills a critical gap in the extant literature by examining multiple health behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sleep, alcohol use, eating behavior) at once, across gender and weight status. It was hypothesized that: (1) Greater weight stigma would be associated with poorer health behaviors in the domains of physical activity, sleep disturbance, alcohol use, disordered eating, and comfort eating; (2) Weight status would moderate the association of weight stigma with health behaviors, such that the relationship would be stronger for individuals with higher BMIs and selfperceived weight. Given limited prior research, we made no directional hypotheses regarding gender differences. All a priori hypotheses and confirmatory analyses were preregistered on the Open Science Framework, https://osf.io/ g4wz9?view_only=d0fafe6d7cc24846b1b1cd6b59a3783e.

METHODS 

Participants The UCLA North General Institutional Review Board approved the present study. Participants (N = 2022) in the United States were recruited for the Eating in America Study through a panel on the online survey platform, Qualtrics, between December 2019 and January 2020. Individuals who were English speaking and at least 18 years of age were eligible to participate. Individuals were census matched according to national quotas for age, self-reported gender, income, race/ethnicity, and census region in the U. S. Eligible participants reviewed an online information sheet and gave their consent to participate. Several steps were taken to obtain the final analytic sample in this cross-sectional study. First, a random sample (n = 500) was removed from the full dataset (N = 2022) to conduct exploratory analyses; the final exploratory sample was comprised of 438 participants after exclusion criteria were applied. Then, participants were removed from the full dataset if they met at least one of the following exclusion criteria: failed attention checks (n = 202), biologically implausible height (90 inches; n = 25), weight (1000 lb; n = 29), or BMI values (70; n = 65) [32]. This yielded a sample size of 1759 after removing 263 individuals. Finally, any individuals from the exploratory sample who had not already been excluded were removed to obtain the final sample (N = 1327 participants). The exploratory sample was not included in the confirmatory analyses. Measures Participants completed a series of self-report measures, including assessments of daily experiences with anticipated weight stigma and weight-based discrimination, physical activity, sleep disturbance, alcohol use, disordered eating, comfort eating, demographic questions, and anthropometric measurements. Weight stigma Weight stigma was assessed using a 2-item composite measure of daily anticipated and experienced weight stigma (see validation work in Online Supplementary Materials 4). Individuals indicated the frequency of anticipating weight stigma (In your day-to-day life, how often are you concerned about or worried you will be negatively stereotyped or mistreated because of your weight?) and experiencing weight stigma (In your day-to-day life, how often are you treated with less respect, harassed, or discriminated against because of your weight?) on a 4-point response scale from (Not at allOften). A mean score was computed (? = 0.86). Physical activity Physical activity was measured with the validated [33], single item Stanford Leisure-Time Activity Categorical Item (LCAT), which comprises six activity categories ranging from sedentary to very active based on national health recommendations determined by the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Heart Association. Each category corresponds to an intensity level based on metabolic equivalents (METs). Participants selected the category that best described their physical activity over the past month. Sleep disturbance Sleep disturbance was assessed using the 6-item Sleep Disturbance short form from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System item bank [34]. Participants reported sleep quality over the past week on a 5-point scale (Very PoorVery Good) and frequency of sleep disturbance in the past week on a 5-point scale (Not at allVery Much). A mean score was calculated for each individual, with higher scores indicating greater sleep disturbance (? = 0.90). Alcohol use Alcohol use was measured by the 3-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-C [35]. Participants indicated quantity of drinks on a typical day in the past year using a 6- point scale (010 or more drinks), frequency of drinking behavior in the past 30 days on a 6-point scale (NeverSix or more times a week) and frequency of binge drinking behavior in the past year on a 5-point scale (NeverDaily or Almost Daily). All three items were summed to calculate a total alcohol use score (? = 0.75). Disordered eating Disordered eating was measured using the 12-item Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire Short (EDE-QS) [36]. Participants indicated their eating and food-related behaviors, thoughts, and feelings over the past 7 days on a 4- point rating scale (07 days or Not at allMarkedly). Response values range from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating higher eating disorder symptomatology. A mean disordered eating score was calculated (? = 0.89). Comfort eating Comfort eating was defined as, When feeling a negative emotion, some people eat more food and/or eat more unhealthy food than usuala behavior described as comfort eating. Participants indicated their frequency of comfort eating by selecting the number of days they engaged in comfort eating in the last 30 days. This item is distinct from disordered eating, as measured by the EDE-QS, which assesses food intake and compulsive exercise in relation to weight and body image concerns. Perceived weight status We assessed perceived weight status on a 7-point Likert scale (Very UnderweightVery Overweight) in which participants identified their perceived weight category [37]. Body mass index (BMI) BMI was calculated from self-reported height and weight and categorized as: Underweight, 30. Covariates Covariates of age, highest level of education, gender (Woman, Man, Non-Binary/Other), race/ethnicity, and BMI were included in the analyses to test the independent effect of weight stigma on the outcomes. Analytic strategy Exploratory analyses We employed a two-stage investigation to run exploratory and confirmatory analyses [38]. In stage 1, exploratory analyses were conducted on a random subset (n = 438) to examine associations between weight stigma and the dependent variables: physical activity, sleep disturbance, alcohol use, disordered eating, and comfort eating, controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and BMI. Linear regression models estimated for each behavioral variable found that all health behaviors except for physical activity were significantly associated with the composite weight stigma measure. These exploratory analyses appear in Online Supplementary Materials 1. In stage 2, only the remaining unexamined data (N = 1327) were used to conduct the confirmatory analyses. As noted in the pre-registration, physical activity was included despite it not emerging as significant in preliminary analyses given the conflicting existing literature. In our analyses, we controlled for BMI to ensure that the relationship between weight stigma and health behaviors was not a result of confounder bias, that is, to ensure that this relationship did not emerge simply because higher BMI individuals report both greater weight stigma and poorer health behaviors. It is possible that BMI is instead a collider, or a variable that is caused by both our predictor and outcome variables [39]. Controlling for a collider can artificially create an association where one may not exist. Although greater weight stigma [40] and poorer health behaviors [41] can predict higher BMI, the results from our unadjusted models (see Table 3) are consistent with the adjusted models, suggesting that controlling for BMI does not introduce collider bias. We also examined BMI as a moderator of the relationship between weight stigma and health behaviors, as previous work has shown that effects of weight stigma exposure increase as weight increases [42]. Statistical analyses Using linear regression models, the composite weight stigma score was entered as the main predictor variable and 1502 K. M. Lee et al. the following health behaviors were entered as the dependent variables in separate models: physical activity, sleep disturbance, alcohol use, disordered eating, and comfort eating. Age, education, race/ethnicity, gender, and BMI were included as a priori covariates. All variables were normally distributed, except for comfort eating in the exploratory and confirmatory samples. The skewed distributions were corrected using natural log transformations and all analyses were performed with the natural log values for comfort eating. For moderation analyses, PROCESS macro (model #1) [43] was used to test the effects of BMI, perceived weight status, and gender as unique moderators on the relationship between weight stigma and all health behaviors. The same covariates were included in these models. BMI was added as a covariate in the models testing perceived weight status and gender as moderators. Given that the same pattern of results emerged for perceived weight status, these analyses appear in Online Supplementary Materials 2.

RESULTS 

The overall sample (N = 1327) had a mean age of 47.7 years (SD = 17.2) with an average BMI of 28.0 (SD = 7.4; range: 12.068.4). Table 1 lists sample characteristics for confirmatory and exploratory samples. Those with missing data were excluded from the confirmatory analyses: BMI (n = 1), physical activity (n = 4), and comfort eating (n = 2). Confirmatory zero-order correlations among study variables appear in Table 2 and exploratory zero-order correlations and descriptive statistics appear in Table 4. In the confirmatory sample, 42% of participants reported weight stigma. Linear regressions estimated the associations between weight stigma and the continuous outcomes of physical activity, sleep disturbance, alcohol use, disordered eating, and comfort eating (Table 3). Adjusting for covariates of age, BMI, education, gender, and race/ethnicity, weight stigma was significantly associated with all outcomes, except for physical activity. These findings replicate those of the exploratory regression analyses from stage 1 of the investigation (see Online Supplementary Materials 1). Unadjusted models showed significant associations between weight stigma and all outcomes (Table 3). Eta-squared (?2 ) effect size calculations indicate that weight stigma uniquely accounted for 17.5% of the variance in disordered eating; 4.0% of the variance in sleep disturbance; 3.2% of the variance in comfort eating; and 0.7% of the variance for alcohol use. Moderation models tested whether BMI modified the association of weight stigma with outcomes. BMI significantly moderated the association of weight stigma with disordered eating (b = ?0.01, SE = 0.002, 95% CI [?0.01, ?0.005], t(1319) = ?4.45, p < 0.001; Fig. 1) and alcohol use (b = ?0.03, SE = 0.01, 95% CI [?0.05, ?0.01], t (1319) = ?2.72, p = 0.007; Fig. 2), but not the other health behaviors (see Online Supplementary Materials 3, Table 3). Using the JohnsonNeyman technique, the relationship between weight stigma and disordered eating appeared to be weaker as BMI increased, up to a BMI of 55.5 (severe obesity) and between weight stigma and alcohol, up to a BMI of 32.09 (obesity). Lastly, exploratory moderation analyses were conducted to test the effect of gender on the relationship between weight stigma and health behaviors. No significant interaction effects were observed (see Online Supplementary Materials 3, Table 4).

DISCUSSION 

The present study employed a two-stage research investigation to examine the relationship between weight stigma and several health behaviors in a large sample of U.S. adults. As predicted, weight stigma was significantly associated with greater disordered eating, comfort eating, alcohol use, and sleep disturbance, after controlling for covariates. No such relationship was observed for physical activity. Targeting health behaviors (e.g., eating) to achieve weight loss is common in weight-focused health promotion policies. These policies assume that individuals can improve their health by losing weight, employing weight stigma as one strategy for motivating behavior change [5]. However, our findings indicate that weight stigma is associated with poorer health behaviors, independent of BMI. Given that physical health and weight are largely shaped by factors outside of an individuals control (i.e., genetics and social determinants like socioeconomic status) [5], it is concerning that multiple behaviors, for which individuals have some control over, may be undermined by weight stigma. Furthermore, a lower BMI may not necessarily be protective against weight stigma. In our sample, individuals across the weight spectrum, not only those with overweight or obese BMIs, reported weight stigma. In fact, moderation analyses indicated that individuals with lower BMIs showed greater disordered eating and alcohol use in the face of weight stigma. These results emerged despite individuals with higher weight reporting greater daily weight stigma. One explanation for the observed differences in health behavioral outcomes across the weight spectrum is that infrequent health behaviors may be less likely to be enacted as coping strategies. For instance, previous research has shown that alcohol use decreases as BMI increases among females with higher weight [44]. Thus, using food, instead of alcohol, may be the more common coping strategy among individuals with higher BMIs, as previous research suggests [45]. Nonetheless, the sizes of the moderation effects were very small, with some confidence intervals functionally at zero, and thus further interpretation of the present findings should only be done with caution. Prior research has found conflicting evidence for the relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. Some studies have found that greater weight stigma is associated with short-term increases in reported exercise behavior [16, 46]. Others have shown that weight stigma is positively correlated with increased exercise avoidance, but has no direct link to self-reported exercise [14, 47]. The current study adds to the latter base of evidence showing no relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. One possible explanation is that participants were asked about their daily experiences with weight stigma, which may not correspond to their level of physical activity over the past month. Ecological momentary assessment methodology may provide better insight into this relationship, as demonstrated by Vartanian et al. who examined health motivations following stigmatizing events in daily life [48]. Despite emerging evidence that weight stigma is prevalent among men [28], there is a lack of research on mens health outcomes related to weight stigma. In this study, moderation by gender was not observed for any outcome. These results are consistent with previous research reporting no gender differences in poor health outcomes such as mortality and obesity due to weight stigma [3, 49]. Men may also feel pressured to meet societal body standards and thus may display the same magnitude of associations between weight stigma and health behaviors. It is recommended that the null gender findings are interpreted with caution, as more research is needed. How might weight stigma influence an individuals health behaviors? One potential mechanism is stress. Previous work suggests that weight stigma is stressful [6, 50] and experimental lab studies manipulating weight stigma have shown that individuals with higher weight, as well as those who perceive themselves as overweight, show elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol following exposure to a weight-stigmatizing event [51, 52]. Additionally, some research has found that individuals who experience more weight-based discrimination have higher hair cortisol levelsa finding most pronounced in those at the highest BMI [53]. Individuals who experience greater stress may engage in more unhealthy coping behaviors. Indeed, stress can drive changes in behaviors such as eating, physical activity, and sleep [54]. For example, Tataranni et al. administered synthetic cortisol vs. placebo and found greater food consumption in the cortisol group [55]. This early work is supported by accumulating evidence that cortisol is associated with increased caloric intake and greater abdominal fat storage [56]. The health behavior pathway may not be independent from that of stress but rather reflect a serial mediation model, wherein weight stigma increases stress that in turn causes decrements in health behaviors. The present study contributes to the weight stigma literature in several ways. As noted, a key strength of this study is the assessment of several health behaviors within a large, national census-matched sample. Previous studies that have examined weight stigma in relation to different health behaviors have often had small sample sizes or were limited to female subjects. Thus, the present study may provide more generalizable information about health behaviors in the U.S. A related strength of the study is that higher BMI scores were well-represented in the sample, with 31.4% meeting BMI criteria for obesity. This is a closer estimate of the proportion of the American population that is classified with obesity (42%) compared to previous studies [57]. Therefore, there is greater confidence that these findings reflect the experiences of individuals with obesity in the population, aiding generalizability. Lastly, we enhance reproducibility by presenting a twostage research program of exploratory and confirmatory analyses based on recommended open science practices. There are some limitations to consider. First, a composite weight stigma score was used due to survey constraints. While early tests indicate good construct validity, additional psychometric testing is warranted (see Online Supplementary Materials 4). Another limitation is the use of selfreported weight, which is subject to inaccuracies. Additionally, the data collection period overlapped with winter holidays. Individuals may have made new years health resolutions, and therefore the self-reported health behaviors may be more indicative of newly established goals rather than typical health habits. However, such resolutions would likely dampen, rather than magnify, the relationship between weight stigma and poor health behaviors. Lastly, the study is cross-sectional and therefore causal direction cannot be determined. Weight stigma may operate as a feedback loop that leads to weight gain through certain behaviors such as comfort eating [6], but further investigation is required. Given survey constraints, weight bias internalization was not assessed. Future research should build on these findings to determine the potential role of weight bias internalization in these health behaviors. Despite these limitations, these studys findings show that weight stigma is significantly associated with several health behaviors. If future research confirms that this is indeed a causal relationship, weight stigma could cumulatively undermine physical health over time. Taken together, these findings highlight weight stigma as a potential barrier to healthy behaviors, and suggest that one strategy to improve population health may be to reduce weight stigma. Though more research is needed, it may be important to employ more weight-inclusive approaches to health promotion, such as removing stigmatizing language or weight outcomes from health policies and program objectives [5].

Do not label the headline and summary.","Subject: Weight Stigma and Health Behaviors: New Research Findings

Weight stigma, or discrimination based on weight, is a pervasive issue that affects individuals in various aspects of their lives. A recent study called the Eating in America Study explored the relationship between weight stigma and different health behaviors. The study found that weight stigma is associated with poorer health behaviors, including disordered eating, comfort eating, alcohol use, and sleep disturbance. These associations remained significant even after controlling for factors like age, education, gender, race/ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI). However, the study did not find a significant relationship between weight stigma and physical activity.

The research included a large sample of over 2,000 participants from the United States. The participants were diverse in terms of age, gender, and weight status. The findings suggest that weight stigma can have detrimental effects on health behaviors, regardless of an individual's BMI. This highlights the importance of addressing weight stigma and promoting weight-inclusive approaches to health.

Weight stigma can be a significant barrier to adopting healthy behaviors. It may lead individuals to engage in unhealthy coping mechanisms, such as comfort eating, and discourage them from participating in activities like exercise. By understanding the impact of weight stigma on health behaviors, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and supportive environment for everyone, regardless of their weight.

I thought you might find this research interesting and relevant, especially considering the ongoing discussions around body positivity and weight discrimination. Let me know if you'd like more information or if you have any questions!"
