{"text1_prompt00": {"text": "The Impact of Sleep Duration on Performance Among Competitive Athletes: A Systematic Literature Review  \n\nDISCUSSION \nThis literature review, although diverse in the range of sports, methods, and outcomes studied, provides several stylized facts that can inform sleep research and competitive athletes. First, out of all the published studies we reviewed, none found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome. All of the results reviewed showed that either the increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Note that among studies reporting significant positive results, effect sizes varied considerably (Tables 2-4), likely due to differences in the duration of sleep deprivation/extension experienced as well as differences in outcome measures. Second, when considering the aerobic and anaerobic characteristics of sports, it seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. For instance, Mejri et al40 found that depriving competitive taekwondo boxers of a mere 3 to 4 hours of sleep significantly impaired performance on the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test. By contrast, Blumert et al33 employed a relatively severe sleep deprivation protocol by depriving 9 national-caliber collegiate weightlifters of 24 hours of sleep and yet failed to identify adverse effects on any of the various weightlifting exercises examined. Relatedly, for both endurance and explosive, power-based exercises, it has been well documented that sleep deprivation is associated with increased perceived effort.56\u009658 Still, the relationship between perceived effort and objective performance has not been widely validated and is a topic for future investigation. Third, of the studies that measured outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills, most find benefits of sleep on performance. Tennis serving accuracy and basketball shooting were both improved by long-term sleep extension interventions,35,39 and tennis serving accuracy suffered when players were deprived of 2 to 2.5 hours of sleep at the beginning of the preceding night.37 Regarding studies conducted in players of team sports that incorporated tactics and decision-based outcomes to a broader extent, soccer as well as rugby players exhibited performance deficits after nights of decreased sleep duration.34 These results are in line with other literature demonstrating clear neurocognitive deficits in the setting of inadequate sleep in the general population, reviewed thoroughly elsewhere.59,60 Finally, when looking at the methodologies of the experimental studies, we found that the studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Interestingly although most acute sleep interventions involved sleep deprivation and yielded positive results, there were inconsistent results among the 2 acute sleep extension studies.15,38 Conversely, the majority of longer-term sleep intervention studies involved sleep extension and showed positive results.35,39,49 Taken together, these findings suggest that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. On the other hand, more research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. The reliability and precision of the various measurements may present challenges in interpretation of these studies. For example, \u0093maximal\u0094 voluntary muscle contraction and voluntarily chosen training load are variable across subjects.61,62 On the other hand, \u0093running economy,\u0094 the oxygen cost associated with a given running velocity, has low variability among highly trained runners and is significantly correlated with cardiorespiratory parameters used to assess aerobic capacity.63 A meta-analysis of the reliability of various measures of muscle power previously identified that field running tests tended to be more reliable than treadmill running tests, tests lasting up to 1 minute tended to be more reliable than those lasting greater than 1 minute (likely due to increased variability in muscle movement and limb positioning), and isokinetic tests tended to be more reliable when measuring muscle extension versus flexion.62 Somewhat reassuringly in the context of the present review, this metaanalysis also found that measurements taken from athletes were more reliable than those taken from non-athlete subjects. With respect to the validity of outcome measures reported as performance indicators, the nature of the sport (eg, team vs individual) may be an important determinant of whether what is measured in the laboratory translates to the actual game. For instance, for team-based sports requiring complex game structure such as soccer, measures of muscle force production or running speed are likely insufficient to provide an accurate assessment of in-game performance, although they may be helpful in making gross approximations and predictions.64 Of course, actual performance metrics from real or simulated games would be the ideal outcomes to quantify for such sports in future investigations. More specifically, for performance outcomes included in the current review, the following have been independently validated and shown to be reliable measures of athletic performance: Yo-Yo intermittent recovery (YYIR) test, isometric muscle contraction, squat, countermovement jump, free sthrow basketball shooting, tennis serving, shuttle-running tests, and Wingate test.42\u009648 In Table 1, we have indicated studies employing previously validated and reliable metrics of objective performance with asterisks (as per the criteria discussed above). Still, more work will be required to further validate the various performance outcomes measured in the studies reviewed in the present work, especially those involving complex, team-based measures such as composite game performance scores and passing accuracy. Likewise, given the high inter-individual variability of sleep variables used across the included studies, these metrics will also require further investigation to determine their precision and reliability as predictors of athletic performance. Importantly, we chose to require at least one objective performance measure among our inclusion criteria. The previous work relying on self-perceived performance, although informative in understanding the potential effect of sleep loss or gain on sports psychology,15 may not accurately reflect actual performance, as was the goal of the present work. However, under certain circumstances, self-perceived pre-game wellness (including self-reported sleep quality) may be predictive of objective in-game performance.65 More research will be needed to assess the validity of playerreported performance and objective performance, especially when athletes exhibit compromised sleep. Several experimental studies are particularly illustrative of the various trends in the results we have just outlined. To address the question of whether one night of sleep extension would be sufficient to improve various fitness indices among semi-professional soccer players, Fullagar et al15 tested a sleep hygiene intervention. The investigators implemented a sleep hygiene strategy (SHS) designed to maximize sleep duration and limit stimulation before bedtime to test whether this would be sufficient to improve either anaerobic (jumping height and force production) or aerobic endurance (Yo\u0096Yo intermittent recovery level 2, YYIR2) performance after latenight soccer matches. Implementing a randomized design, they assigned 20 participants to follow either their normal post-match sleep routine [non-SHS (NSHS)] or a SHS involving early dimming of lights and lights out by midnight, cool room temperature, and no technology or light stimulation for 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. Actigraphy was used to measure sleep patterns, and sleep diary was used for subjective recall of sleep quality. Despite finding that those assigned to the SHS indeed exhibited increased sleep duration after the night match relative to those in the NSHS group, the investigators failed to identify any improvements in\ncountermovement jump height, countermovement jump force production, or YYIR2 performance, tested over the following 2 days. On the other hand, as we have discussed, studies of acute sleep deprivation, especially those measuring technical performance outcomes, tended to yield positive results. Given that sleep is often disrupted the night before athletic competition,66 athletes involved in sports requiring these types of skills are likely to be particularly sensitive to sleep manipulations and thus should be counseled regarding the importance of sleep for game performance. Relatedly, chronic sleep extension studies have demonstrated significant benefits to athletes.35,49 Thus, strategies to improve sleep not only the night before an important sports event but also in the weeks leading up to this event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance. \nPage 1 of 1  \n\n", "system_role": "You are an expert at science communication.", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 1000, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "qna": {"article_title": "The Impact of Sleep Duration on Performance Among Competitive Athletes: A Systematic Literature Review  ", "system_role": "You are an expert at science communication.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "text": "The Impact of Sleep Duration on Performance Among Competitive Athletes: A Systematic Literature Review  \n\nDISCUSSION \nThis literature review, although diverse in the range of sports, methods, and outcomes studied, provides several stylized facts that can inform sleep research and competitive athletes.

The review found that sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance, with no negative associations found. However, the effect size varied depending on the type of activity and outcome measures. Aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, and studies measuring outcomes requiring tactical and/or technical skills found benefits of sleep on performance. Short-term sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, but in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. Strategies to improve sleep not only the night before an important sports event but also in the weeks leading up to this event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance. This information is relevant for athletes who want to optimize their performance and achieve their goals.", "preceding summary": "\"Sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance, according to a systematic literature review of published studies.

First, out of all the published studies we reviewed, none found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome. All of the results reviewed showed that either the increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Note that among studies reporting significant positive results, effect sizes varied considerably (Tables 2-4), likely due to differences in the duration of sleep deprivation/extension experienced as well as differences in outcome measures. Second, when considering the aerobic and anaerobic characteristics of sports, it seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. For instance, Mejri et al40 found that depriving competitive taekwondo boxers of a mere 3 to 4 hours of sleep significantly impaired performance on the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test. By contrast, Blumert et al33 employed a relatively severe sleep deprivation protocol by depriving 9 national-caliber collegiate weightlifters of 24 hours of sleep and yet failed to identify adverse effects on any of the various weightlifting exercises examined. Relatedly, for both endurance and explosive, power-based exercises, it has been well documented that sleep deprivation is associated with increased perceived effort.56\u009658 Still, the relationship between perceived effort and objective performance has not been widely validated and is a topic for future investigation. Third, of the studies that measured outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills, most find benefits of sleep on performance. Tennis serving accuracy and basketball shooting were both improved by long-term sleep extension interventions,35,39 and tennis serving accuracy suffered when players were deprived of 2 to 2.5 hours of sleep at the beginning of the preceding night.37 Regarding studies conducted in players of team sports that incorporated tactics and decision-based outcomes to a broader extent, soccer as well as rugby players exhibited performance deficits after nights of decreased sleep duration.34 These results are in line with other literature demonstrating clear neurocognitive deficits in the setting of inadequate sleep in the general population, reviewed thoroughly elsewhere.59,60 Finally, when looking at the methodologies of the experimental studies, we found that the studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Interestingly although most acute sleep interventions involved sleep deprivation and yielded positive results, there were inconsistent results among the 2 acute sleep extension studies.15,38 Conversely, the majority of longer-term sleep intervention studies involved sleep extension and showed positive results.35,39,49 Taken together, these findings suggest that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. On the other hand, more research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. The reliability and precision of the various measurements may present challenges in interpretation of these studies. For example, \u0093maximal\u0094 voluntary muscle contraction and voluntarily chosen training load are variable across subjects.61,62 On the other hand, \u0093running economy,\u0094 the oxygen cost associated with a given running velocity, has low variability among highly trained runners and is significantly correlated with cardiorespiratory parameters used to assess aerobic capacity.63 A meta-analysis of the reliability of various measures of muscle power previously identified that field running tests tended to be more reliable than treadmill running tests, tests lasting up to 1 minute tended to be more reliable than those lasting greater than 1 minute (likely due to increased variability in muscle movement and limb positioning), and isokinetic tests tended to be more reliable when measuring muscle extension versus flexion.62 Somewhat reassuringly in the context of the present review, this metaanalysis also found that measurements taken from athletes were more reliable than those taken from non-athlete subjects. With respect to the validity of outcome measures reported as performance indicators, the nature of the sport (eg, team vs individual) may be an important determinant of whether what is measured in the laboratory translates to the actual game. For instance, for team-based sports requiring complex game structure such as soccer, measures of muscle force production or running speed are likely insufficient to provide an accurate assessment of in-game performance, although they may be helpful in making gross approximations and predictions.64 Of course, actual performance metrics from real or simulated games would be the ideal outcomes to quantify for such sports in future investigations. More specifically, for performance outcomes included in the current review, the following have been independently validated and shown to be reliable measures of athletic performance: Yo-Yo intermittent recovery (YYIR) test, isometric muscle contraction, squat, countermovement jump, free sthrow basketball shooting, tennis serving, shuttle-running tests, and Wingate test.42\u009648 In Table 1, we have indicated studies employing previously validated and reliable metrics of objective performance with asterisks (as per the criteria discussed above). Still, more work will be required to further validate the various performance outcomes measured in the studies reviewed in the present work, especially those involving complex, team-based measures such as composite game performance scores and passing accuracy. Likewise, given the high inter-individual variability of sleep variables used across the included studies, these metrics will also require further investigation to determine their precision and reliability as predictors of athletic performance. Importantly, we chose to require at least one objective performance measure among our inclusion criteria. The previous work relying on self-perceived performance, although informative in understanding the potential effect of sleep loss or gain on sports psychology,15 may not accurately reflect actual performance, as was the goal of the present work. However, under certain circumstances, self-perceived pre-game wellness (including self-reported sleep quality) may be predictive of objective in-game performance.65 More research will be needed to assess the validity of playerreported performance and objective performance, especially when athletes exhibit compromised sleep. Several experimental studies are particularly illustrative of the various trends in the results we have just outlined. To address the question of whether one night of sleep extension would be sufficient to improve various fitness indices among semi-professional soccer players, Fullagar et al15 tested a sleep hygiene intervention. The investigators implemented a sleep hygiene strategy (SHS) designed to maximize sleep duration and limit stimulation before bedtime to test whether this would be sufficient to improve either anaerobic (jumping height and force production) or aerobic endurance (Yo\u0096Yo intermittent recovery level 2, YYIR2) performance after latenight soccer matches. Implementing a randomized design, they assigned 20 participants to follow either their normal post-match sleep routine [non-SHS (NSHS)] or a SHS involving early dimming of lights and lights out by midnight, cool room temperature, and no technology or light stimulation for 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. Actigraphy was used to measure sleep patterns, and sleep diary was used for subjective recall of sleep quality. Despite finding that those assigned to the SHS indeed exhibited increased sleep duration after the night match relative to those in the NSHS group, the investigators failed to identify any improvements in\ncountermovement jump height, countermovement jump force production, or YYIR2 performance, tested over the following 2 days. On the other hand, as we have discussed, studies of acute sleep deprivation, especially those measuring technical performance outcomes, tended to yield positive results. Given that sleep is often disrupted the night before athletic competition,66 athletes involved in sports requiring these types of skills are likely to be particularly sensitive to sleep manipulations and thus should be counseled regarding the importance of sleep for game performance. Relatedly, chronic sleep extension studies have demonstrated significant benefits to athletes.35,49 Thus, strategies to improve sleep not only the night before an important sports event but also in the weeks leading up to this event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance. \nPage 1 of 1  \n\n", "system_role": "You are an expert at science communication.", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 1000, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "qna": {"article_title": "The Impact of Sleep Duration on Performance Among Competitive Athletes: A Systematic Literature Review  ", "system_role": "You are an expert at science communication.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "text": "The Impact of Sleep Duration on Performance Among Competitive Athletes: A Systematic Literature Review  \n\nDISCUSSION \nThis literature review, although diverse in the range of sports, methods, and outcomes studied, provides several stylized facts that can inform sleep research and competitive athletes.

First, out of all the published studies we reviewed, none found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome. All of the results reviewed showed that either the increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Note that among studies reporting significant positive results, effect sizes varied considerably (Tables 2-4), likely due to differences in the duration of sleep deprivation/extension experienced as well as differences in outcome measures. Second, when considering the aerobic and anaerobic characteristics of sports, it seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. For instance, Mejri et al40 found that depriving competitive taekwondo boxers of a mere 3 to 4 hours of sleep significantly impaired performance on the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test. By contrast, Blumert et al33 employed a relatively severe sleep deprivation protocol by depriving 9 national-caliber collegiate weightlifters of 24 hours of sleep and yet failed to identify adverse effects on any of the various weightlifting exercises examined. Relatedly, for both endurance and explosive, power-based exercises, it has been well documented that sleep deprivation is associated with increased perceived effort.56\u009658 Still, the relationship between perceived effort and objective performance has not been widely validated and is a topic for future investigation. Third, of the studies that measured outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills, most find benefits of sleep on performance. Tennis serving accuracy and basketball shooting were both improved by long-term sleep extension interventions,35,39 and tennis serving accuracy suffered when players were deprived of 2 to 2.5 hours of sleep at the beginning of the preceding night.37 Regarding studies conducted in players of team sports that incorporated tactics and decision-based outcomes to a broader extent, soccer as well as rugby players exhibited performance deficits after nights of decreased sleep duration.34 These results are in line with other literature demonstrating clear neurocognitive deficits in the setting of inadequate sleep in the general population, reviewed thoroughly elsewhere.59,60 Finally, when looking at the methodologies of the experimental studies, we found that the studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Interestingly although most acute sleep interventions involved sleep deprivation and yielded positive results, there were inconsistent results among the 2 acute sleep extension studies.15,38 Conversely, the majority of longer-term sleep intervention studies involved sleep extension and showed positive results.35,39,49 Taken together, these findings suggest that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. On the other hand, more research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. The reliability and precision of the various measurements may present challenges in interpretation of these studies. For example, \u0093maximal\u0094 voluntary muscle contraction and voluntarily chosen training load are variable across subjects.61,62 On the other hand, \u0093running economy,\u0094 the oxygen cost associated with a given running velocity, has low variability among highly trained runners and is significantly correlated with cardiorespiratory parameters used to assess aerobic capacity.63 A meta-analysis of the reliability of various measures of muscle power previously identified that field running tests tended to be more reliable than treadmill running tests, tests lasting up to 1 minute tended to be more reliable than those lasting greater than 1 minute (likely due to increased variability in muscle movement and limb positioning), and isokinetic tests tended to be more reliable when measuring muscle extension versus flexion.62 Somewhat reassuringly in the context of the present review, this metaanalysis also found that measurements taken from athletes were more reliable than those taken from non-athlete subjects. With respect to the validity of outcome measures reported as performance indicators, the nature of the sport (eg, team vs individual) may be an important determinant of whether what is measured in the laboratory translates to the actual game. For instance, for team-based sports requiring complex game structure such as soccer, measures of muscle force production or running speed are likely insufficient to provide an accurate assessment of in-game performance, although they may be helpful in making gross approximations and predictions.64 Of course, actual performance metrics from real or simulated games would be the ideal outcomes to quantify for such sports in future investigations. More specifically, for performance outcomes included in the current review, the following have been independently validated and shown to be reliable measures of athletic performance: Yo-Yo intermittent recovery (YYIR) test, isometric muscle contraction, squat, countermovement jump, free sthrow basketball shooting, tennis serving, shuttle-running tests, and Wingate test.42\u009648 In Table 1, we have indicated studies employing previously validated and reliable metrics of objective performance with asterisks (as per the criteria discussed above). Still, more work will be required to further validate the various performance outcomes measured in the studies reviewed in the present work, especially those involving complex, team-based measures such as composite game performance scores and passing accuracy. Likewise, given the high inter-individual variability of sleep variables used across the included studies, these metrics will also require further investigation to determine their precision and reliability as predictors of athletic performance. Importantly, we chose to require at least one objective performance measure among our inclusion criteria. The previous work relying on self-perceived performance, although informative in understanding the potential effect of sleep loss or gain on sports psychology,15 may not accurately reflect actual performance, as was the goal of the present work. However, under certain circumstances, self-perceived pre-game wellness (including self-reported sleep quality) may be predictive of objective in-game performance.65 More research will be needed to assess the validity of playerreported performance and objective performance, especially when athletes exhibit compromised sleep. Several experimental studies are particularly illustrative of the various trends in the results we have just outlined. To address the question of whether one night of sleep extension would be sufficient to improve various fitness indices among semi-professional soccer players, Fullagar et al15 tested a sleep hygiene intervention. The investigators implemented a sleep hygiene strategy (SHS) designed to maximize sleep duration and limit stimulation before bedtime to test whether this would be sufficient to improve either anaerobic (jumping height and force production) or aerobic endurance (Yo\u0096Yo intermittent recovery level 2, YYIR2) performance after latenight soccer matches. Implementing a randomized design, they assigned 20 participants to follow either their normal post-match sleep routine [non-SHS (NSHS)] or a SHS involving early dimming of lights and lights out by midnight, cool room temperature, and no technology or light stimulation for 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. Actigraphy was used to measure sleep patterns, and sleep diary was used for subjective recall of sleep quality. Despite finding that those assigned to the SHS indeed exhibited increased sleep duration after the night match relative to those in the NSHS group, the investigators failed to identify any improvements in\ncountermovement jump height, countermovement jump force production, or YYIR2 performance, tested over the following 2 days. On the other hand, as we have discussed, studies of acute sleep deprivation, especially those measuring technical performance outcomes, tended to yield positive results. Given that sleep is often disrupted the night before athletic competition,66 athletes involved in sports requiring these types of skills are likely to be particularly sensitive to sleep manipulations and thus should be counseled regarding the importance of sleep for game performance. Relatedly, chronic sleep extension studies have demonstrated significant benefits to athletes.35,49 Thus, strategies to improve sleep not only the night before an important sports event but also in the weeks leading up to this event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance. \nPage 1 of 1  \n\n", "system_role": "You are an expert at science communication.", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 1000, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "qna": {"article_title": "The Impact of Sleep Duration on Performance Among Competitive Athletes: A Systematic Literature Review  ", "system_role": "You are an expert at science communication.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "text": "The Impact of Sleep Duration on Performance Among Competitive Athletes: A Systematic Literature Review  \n\nDISCUSSION \nThis literature review, although diverse in the range of sports, methods, and outcomes studied, provides several stylized facts that can inform sleep research and competitive athletes.

International Journal of Obesity\n\nDiscussion\nThe present study employed a two-stage research investigation to examine the relationship between weight stigma and several health behaviors in a large sample of U.S. adults. As predicted, weight stigma was significantly associated with greater disordered eating, comfort eating, alcohol use, and sleep disturbance, after controlling for covariates. No such relationship was observed for physical activity.\nTargeting health behaviors (e.g., eating) to achieve weight loss is common in weight-focused health promotion policies. These policies assume that individuals can improve their health by losing weight, employing weight stigma as one strategy for motivating behavior change [5]. However, our findings indicate that weight stigma is associated with poorer health behaviors, independent of BMI. Given that physical health and weight are largely shaped by factors outside of an individual\u0092s control (i.e., genetics and social determinants like socioeconomic status) [5], it is concerning that multiple behaviors, for which individuals have some control over, may be undermined by weight stigma.\nFurthermore, a lower BMI may not necessarily be protective against weight stigma. In our sample, individuals across the weight spectrum, not only those with overweight or obese BMIs, reported weight stigma. In fact, moderation analyses indicated that individuals with\u00a0lower\u00a0BMIs showed greater disordered eating and alcohol use in the face of weight stigma. These results emerged despite individuals with higher weight reporting greater daily weight stigma. One explanation for the observed differences in health behavioral outcomes across the weight spectrum is that infrequent health behaviors may be less likely to be enacted as coping strategies. For instance, previous research has shown that alcohol use decreases as BMI increases among females with higher weight [44]. Thus, using food, instead of alcohol, may be the more common coping strategy among individuals with higher BMIs, as previous research suggests [45]. Nonetheless, the sizes of the moderation effects were very small, with some confidence intervals functionally at zero, and thus further interpretation of the present findings should only be done with caution.\nPrior research has found conflicting evidence for the relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. Some studies have found that greater weight stigma is associated with short-term increases in reported exercise behavior [16,\u00a046]. Others have shown that weight stigma is positively correlated with increased exercise avoidance, but has no direct link to self-reported exercise [14,\u00a047]. The current study adds to the latter base of evidence showing no relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. One possible explanation is that participants were asked about their daily experiences with weight stigma, which may not correspond to their level of physical activity over the past month. Ecological momentary assessment methodology may provide better insight into this relationship, as demonstrated by Vartanian et al. who examined health motivations following stigmatizing events in daily life [48].\nDespite emerging evidence that weight stigma is prevalent among men [28], there is a lack of research on men\u0092s health outcomes related to weight stigma. In this study, moderation by gender was not observed for any outcome. These results are consistent with previous research reporting no gender differences in poor health outcomes such as mortality and obesity due to weight stigma [3,\u00a049]. Men may also feel pressured to meet societal body standards and thus may display the same magnitude of associations between weight stigma and health behaviors. It is recommended that the null gender findings are interpreted with caution, as more research is needed.\nHow might weight stigma influence an individual\u0092s health behaviors? One potential mechanism is stress. Previous work suggests that weight stigma is stressful [6,\u00a050] and experimental lab studies manipulating weight stigma have shown that individuals with higher weight, as well as those who perceive themselves as overweight, show elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol following exposure to a weight-stigmatizing event [51,\u00a052]. Additionally, some research has found that individuals who experience more weight-based discrimination have higher hair cortisol levels\u0097a finding most pronounced in those at the highest BMI [53]. Individuals who experience greater stress may engage in more unhealthy coping behaviors. Indeed, stress can drive changes in behaviors such as eating, physical activity, and sleep [54]. For example, Tataranni et al. administered synthetic cortisol vs. placebo and found greater food consumption in the cortisol group [55]. This early work is supported by accumulating evidence that cortisol is associated with increased caloric intake and greater abdominal fat storage [56]. The health behavior pathway may not be independent from that of stress but rather reflect a serial mediation model, wherein weight stigma increases stress that in turn causes decrements in health behaviors.\nThe present study contributes to the weight stigma literature in several ways. As noted, a key strength of this study is the assessment of several health behaviors within a large, national census-matched sample. Previous studies that have examined weight stigma in relation to different health behaviors have often had small sample sizes or were limited to female subjects. Thus, the present study may provide more generalizable information about health behaviors in the U.S. A related strength of the study is that higher BMI scores were well-represented in the sample, with 31.4% meeting BMI criteria for obesity. This is a closer estimate of the proportion of the American population that is classified with obesity (42%) compared to previous studies [57]. Therefore, there is greater confidence that these findings reflect the experiences of individuals with obesity in the population, aiding generalizability. Lastly, we enhance reproducibility by presenting a two-stage research program of exploratory and confirmatory analyses based on recommended open science practices.\nThere are some limitations to consider. First, a composite weight stigma score was used due to survey constraints. While early tests indicate good construct validity, additional psychometric testing is warranted (see Online Supplementary Materials\u00a04). Another limitation is the use of self-reported weight, which is subject to inaccuracies. Additionally, the data collection period overlapped with winter holidays. Individuals may have made new year\u0092s health resolutions, and therefore the self-reported health behaviors may be more indicative of newly established goals rather than typical health habits. However, such resolutions would likely dampen, rather than magnify, the relationship between weight stigma and poor health behaviors. Lastly, the study is cross-sectional and therefore causal direction cannot be determined. Weight stigma may operate as a feedback loop that leads to weight gain through certain behaviors such as comfort eating [6], but further investigation is required. Given survey constraints, weight bias internalization was not assessed. Future research should build on these findings to determine the potential role of weight bias internalization in these health behaviors.\nDespite these limitations, these study\u0092s findings show that weight stigma is significantly associated with several health behaviors. If future research confirms that this is indeed a causal relationship, weight stigma could cumulatively undermine physical health over time. Taken together, these findings highlight weight stigma as a potential barrier to healthy behaviors, and suggest that one strategy to improve population health may be to reduce weight stigma. Though more research is needed, it may be important to employ more weight-inclusive approaches to health promotion, such as removing stigmatizing language or weight outcomes from health policies and program objectives [5].\n\n", "system_role": "You are an expert at science communication.", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 1000, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "qna": {"article_title": "Weight stigma and health behaviors: evidence from the Eating in America Study. International Journal of Obesity", "system_role": "You are an expert at science communication.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "text": "Weight stigma and health behaviors: evidence from the Eating in America Study. International Journal of Obesity\n\nDiscussion\nThe present study employed a two-stage research investigation to examine the relationship between weight stigma and several health behaviors in a large sample of U.S. adults. As predicted, weight stigma was significantly associated with greater disordered eating, comfort eating, alcohol use, and sleep disturbance, after controlling for covariates. No such relationship was observed for physical activity.\nTargeting health behaviors (e.g., eating) to achieve weight loss is common in weight-focused health promotion policies. These policies assume that individuals can improve their health by losing weight, employing weight stigma as one strategy for motivating behavior change [5]. However, our findings indicate that weight stigma is associated with poorer health behaviors, independent of BMI. Given that physical health and weight are largely shaped by factors outside of an individual\u0092s control (i.e., genetics and social determinants like socioeconomic status) [5], it is concerning that multiple behaviors, for which individuals have some control over, may be undermined by weight stigma.\nFurthermore, a lower BMI may not necessarily be protective against weight stigma. In our sample, individuals across the weight spectrum, not only those with overweight or obese BMIs, reported weight stigma. In fact, moderation analyses indicated that individuals with\u00a0lower\u00a0BMIs showed greater disordered eating and alcohol use in the face of weight stigma. These results emerged despite individuals with higher weight reporting greater daily weight stigma. One explanation for the observed differences in health behavioral outcomes across the weight spectrum is that infrequent health behaviors may be less likely to be enacted as coping strategies. For instance, previous research has shown that alcohol use decreases as BMI increases among females with higher weight [44]. Thus, using food, instead of alcohol, may be the more common coping strategy among individuals with higher BMIs, as previous research suggests [45]. Nonetheless, the sizes of the moderation effects were very small, with some confidence intervals functionally at zero, and thus further interpretation of the present findings should only be done with caution.\nPrior research has found conflicting evidence for the relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. Some studies have found that greater weight stigma is associated with short-term increases in reported exercise behavior [16,\u00a046]. Others have shown that weight stigma is positively correlated with increased exercise avoidance, but has no direct link to self-reported exercise [14,\u00a047]. The current study adds to the latter base of evidence showing no relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. One possible explanation is that participants were asked about their daily experiences with weight stigma, which may not correspond to their level of physical activity over the past month. Ecological momentary assessment methodology may provide better insight into this relationship, as demonstrated by Vartanian et al. who examined health motivations following stigmatizing events in daily life [48].\nDespite emerging evidence that weight stigma is prevalent among men [28], there is a lack of research on men\u0092s health outcomes related to weight stigma. In this study, moderation by gender was not observed for any outcome. These results are consistent with previous research reporting no gender differences in poor health outcomes such as mortality and obesity due to weight stigma [3,\u00a049]. Men may also feel pressured to meet societal body standards and thus may display the same magnitude of associations between weight stigma and health behaviors. It is recommended that the null gender findings are interpreted with caution, as more research is needed.\nHow might weight stigma influence an individual\u0092s health behaviors? One potential mechanism is stress. Previous work suggests that weight stigma is stressful [6,\u00a050] and experimental lab studies manipulating weight stigma have shown that individuals with higher weight, as well as those who perceive themselves as overweight, show elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol following exposure to a weight-stigmatizing event [51,\u00a052]. Additionally, some research has found that individuals who experience more weight-based discrimination have higher hair cortisol levels\u0097a finding most pronounced in those at the highest BMI [53]. Individuals who experience greater stress may engage in more unhealthy coping behaviors. Indeed, stress can drive changes in behaviors such as eating, physical activity, and sleep [54]. For example, Tataranni et al. administered synthetic cortisol vs. placebo and found greater food consumption in the cortisol group [55]. This early work is supported by accumulating evidence that cortisol is associated with increased caloric intake and greater abdominal fat storage [56]. The health behavior pathway may not be independent from that of stress but rather reflect a serial mediation model, wherein weight stigma increases stress that in turn causes decrements in health behaviors.\nThe present study contributes to the weight stigma literature in several ways. As noted, a key strength of this study is the assessment of several health behaviors within a large, national census-matched sample. Previous studies that have examined weight stigma in relation to different health behaviors have often had small sample sizes or were limited to female subjects. Thus, the present study may provide more generalizable information about health behaviors in the U.S. A related strength of the study is that higher BMI scores were well-represented in the sample, with 31.4% meeting BMI criteria for obesity. This is a closer estimate of the proportion of the American population that is classified with obesity (42%) compared to previous studies [57]. Therefore, there is greater confidence that these findings reflect the experiences of individuals with obesity in the population, aiding generalizability. Lastly, we enhance reproducibility by presenting a two-stage research program of exploratory and confirmatory analyses based on recommended open science practices.\nThere are some limitations to consider. First, a composite weight stigma score was used due to survey constraints. While early tests indicate good construct validity, additional psychometric testing is warranted (see Online Supplementary Materials\u00a04). Another limitation is the use of self-reported weight, which is subject to inaccuracies. Additionally, the data collection period overlapped with winter holidays. Individuals may have made new year\u0092s health resolutions, and therefore the self-reported health behaviors may be more indicative of newly established goals rather than typical health habits. However, such resolutions would likely dampen, rather than magnify, the relationship between weight stigma and poor health behaviors. Lastly, the study is cross-sectional and therefore causal direction cannot be determined. Weight stigma may operate as a feedback loop that leads to weight gain through certain behaviors such as comfort eating [6], but further investigation is required. Given survey constraints, weight bias internalization was not assessed. Future research should build on these findings to determine the potential role of weight bias internalization in these health behaviors.\nDespite these limitations, these study\u0092s findings show that weight stigma is significantly associated with several health behaviors. If future research confirms that this is indeed a causal relationship, weight stigma could cumulatively undermine physical health over time. Taken together, these findings highlight weight stigma as a potential barrier to healthy behaviors, and suggest that one strategy to improve population health may be to reduce weight stigma. Though more research is needed, it may be important to employ more weight-inclusive approaches to health promotion, such as removing stigmatizing language or weight outcomes from health policies and program objectives [5].\n\n", "prep step": "Take the key points and numerical descriptors to", "summarization task": "Summarize for a LinkedIn post.", "full summarization task": "Take the key points and numerical descriptors to Summarize for a LinkedIn post.", "summary": ["New research published in the International Journal of Obesity shows that weight stigma is associated with disordered eating, comfort eating, alcohol use, and sleep disturbance, but not physical activity, in a large sample of U.S. adults.

International Journal of Obesity\n\nDiscussion\nThe present study employed a two-stage research investigation to examine the relationship between weight stigma and several health behaviors in a large sample of U.S. adults. As predicted, weight stigma was significantly associated with greater disordered eating, comfort eating, alcohol use, and sleep disturbance, after controlling for covariates. No such relationship was observed for physical activity.\nTargeting health behaviors (e.g., eating) to achieve weight loss is common in weight-focused health promotion policies. These policies assume that individuals can improve their health by losing weight, employing weight stigma as one strategy for motivating behavior change [5]. However, our findings indicate that weight stigma is associated with poorer health behaviors, independent of BMI. Given that physical health and weight are largely shaped by factors outside of an individual\u0092s control (i.e., genetics and social determinants like socioeconomic status) [5], it is concerning that multiple behaviors, for which individuals have some control over, may be undermined by weight stigma.\nFurthermore, a lower BMI may not necessarily be protective against weight stigma. In our sample, individuals across the weight spectrum, not only those with overweight or obese BMIs, reported weight stigma. In fact, moderation analyses indicated that individuals with\u00a0lower\u00a0BMIs showed greater disordered eating and alcohol use in the face of weight stigma. These results emerged despite individuals with higher weight reporting greater daily weight stigma. One explanation for the observed differences in health behavioral outcomes across the weight spectrum is that infrequent health behaviors may be less likely to be enacted as coping strategies. For instance, previous research has shown that alcohol use decreases as BMI increases among females with higher weight [44]. Thus, using food, instead of alcohol, may be the more common coping strategy among individuals with higher BMIs, as previous research suggests [45]. Nonetheless, the sizes of the moderation effects were very small, with some confidence intervals functionally at zero, and thus further interpretation of the present findings should only be done with caution.\nPrior research has found conflicting evidence for the relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. Some studies have found that greater weight stigma is associated with short-term increases in reported exercise behavior [16,\u00a046]. Others have shown that weight stigma is positively correlated with increased exercise avoidance, but has no direct link to self-reported exercise [14,\u00a047]. The current study adds to the latter base of evidence showing no relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. One possible explanation is that participants were asked about their daily experiences with weight stigma, which may not correspond to their level of physical activity over the past month. Ecological momentary assessment methodology may provide better insight into this relationship, as demonstrated by Vartanian et al. who examined health motivations following stigmatizing events in daily life [48].\nDespite emerging evidence that weight stigma is prevalent among men [28], there is a lack of research on men\u0092s health outcomes related to weight stigma. In this study, moderation by gender was not observed for any outcome. These results are consistent with previous research reporting no gender differences in poor health outcomes such as mortality and obesity due to weight stigma [3,\u00a049]. Men may also feel pressured to meet societal body standards and thus may display the same magnitude of associations between weight stigma and health behaviors. It is recommended that the null gender findings are interpreted with caution, as more research is needed.\nHow might weight stigma influence an individual\u0092s health behaviors? One potential mechanism is stress. Previous work suggests that weight stigma is stressful [6,\u00a050] and experimental lab studies manipulating weight stigma have shown that individuals with higher weight, as well as those who perceive themselves as overweight, show elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol following exposure to a weight-stigmatizing event [51,\u00a052]. Additionally, some research has found that individuals who experience more weight-based discrimination have higher hair cortisol levels\u0097a finding most pronounced in those at the highest BMI [53]. Individuals who experience greater stress may engage in more unhealthy coping behaviors. Indeed, stress can drive changes in behaviors such as eating, physical activity, and sleep [54]. For example, Tataranni et al. administered synthetic cortisol vs. placebo and found greater food consumption in the cortisol group [55]. This early work is supported by accumulating evidence that cortisol is associated with increased caloric intake and greater abdominal fat storage [56]. The health behavior pathway may not be independent from that of stress but rather reflect a serial mediation model, wherein weight stigma increases stress that in turn causes decrements in health behaviors.\nThe present study contributes to the weight stigma literature in several ways. As noted, a key strength of this study is the assessment of several health behaviors within a large, national census-matched sample. Previous studies that have examined weight stigma in relation to different health behaviors have often had small sample sizes or were limited to female subjects. Thus, the present study may provide more generalizable information about health behaviors in the U.S. A related strength of the study is that higher BMI scores were well-represented in the sample, with 31.4% meeting BMI criteria for obesity. This is a closer estimate of the proportion of the American population that is classified with obesity (42%) compared to previous studies [57]. Therefore, there is greater confidence that these findings reflect the experiences of individuals with obesity in the population, aiding generalizability. Lastly, we enhance reproducibility by presenting a two-stage research program of exploratory and confirmatory analyses based on recommended open science practices.\nThere are some limitations to consider. First, a composite weight stigma score was used due to survey constraints. While early tests indicate good construct validity, additional psychometric testing is warranted (see Online Supplementary Materials\u00a04). Another limitation is the use of self-reported weight, which is subject to inaccuracies. Additionally, the data collection period overlapped with winter holidays. Individuals may have made new year\u0092s health resolutions, and therefore the self-reported health behaviors may be more indicative of newly established goals rather than typical health habits. However, such resolutions would likely dampen, rather than magnify, the relationship between weight stigma and poor health behaviors. Lastly, the study is cross-sectional and therefore causal direction cannot be determined. Weight stigma may operate as a feedback loop that leads to weight gain through certain behaviors such as comfort eating [6], but further investigation is required. Given survey constraints, weight bias internalization was not assessed. Future research should build on these findings to determine the potential role of weight bias internalization in these health behaviors.\nDespite these limitations, these study\u0092s findings show that weight stigma is significantly associated with several health behaviors. If future research confirms that this is indeed a causal relationship, weight stigma could cumulatively undermine physical health over time. Taken together, these findings highlight weight stigma as a potential barrier to healthy behaviors, and suggest that one strategy to improve population health may be to reduce weight stigma. Though more research is needed, it may be important to employ more weight-inclusive approaches to health promotion, such as removing stigmatizing language or weight outcomes from health policies and program objectives [5].\n\n", "system_role": "You are an expert at science communication.", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 1000, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "qna": {"article_title": "Weight stigma and health behaviors: evidence from the Eating in America Study.

As noted, a key strength of this study is the assessment of several health behaviors within a large, national census-matched sample. Previous studies that have examined weight stigma in relation to different health behaviors have often had small sample sizes or were limited to female subjects. Thus, the present study may provide more generalizable information about health behaviors in the U.S. A related strength of the study is that higher BMI scores were well-represented in the sample, with 31.4% meeting BMI criteria for obesity. This is a closer estimate of the proportion of the American population that is classified with obesity (42%) compared to previous studies [57]. Therefore, there is greater confidence that these findings reflect the experiences of individuals with obesity in the population, aiding generalizability. Lastly, we enhance reproducibility by presenting a two-stage research program of exploratory and confirmatory analyses based on recommended open science practices.\nThere are some limitations to consider. First, a composite weight stigma score was used due to survey constraints. While early tests indicate good construct validity, additional psychometric testing is warranted (see Online Supplementary Materials\u00a04). Another limitation is the use of self-reported weight, which is subject to inaccuracies. Additionally, the data collection period overlapped with winter holidays. Individuals may have made new year\u0092s health resolutions, and therefore the self-reported health behaviors may be more indicative of newly established goals rather than typical health habits. However, such resolutions would likely dampen, rather than magnify, the relationship between weight stigma and poor health behaviors. Lastly, the study is cross-sectional and therefore causal direction cannot be determined. Weight stigma may operate as a feedback loop that leads to weight gain through certain behaviors such as comfort eating [6], but further investigation is required. Given survey constraints, weight bias internalization was not assessed. Future research should build on these findings to determine the potential role of weight bias internalization in these health behaviors.\nDespite these limitations, these study\u0092s findings show that weight stigma is significantly associated with several health behaviors. If future research confirms that this is indeed a causal relationship, weight stigma could cumulatively undermine physical health over time. Taken together, these findings highlight weight stigma as a potential barrier to healthy behaviors, and suggest that one strategy to improve population health may be to reduce weight stigma. Though more research is needed, it may be important to employ more weight-inclusive approaches to health promotion, such as removing stigmatizing language or weight outcomes from health policies and program objectives [5].\n\n", "prep step": "Take the key points and numerical descriptors to", "summarization task": "Describe the interesting points to your coworker at the water cooler", "full summarization task": "Take the key points and numerical descriptors to Describe the interesting points to your coworker at the water cooler", "summary": ["Hey, did you know that weight stigma is associated with poorer health behaviors, regardless of BMI?

International Journal of Obesity\n\nDiscussion\nThe present study employed a two-stage research investigation to examine the relationship between weight stigma and several health behaviors in a large sample of U.S. adults. As predicted, weight stigma was significantly associated with greater disordered eating, comfort eating, alcohol use, and sleep disturbance, after controlling for covariates. No such relationship was observed for physical activity.\nTargeting health behaviors (e.g., eating) to achieve weight loss is common in weight-focused health promotion policies. These policies assume that individuals can improve their health by losing weight, employing weight stigma as one strategy for motivating behavior change [5]. However, our findings indicate that weight stigma is associated with poorer health behaviors, independent of BMI. Given that physical health and weight are largely shaped by factors outside of an individual\u0092s control (i.e., genetics and social determinants like socioeconomic status) [5], it is concerning that multiple behaviors, for which individuals have some control over, may be undermined by weight stigma.\nFurthermore, a lower BMI may not necessarily be protective against weight stigma. In our sample, individuals across the weight spectrum, not only those with overweight or obese BMIs, reported weight stigma. In fact, moderation analyses indicated that individuals with\u00a0lower\u00a0BMIs showed greater disordered eating and alcohol use in the face of weight stigma. These results emerged despite individuals with higher weight reporting greater daily weight stigma. One explanation for the observed differences in health behavioral outcomes across the weight spectrum is that infrequent health behaviors may be less likely to be enacted as coping strategies. For instance, previous research has shown that alcohol use decreases as BMI increases among females with higher weight [44]. Thus, using food, instead of alcohol, may be the more common coping strategy among individuals with higher BMIs, as previous research suggests [45]. Nonetheless, the sizes of the moderation effects were very small, with some confidence intervals functionally at zero, and thus further interpretation of the present findings should only be done with caution.\nPrior research has found conflicting evidence for the relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. Some studies have found that greater weight stigma is associated with short-term increases in reported exercise behavior [16,\u00a046]. Others have shown that weight stigma is positively correlated with increased exercise avoidance, but has no direct link to self-reported exercise [14,\u00a047]. The current study adds to the latter base of evidence showing no relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. One possible explanation is that participants were asked about their daily experiences with weight stigma, which may not correspond to their level of physical activity over the past month. Ecological momentary assessment methodology may provide better insight into this relationship, as demonstrated by Vartanian et al. who examined health motivations following stigmatizing events in daily life [48].\nDespite emerging evidence that weight stigma is prevalent among men [28], there is a lack of research on men\u0092s health outcomes related to weight stigma. In this study, moderation by gender was not observed for any outcome. These results are consistent with previous research reporting no gender differences in poor health outcomes such as mortality and obesity due to weight stigma [3,\u00a049]. Men may also feel pressured to meet societal body standards and thus may display the same magnitude of associations between weight stigma and health behaviors. It is recommended that the null gender findings are interpreted with caution, as more research is needed.\nHow might weight stigma influence an individual\u0092s health behaviors? One potential mechanism is stress. Previous work suggests that weight stigma is stressful [6,\u00a050] and experimental lab studies manipulating weight stigma have shown that individuals with higher weight, as well as those who perceive themselves as overweight, show elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol following exposure to a weight-stigmatizing event [51,\u00a052]. Additionally, some research has found that individuals who experience more weight-based discrimination have higher hair cortisol levels\u0097a finding most pronounced in those at the highest BMI [53]. Individuals who experience greater stress may engage in more unhealthy coping behaviors. Indeed, stress can drive changes in behaviors such as eating, physical activity, and sleep [54]. For example, Tataranni et al. administered synthetic cortisol vs. placebo and found greater food consumption in the cortisol group [55]. This early work is supported by accumulating evidence that cortisol is associated with increased caloric intake and greater abdominal fat storage [56]. The health behavior pathway may not be independent from that of stress but rather reflect a serial mediation model, wherein weight stigma increases stress that in turn causes decrements in health behaviors.\nThe present study contributes to the weight stigma literature in several ways. As noted, a key strength of this study is the assessment of several health behaviors within a large, national census-matched sample. Previous studies that have examined weight stigma in relation to different health behaviors have often had small sample sizes or were limited to female subjects. Thus, the present study may provide more generalizable information about health behaviors in the U.S. A related strength of the study is that higher BMI scores were well-represented in the sample, with 31.4% meeting BMI criteria for obesity. This is a closer estimate of the proportion of the American population that is classified with obesity (42%) compared to previous studies [57]. Therefore, there is greater confidence that these findings reflect the experiences of individuals with obesity in the population, aiding generalizability. Lastly, we enhance reproducibility by presenting a two-stage research program of exploratory and confirmatory analyses based on recommended open science practices.\nThere are some limitations to consider. First, a composite weight stigma score was used due to survey constraints. While early tests indicate good construct validity, additional psychometric testing is warranted (see Online Supplementary Materials\u00a04). Another limitation is the use of self-reported weight, which is subject to inaccuracies. Additionally, the data collection period overlapped with winter holidays. Individuals may have made new year\u0092s health resolutions, and therefore the self-reported health behaviors may be more indicative of newly established goals rather than typical health habits. However, such resolutions would likely dampen, rather than magnify, the relationship between weight stigma and poor health behaviors. Lastly, the study is cross-sectional and therefore causal direction cannot be determined. Weight stigma may operate as a feedback loop that leads to weight gain through certain behaviors such as comfort eating [6], but further investigation is required. Given survey constraints, weight bias internalization was not assessed.

International Journal of Obesity", "system_role": "You are an expert at science communication.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "text": "Weight stigma and health behaviors: evidence from the Eating in America Study. International Journal of Obesity\n\nDiscussion\nThe present study employed a two-stage research investigation to examine the relationship between weight stigma and several health behaviors in a large sample of U.S. adults. As predicted, weight stigma was significantly associated with greater disordered eating, comfort eating, alcohol use, and sleep disturbance, after controlling for covariates. No such relationship was observed for physical activity.\nTargeting health behaviors (e.g., eating) to achieve weight loss is common in weight-focused health promotion policies. These policies assume that individuals can improve their health by losing weight, employing weight stigma as one strategy for motivating behavior change [5]. However, our findings indicate that weight stigma is associated with poorer health behaviors, independent of BMI. Given that physical health and weight are largely shaped by factors outside of an individual\u0092s control (i.e., genetics and social determinants like socioeconomic status) [5], it is concerning that multiple behaviors, for which individuals have some control over, may be undermined by weight stigma.\nFurthermore, a lower BMI may not necessarily be protective against weight stigma. In our sample, individuals across the weight spectrum, not only those with overweight or obese BMIs, reported weight stigma. In fact, moderation analyses indicated that individuals with\u00a0lower\u00a0BMIs showed greater disordered eating and alcohol use in the face of weight stigma. These results emerged despite individuals with higher weight reporting greater daily weight stigma. One explanation for the observed differences in health behavioral outcomes across the weight spectrum is that infrequent health behaviors may be less likely to be enacted as coping strategies. For instance, previous research has shown that alcohol use decreases as BMI increases among females with higher weight [44]. Thus, using food, instead of alcohol, may be the more common coping strategy among individuals with higher BMIs, as previous research suggests [45]. Nonetheless, the sizes of the moderation effects were very small, with some confidence intervals functionally at zero, and thus further interpretation of the present findings should only be done with caution.\nPrior research has found conflicting evidence for the relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. Some studies have found that greater weight stigma is associated with short-term increases in reported exercise behavior [16,\u00a046]. Others have shown that weight stigma is positively correlated with increased exercise avoidance, but has no direct link to self-reported exercise [14,\u00a047]. The current study adds to the latter base of evidence showing no relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. One possible explanation is that participants were asked about their daily experiences with weight stigma, which may not correspond to their level of physical activity over the past month. Ecological momentary assessment methodology may provide better insight into this relationship, as demonstrated by Vartanian et al. who examined health motivations following stigmatizing events in daily life [48].\nDespite emerging evidence that weight stigma is prevalent among men [28], there is a lack of research on men\u0092s health outcomes related to weight stigma. In this study, moderation by gender was not observed for any outcome. These results are consistent with previous research reporting no gender differences in poor health outcomes such as mortality and obesity due to weight stigma [3,\u00a049]. Men may also feel pressured to meet societal body standards and thus may display the same magnitude of associations between weight stigma and health behaviors. It is recommended that the null gender findings are interpreted with caution, as more research is needed.\nHow might weight stigma influence an individual\u0092s health behaviors? One potential mechanism is stress. Previous work suggests that weight stigma is stressful [6,\u00a050] and experimental lab studies manipulating weight stigma have shown that individuals with higher weight, as well as those who perceive themselves as overweight, show elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol following exposure to a weight-stigmatizing event [51,\u00a052]. Additionally, some research has found that individuals who experience more weight-based discrimination have higher hair cortisol levels\u0097a finding most pronounced in those at the highest BMI [53]. Individuals who experience greater stress may engage in more unhealthy coping behaviors. Indeed, stress can drive changes in behaviors such as eating, physical activity, and sleep [54]. For example, Tataranni et al. administered synthetic cortisol vs. placebo and found greater food consumption in the cortisol group [55]. This early work is supported by accumulating evidence that cortisol is associated with increased caloric intake and greater abdominal fat storage [56]. The health behavior pathway may not be independent from that of stress but rather reflect a serial mediation model, wherein weight stigma increases stress that in turn causes decrements in health behaviors.\nThe present study contributes to the weight stigma literature in several ways. As noted, a key strength of this study is the assessment of several health behaviors within a large, national census-matched sample. Previous studies that have examined weight stigma in relation to different health behaviors have often had small sample sizes or were limited to female subjects. Thus, the present study may provide more generalizable information about health behaviors in the U.S. A related strength of the study is that higher BMI scores were well-represented in the sample, with 31.4% meeting BMI criteria for obesity. This is a closer estimate of the proportion of the American population that is classified with obesity (42%) compared to previous studies [57]. Therefore, there is greater confidence that these findings reflect the experiences of individuals with obesity in the population, aiding generalizability. Lastly, we enhance reproducibility by presenting a two-stage research program of exploratory and confirmatory analyses based on recommended open science practices.\nThere are some limitations to consider. First, a composite weight stigma score was used due to survey constraints. While early tests indicate good construct validity, additional psychometric testing is warranted (see Online Supplementary Materials\u00a04). Another limitation is the use of self-reported weight, which is subject to inaccuracies. Additionally, the data collection period overlapped with winter holidays. Individuals may have made new year\u0092s health resolutions, and therefore the self-reported health behaviors may be more indicative of newly established goals rather than typical health habits. However, such resolutions would likely dampen, rather than magnify, the relationship between weight stigma and poor health behaviors. Lastly, the study is cross-sectional and therefore causal direction cannot be determined. Weight stigma may operate as a feedback loop that leads to weight gain through certain behaviors such as comfort eating [6], but further investigation is required. Given survey constraints, weight bias internalization was not assessed. Future research should build on these findings to determine the potential role of weight bias internalization in these health behaviors.\nDespite these limitations, these study\u0092s findings show that weight stigma is significantly associated with several health behaviors. If future research confirms that this is indeed a causal relationship, weight stigma could cumulatively undermine physical health over time. Taken together, these findings highlight weight stigma as a potential barrier to healthy behaviors, and suggest that one strategy to improve population health may be to reduce weight stigma. Though more research is needed, it may be important to employ more weight-inclusive approaches to health promotion, such as removing stigmatizing language or weight outcomes from health policies and program objectives [5].\n\n", "prep step": "Take the key points and numerical descriptors to", "summarization task": "Create an Instagram post without hashtags.", "full summarization task": "Take the key points and numerical descriptors to Create an Instagram post without hashtags.", "summary": ["New research has found that weight stigma is associated with disordered eating, comfort eating, alcohol use, and sleep disturbance, independent of BMI.
