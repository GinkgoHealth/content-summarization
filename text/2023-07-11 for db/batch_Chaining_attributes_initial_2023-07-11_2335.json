{"1_prompt00": {"reference_id": 1, "title": "Comparisons in the Recovery Response From Resistance Exercise Between Young and Middle-Aged Men", "text": "Decreases in muscle mass, function, and neuromuscular activation are significant factors contributing to the decline in the quality of life during the\u00a0aging\u00a0process (21,26). However, the majority of research investigating the effect of\u00a0aging\u00a0has primarily focused on comparing adults older than 60 years with younger adult populations in their second, third, or fourth decade of life (7,16\u009618,25). It seems that only a single study is known that has compared young and middle-aged (40\u009659 years) adults on strength performance and recovery (28). Understanding changes in muscle function as adults move from young to middle-age may provide for a better understanding of how to minimize the significant declines in muscle function as one reaches retirement age.\nChanges in recovery from a bout of exercise may be associated with the\u00a0aging\u00a0process (12). Recovery is often determined by the return of performance measures to baseline (BL) levels or by an attenuation of the inflammatory or\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0response to exercise (15,35). Previous research has reported a decrease in the magnitude of the immune response in older adults (e.g., >65 years) compared with younger adults after maximal graded exercise tests on a treadmill (8) and on an electrically braked cycle ergometer (27). Such a decline may be indicative of a delay in recovery because the inflammatory response is thought to play a major role in muscle remodeling and recovery (37). Decreases in muscle mass and strength associated with\u00a0aging\u00a0have been suggested to impair the recovery process after exercise, by increasing the time to adaptation or muscle repair (7,33). Previously, recovery from resistance exercise has been reported to be impaired in recreationally trained (3\u00966 hours of exercise per week) older adults (?69 years) compared with younger adults (38). Similarly, McLester et al. (28) reported a delay in recovery (e.g., in repetitions performed up to 96 hours after exercise) from a total body resistance exercise program in middle-aged men (56 \u00b1 5 years) compared with younger men (23 \u00b1 5 years). By contrast, other investigations have reported no difference in recovery between younger and older populations when assessing recovery through electrically stimulated muscle contraction (1,23). The differences between these studies are likely related to differences in the mode of exercise, training intensity, and pretraining status (1,23,28,38). Furthermore, only one of these investigations included men with\u00a0resistance training\u00a0experience (28). Considering the differences noted between younger and older adults, examining changes in recovery as one moves from young to older age may provide a better understanding regarding reducing age-associated performance decreases. Therefore, the primary purpose of this investigation was to compare the recovery response between young (18\u009630 years) and middle-aged men (40\u009659 years) from an acute high-volume isokinetic resistance exercise workout. A secondary purpose was to compare the effects of this workout on markers of\u00a0inflammation\u00a0and\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0during the 48-hour recovery period.\nMethods\nExperimental Approach to the Problem\nA parallel study design was used to determine the effects of a single bout of high-volume isokinetic resistance exercise on changes in muscle strength, as well as markers of\u00a0muscle damage, and the inflammatory response between young (18\u009630 years) and middle-aged adults (40\u009659 years). Before data collection, all participants reported to the Human Performance Laboratory (HPL) for anthropometric assessment and familiarization with training and assessment protocols. Participants then returned to the HPL to perform a high-volume resistance exercise protocol. Testing was performed before and immediately after the\u00a0resistance training\u00a0protocol. Recovery assessments (both performance,\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0and inflammatory) were also assessed at 24 and 48 hours after exercise.\nSubjects\nNineteen recreationally trained men volunteered to participate in this investigation. Study participants were recruited and placed into 2 groups based on age. The young adult (YA) group consisted of men between the ages of 18\u009630 years, whereas the middle-aged (MA) group consisted of men between the ages of 40\u009659 years. None of the participants were competitive athletes, and all were recreationally resistance-trained at study enrollment. Inclusion criteria required participants to meet the age requirements of one of the groups and be recreationally active, including\u00a0resistance training\u00a0for the previous 6 months before enrollment as defined by the American College of Sports Medicine (150 minutes of exercise per week) (14). All participants were free of any physical limitations that may have affected performance and were not using any medications, dietary supplements, or any other performance-enhancing drugs before or during the study as determined by a health and activity questionnaire. After an explanation of all procedures, risks, and benefits, each participant gave his written informed consent before participation in this study. The Institutional Review Board of the University of Central Florida approved the research protocol. Experimental group characteristics are presented in\u00a0Table 1.\nProcedures\nBoth groups reported to the HPL on 4 separate occasions. On the first visit (D1), participants reported to the HPL after a 2-hour fast. Anthropometric assessments were performed and included height, body mass, and body composition. After anthropometric assessments, participants performed a standardized warm-up consisting of 5 minutes of pedaling on a cycle ergometer at 50 watts. After the warm-up, participants completed a familiarization protocol on the isokinetic device (S4; Biodex Medical System, Inc., New York, NY, USA). On the second visit (D2), participants arrived after a 10-hour fast and recorded their subjective levels of pain and soreness on a visual analog scale (VAS). There were at least 48 hours between the first and second visits, with no more than 7 days between these 2 visits. After the VAS, participants then provided a BL blood sample followed by an ultrasound (US) assessment of the vastus lateralis (VL) of their right leg. Participants then performed the first lower-body performance assessment protocol (BL). After a 5-minute rest period, participants completed the high-volume isokinetic resistance exercise protocol (HVP), followed immediately post (IP) by another lower-body performance assessment protocol. Blood samples were obtained at IP, 30 (30P), 60 (60P), and 120 minutes (120P) after the exercise protocol. Ultrasound assessments were obtained at IP and 120P, whereas an additional VAS assessment was completed at 30P. Participants reported to the HPL 24 (24 H) and 48 hours (48 H) after D2 for lower-body assessments. In addition, blood draws, US, and VAS measures were also obtained. The order of lower-body assessment, VAS, blood draw, and US measures were the same for all testing sessions.\u00a0Figure 1\u00a0displays the study procedures and timeline.\nDietary Recall\nAll participants provided a 3-day dietary recall beginning the day before D2 testing until the morning of 48 H testing. Participants were asked to maintain their regular diet for the duration of the investigation. FoodWorks nutrient analysis software (McGraw-Hill, New York, NY, USA) was used to analyze the self-reported dietary recalls for total kilocalorie intake and macronutrient distributions (carbohydrate, protein, and fat).\nAnthropometric Assessment\nBody mass (\u00b10.1 kg) and height (\u00b10.1 cm) were measured using a Health-o-meter Professional scale (Patient Weighing Scale, Model 500 KL; Pelstar, Alsip, IL, USA). Body composition was assessed using a multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analyzer (InBody 770; Cerritos, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's guidelines.\nVisual Analog Scale\nParticipants were instructed to assess their subjective feelings of pain and soreness using a 100-mm VAS (23). Participants were asked to rate pain and soreness intensity by placing a mark on a horizontal 100-mm VAS (5,29). Verbal anchors were used at each end of the scale representing no pain or soreness and the worst possible soreness or pain. The VAS was performed at BL, IP, 30P, 24 H, and 48 H.\nUltrasound Assessments\nAll US assessments were performed on the VL of the right leg as previously described (39). Participants were asked to lay supine on an examination table with both legs fully extended for a minimum of 5 minutes to allow fluid shifts to occur (2). Before image collection, all anatomical locations of interest were identified using standardized landmarks for the VL muscle. The length of the VL encompassed the distance from the lateral condyle of the tibia to the most prominent point of the greater trochanter of the femur. The VL measurement required the participant to lay on their side, whereas cross-sectional area (CSA) and muscle thickness (MT) measurements were obtained from the US. The sampling location was determined by the point of intersection between the VL and 50% of the straight-line distance between the greater trochanter and the lateral epicondyle of the femur (39). After determining the desired anatomical position, a linear probe coated with transmission gel was positioned on the surface of the skin to collect the US image. For all US measurements, a 12 MHz probe (LOGIQ P5; General Electric, Wauwatosa, WI, USA) coated with water-soluble transmission gel (Aquasonic 100; Parker Laboratories, Inc., Fairfield, NJ, USA) was passed over the surface of the thigh at the predetermined anatomical locations outlined above. The depth was set at 6.0 cm, gain at 50 dB, and dynamic range at 72. Further analysis of US images was performed offline using image analysis software (ImageJ, version 1.45 s) available from the National Institutes of Health (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). All US images were obtained and analyzed by the same technician. Test-related reliability for all US measurements was determined by using 10 different subjects (not participants from this study) examined 24\u009648 hours apart. Intraclass correlation coefficients and minimal differences (MD) were determined for CSA (R\u00a0= 0.99; MD = 0.85 cm2) and MT (R\u00a0= 0.97; MD = 0.09 cm).\nIsokinetic Assessment Protocol\nThe isokinetic assessment protocol was performed at BL, IP, 120P, 24 H, and 48 H to quantify performance decrements and recovery as a result of the HVP. Participants were seated in the isokinetic dynamometer (S4; Biodex Medical System, Inc.), positioned with a hip angle of 110\u00b0 and strapped into the chair at the waist, shoulders, and across the thigh. Chair and dynamometer settings were adjusted for each participant to correctly align the axis of rotation with the lateral condyle of the femur. All participants were tested on their right leg, which was secured to the dynamometer arm just above the medial and lateral malleoli. The lever arm of the dynamometer was programmed to extend the participant's leg to 155\u00b0 of knee flexion (where 180\u00b0 is a full extension) and flex the participant's leg to 85 degrees of flexion. Isokinetic dynamometer settings for each individual were recorded and remained consistent throughout the study. The isokinetic assessment protocol at each time point consisted of 2 maximal voluntary isometric contractions performed at a 70\u00b0 angle, 1 set of 3 repetitions of concentric knee extension at 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0with passive knee flexion to starting position, and 1 set of 3 repetitions of concentric knee extension at 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0with a passive knee flexion to starting position. Of the 3 maximal repetitions, the highest peak torque (PKT) and average torque (AVGT) were recorded for each speed.\nHigh-Volume Isokinetic Resistance Exercise Protocol\nAfter the isokinetic assessment protocol at BL on D2, the participant remained seated, and the HVP was performed. The HVP consisted of 8 sets of 10 repetitions of concentric knee extension and eccentric knee flexion at 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1. A 1-minute rest interval was provided between each set. Participants were encouraged to provide maximal effort throughout the HVP. Work performed in each set of the HVP was calculated as the product of the mean power of each kick over the time to complete the kick. Total work done was calculated as the sum of the work performed in each of the 8 sets of 10 repetitions during the HVP.\nBlood Collection\nBlood samples were obtained at 7 time points throughout the study (BL, IP, 30P, 60P, 120P, 24 H, and 48 H). The BL, IP, 30P, 60P, and 120P blood samples were obtained using a Teflon cannula placed in a superficial forearm vein using a 3-way stopcock with a male luer lock adapter and a plastic syringe after arrival to the HPL on D2. The cannula was maintained patent using a nonheparinized isotonic saline solution (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). All blood samples were obtained after a 15-minute equilibration period with the exception of the IP blood draw. During the remaining time points (24 H and 48 H), blood was obtained by a single-use disposable needle with the participant lying in a supine position for at least 15 minutes before sampling. Blood draws during 24 H and 48 H were obtained after a 10-hour fast. A total of 20 ml of whole blood was collected at each time point in serum and K2EDTA-treated Vacutainer tubes, (Becton Dickinson). Blood in the K2EDTA tubes was immediately centrifuged at 4,000g\u00a0for 15 minutes, then placed into 1.8-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and frozen at ?80\u00b0 C for later analysis. Blood in the serum tubes was allowed to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes and then subsequently centrifuged, aliquoted, and stored through the same procedure.\nBiochemical Analyses\nSerum concentrations of creatine kinase (CK) were analyzed with the use of a commercially available kinetic assay kit (Sekisui Diagnostics, Charlottetown, PE, Canada) as per manufacturer's instructions. C-reactive protein (CRP) and myoglobin (Mb) concentrations were obtained through commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (CRP; R&D Systems; Minneapolis, MN, USA) (Mb: Calbiotech, Spring Valley, CA, USA), whereas interleukin-6 (IL-6) was obtained through high-sensitivity multiplex assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). To eliminate interassay variability, all samples for a particular assay were thawed once and analyzed by the same technician using a BioTek Eon spectrophotometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT). All samples were analyzed in duplicate with a mean coefficient of variation of 4.50% for CK, 7.38% for CRP, 3.55% for IL-6, and 5.03% for Mb. All biochemical assays were run as per the manufacturer's instructions.\nStatistical Analyses\nPerformance measures were analyzed through repeated measures analysis of covariance to control for BL differences between the groups. Changes in subjective levels of pain and soreness, as well as markers of\u00a0inflammation\u00a0and\u00a0muscle damage, were analyzed through repeated measures analysis of variance. In the event of a significant\u00a0F\u00a0value, least significant difference post hoc tests were used for pairwise comparison. Baseline performance comparisons of both groups were determined by independent t-tests. Outliers were identified when values exceeded 1.5 times the interquartile range (3). For all analyses, a criterion alpha level of ? ? 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Data were analyzed using SPSS v23 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All data are reported as a mean \u00b1\u00a0SD.\nResults\nPerformance Measures\nIsometric Assessments\nUnadjusted isometric performance measures are depicted in\u00a0Table 2. One participant from YA was identified as an outlier and removed from all study analyses. Baseline comparisons between YA and MA revealed that YA had significantly greater AVGT (p\u00a0= 0.043), rate of torque development at 200 ms (RTD200) (p\u00a0= 0.033), and a trend toward a greater isometric PKT (p\u00a0= 0.057) during the isometric assessment than MA. After controlling for BL, examination of the recovery response from the HVP revealed no significant group \u00d7 time interactions for PKT (F\u00a0= 1.009;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.377), AVGT (F\u00a0= 0.997;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.402), or for RTD200 (F\u00a0= 0.225;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.879). There were also no significant main effects of time for PKT (F\u00a0= 0.281;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.759), AVGT (F\u00a0= 0.289;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.833), or RTD200 (F\u00a0= 0.073;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.974).\nIsokinetic Assessment\nUnadjusted isokinetic performance measures are depicted in\u00a0Table 2. No significant differences at BL were noted between the groups; however, a trend toward a greater PKT at both 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.081;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.061) and 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 1.562;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.083) was observed for YA compared with MA. After controlling for BL, no significant group \u00d7 time interactions were observed for PKT at either 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.681;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.503) or 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.450;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.656). In addition, there were no significant main effects for time observed for PKT at either 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.272;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.746) or 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.109;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.910) for both groups combined.\nNo significant difference at BL was found for AVGT at 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.940;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.148), but a trend toward a greater AVGT was noted in YA at 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.008;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.094). When controlling for BL, no significant group \u00d7 time interactions were observed for AVGT at 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.897;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.404) or 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.769;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.484). In addition, no significant main effects for time were noted for AVGT at either 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.228;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.762) or 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.155;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.878).\nBlood Analyses\nChanges in CK and Mb can be found in\u00a0Figures 2\u00a0and\u00a03, respectively, whereas changes in CRP and IL-6 can be observed in\u00a0Figures 4\u00a0and\u00a05, respectively. No significant group \u00d7 time interactions were observed for Mb (F\u00a0= 0.307;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.640), CK (F\u00a0= 0.607;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.551), CRP (F\u00a0= 0.320;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.602), or IL-6 (F\u00a0= 0.466;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.589). However, significant main effects for time were observed for both Mb (F\u00a0= 8.708;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.005) and CK (F\u00a0= 8.127;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.001). Myoglobin was significantly higher at 30P (p\u00a0= 0.002), 60P (p\u00a0= 0.001), and 120P (p\u00a0= 0.007) compared with BL, whereas CK concentrations at 24 H (p\u00a0= 0.002) and 48 H (p\u00a0= 0.006) were significantly higher than BL. Although no significant main effect for time was observed for CRP (F\u00a0= 3.042;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.097), a significant main effect was noted for IL-6 (F\u00a0= 3.689;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.05). Changes in IL-6 were significantly elevated from BL at 30P (p\u00a0= 0.032), 120P (p\u00a0= 0.002), 24 H (p\u00a0= 0.007), and 48 H (p\u00a0= 0.034) for both groups combined.\nVisual Analog Scales\nChanges in subjective feelings of pain and soreness can be observed in\u00a0Table 3. No significant group \u00d7 time interactions were observed for subjective measures of pain (F\u00a0= 0.102;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.959) or soreness (F\u00a0= 0.886;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.455). No significant main effect for time was observed for subjective levels of pain (F\u00a0= 1.085;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.351); however, a significant main effect for time was observed for subjective levels of muscle soreness (F\u00a0= 7.319;\u00a0p\u00a0= < 0.001) in both groups combined. Muscle soreness was significantly higher at 30P (p\u00a0= 0.001), 24 H (p\u00a0= 0.001), and 48 H (p\u00a0= 0.002) compared with BL.\nUltrasound Assessment\nChanges in muscle CSA and MT can be observed in\u00a0Table 3. No significant group \u00d7 time interactions were observed for muscle CSA (F\u00a0= 0.246;\u00a0p\u00a00.747) or MT (F\u00a0= 0.687;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.530). However, a significant main effect for time was observed for both CSA (F\u00a0= 13.460;\u00a0p\u00a0< 0.001) and MT (F\u00a0= 3.685;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.028). Muscle CSA and MT were significantly greater at IP (p\u00a0< 0.001) compared with BL.\nDiscussion\nResults of this study indicated no differences in the recovery response between YA and MA for any of the performance measures, nor in subjective levels of muscle pain or soreness. Furthermore, no between-group differences were observed in the inflammatory or\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0response to the exercise protocol. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine differences in the recovery response from high-volume resistance exercise between recreationally trained young and middle-aged adults. Our results comparing BL performance measures seem to be in agreement with other investigations, demonstrating differences in strength measures between young (23\u009629 years) and older adults (60\u009665 years) (7,15,24), and between middle-aged (41\u009642 years) and older adults (70\u009672 years) (17,18). It does seem that the decline in strength may develop during middle age. However, recovery from exercise seems to be comparable in both younger and middle-aged adults as reflected by similar changes in performance and markers of\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0and\u00a0inflammation. Although changes in strength may occur in middle age, recovery from exercise does seem to be maintained in recreationally trained individuals.\nThe differences observed at BL in isometric force and the rate of force development is consistent with other investigations comparing younger and older adults (16,19,36). Although differences in age between young and middle-aged adults do seem to affect BL levels of strength, it does not seem to affect recovery from exercise. This is supported by similar patterns of\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0and\u00a0inflammation\u00a0observed during the recovery period after the HVP. Elevations in Mb and CK concentrations are consistent with the expected physiological response from a bout of resistance exercise (9,34). These results also suggest that middle-aged recreationally active men who regularly engage in\u00a0resistance training\u00a0do not seem to be at increased risk for greater soreness or\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0in comparison with younger recreationally trained men.\nSimilar response patterns were also noted in the inflammatory response for both groups. No significant elevations from BL were observed in CRP. However, significant increases in IL-6 concentrations were observed for both groups. Although CRP is an acute phase protein whose function is to activate the innate immune response and enhance phagocytosis (10), it does not seem to change after an acute bout of resistance exercise (6). Previous research has reported no significant changes in CRP concentrations after\u00a0resistance training\u00a0protocols recruiting primarily both upper-body (31) and lower-body exercises (4) in younger men. Furthermore, previous investigations have also indicated that training experience can reduce the CRP response to an acute bout of exercise (22,35). Considering that participants in both YA and MA were recreationally trained, it is likely that this training experience may have attenuated the CRP response. Physiologically, it is consistent with the lower stress and damage that occurs with repetitive training (9,35). Interleukin-6 is an inflammatory cytokine that facilitates communication for the mobilization, proliferation, and differentiation of immune cells to the site of tissue damage (6) and has been shown to increase after exercise (11). Elevations in IL-6 are related to the intensity, duration, and mode of training (11,13,32), but the literature is inconclusive regarding the IL-6 response to\u00a0resistance training. A recent study reported that a bout of high-volume resistance exercise (8 sets of 10 repetitions with 70% of maximal strength in the squat exercise) resulted in a significant elevation in IL-6 concentrations 30 min after exercise, but no changes were observed after a bout of high-intensity resistance exercise (8 sets of 3 repetitions with 90% of maximal strength in the squat exercise) in experienced, trained lifters (4). The IL-6 response observed during this investigation as a result of a bout of high-volume resistance exercise seems to be consistent with that recently reported by Bartolomei et al. (4). However, age did not seem to exacerbate nor attenuate the IL-6 response in recreationally trained participants.\nNo differences were noted in the inflammatory or\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0response between YA and MA. As discussed earlier, this is likely related to the recreational training background of the participants. However, there were several limitations to the study that need to be acknowledged. The exercise protocol was performed on an isokinetic dynamometer, which may not have as much practical application as most\u00a0resistance training\u00a0programs use dynamic constant resistance exercises. In addition, unilateral, single-joint exercise recruited a relatively smaller muscle mass than is commonly used in most training programs. The use of this modality of exercise, which has been demonstrated to be very effective in eliciting\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0(20,30), may not have been sufficient to elicit significant performance and inflammatory changes in these recreationally trained participants. Future research should examine modes of training specific to the typical training program of the participants.\nPractical Applications\nThe results of this study indicate that changes in muscle performance seem to begin during middle age, even in recreationally trained individuals. However, participating in recreational\u00a0resistance training\u00a0may mitigate any alteration in the recovery response from exercise. These results should be examined in the context that recovery was investigated after a unilateral, single-joint isokinetic exercise protocol. Although this method has been previously used as an effective mode of exercise to elicit\u00a0muscle damage, it is not specific to the type of exercises typically used by recreational lifters. Future studies may wish to compare these population groups using multijoint, dynamic constant resistance exercises common to the training programs of most recreational lifters, regardless of age.", "folder": "text/2023-07-11 for db", "system_role": "You are a helpful assistant.", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 1000, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613", "qna": {"timestamp": "2023-07-11 23:35:24.458418-07:00", "reference_id": 1, "article_title": "Comparisons in the Recovery Response From Resistance Exercise Between Young and Middle-Aged Men", "text": "Decreases in muscle mass, function, and neuromuscular activation are significant factors contributing to the decline in the quality of life during the\u00a0aging\u00a0process (21,26).

It seems that only a single study is known that has compared young and middle-aged (40\u009659 years) adults on strength performance and recovery (28). Understanding changes in muscle function as adults move from young to middle-age may provide for a better understanding of how to minimize the significant declines in muscle function as one reaches retirement age.\nChanges in recovery from a bout of exercise may be associated with the\u00a0aging\u00a0process (12). Recovery is often determined by the return of performance measures to baseline (BL) levels or by an attenuation of the inflammatory or\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0response to exercise (15,35). Previous research has reported a decrease in the magnitude of the immune response in older adults (e.g., >65 years) compared with younger adults after maximal graded exercise tests on a treadmill (8) and on an electrically braked cycle ergometer (27). Such a decline may be indicative of a delay in recovery because the inflammatory response is thought to play a major role in muscle remodeling and recovery (37). Decreases in muscle mass and strength associated with\u00a0aging\u00a0have been suggested to impair the recovery process after exercise, by increasing the time to adaptation or muscle repair (7,33). Previously, recovery from resistance exercise has been reported to be impaired in recreationally trained (3\u00966 hours of exercise per week) older adults (?69 years) compared with younger adults (38). Similarly, McLester et al. (28) reported a delay in recovery (e.g., in repetitions performed up to 96 hours after exercise) from a total body resistance exercise program in middle-aged men (56 \u00b1 5 years) compared with younger men (23 \u00b1 5 years). By contrast, other investigations have reported no difference in recovery between younger and older populations when assessing recovery through electrically stimulated muscle contraction (1,23). The differences between these studies are likely related to differences in the mode of exercise, training intensity, and pretraining status (1,23,28,38). Furthermore, only one of these investigations included men with\u00a0resistance training\u00a0experience (28). Considering the differences noted between younger and older adults, examining changes in recovery as one moves from young to older age may provide a better understanding regarding reducing age-associated performance decreases. Therefore, the primary purpose of this investigation was to compare the recovery response between young (18\u009630 years) and middle-aged men (40\u009659 years) from an acute high-volume isokinetic resistance exercise workout. A secondary purpose was to compare the effects of this workout on markers of\u00a0inflammation\u00a0and\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0during the 48-hour recovery period.\nMethods\nExperimental Approach to the Problem\nA parallel study design was used to determine the effects of a single bout of high-volume isokinetic resistance exercise on changes in muscle strength, as well as markers of\u00a0muscle damage, and the inflammatory response between young (18\u009630 years) and middle-aged adults (40\u009659 years). Before data collection, all participants reported to the Human Performance Laboratory (HPL) for anthropometric assessment and familiarization with training and assessment protocols. Participants then returned to the HPL to perform a high-volume resistance exercise protocol. Testing was performed before and immediately after the\u00a0resistance training\u00a0protocol. Recovery assessments (both performance,\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0and inflammatory) were also assessed at 24 and 48 hours after exercise.\nSubjects\nNineteen recreationally trained men volunteered to participate in this investigation. Study participants were recruited and placed into 2 groups based on age. The young adult (YA) group consisted of men between the ages of 18\u009630 years, whereas the middle-aged (MA) group consisted of men between the ages of 40\u009659 years. None of the participants were competitive athletes, and all were recreationally resistance-trained at study enrollment. Inclusion criteria required participants to meet the age requirements of one of the groups and be recreationally active, including\u00a0resistance training\u00a0for the previous 6 months before enrollment as defined by the American College of Sports Medicine (150 minutes of exercise per week) (14). All participants were free of any physical limitations that may have affected performance and were not using any medications, dietary supplements, or any other performance-enhancing drugs before or during the study as determined by a health and activity questionnaire. After an explanation of all procedures, risks, and benefits, each participant gave his written informed consent before participation in this study. The Institutional Review Board of the University of Central Florida approved the research protocol. Experimental group characteristics are presented in\u00a0Table 1.\nProcedures\nBoth groups reported to the HPL on 4 separate occasions. On the first visit (D1), participants reported to the HPL after a 2-hour fast. Anthropometric assessments were performed and included height, body mass, and body composition. After anthropometric assessments, participants performed a standardized warm-up consisting of 5 minutes of pedaling on a cycle ergometer at 50 watts. After the warm-up, participants completed a familiarization protocol on the isokinetic device (S4; Biodex Medical System, Inc., New York, NY, USA). On the second visit (D2), participants arrived after a 10-hour fast and recorded their subjective levels of pain and soreness on a visual analog scale (VAS). There were at least 48 hours between the first and second visits, with no more than 7 days between these 2 visits. After the VAS, participants then provided a BL blood sample followed by an ultrasound (US) assessment of the vastus lateralis (VL) of their right leg. Participants then performed the first lower-body performance assessment protocol (BL). After a 5-minute rest period, participants completed the high-volume isokinetic resistance exercise protocol (HVP), followed immediately post (IP) by another lower-body performance assessment protocol. Blood samples were obtained at IP, 30 (30P), 60 (60P), and 120 minutes (120P) after the exercise protocol. Ultrasound assessments were obtained at IP and 120P, whereas an additional VAS assessment was completed at 30P. Participants reported to the HPL 24 (24 H) and 48 hours (48 H) after D2 for lower-body assessments. In addition, blood draws, US, and VAS measures were also obtained. The order of lower-body assessment, VAS, blood draw, and US measures were the same for all testing sessions.\u00a0Figure 1\u00a0displays the study procedures and timeline.\nDietary Recall\nAll participants provided a 3-day dietary recall beginning the day before D2 testing until the morning of 48 H testing. Participants were asked to maintain their regular diet for the duration of the investigation. FoodWorks nutrient analysis software (McGraw-Hill, New York, NY, USA) was used to analyze the self-reported dietary recalls for total kilocalorie intake and macronutrient distributions (carbohydrate, protein, and fat).\nAnthropometric Assessment\nBody mass (\u00b10.1 kg) and height (\u00b10.1 cm) were measured using a Health-o-meter Professional scale (Patient Weighing Scale, Model 500 KL; Pelstar, Alsip, IL, USA). Body composition was assessed using a multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analyzer (InBody 770; Cerritos, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's guidelines.\nVisual Analog Scale\nParticipants were instructed to assess their subjective feelings of pain and soreness using a 100-mm VAS (23). Participants were asked to rate pain and soreness intensity by placing a mark on a horizontal 100-mm VAS (5,29). Verbal anchors were used at each end of the scale representing no pain or soreness and the worst possible soreness or pain. The VAS was performed at BL, IP, 30P, 24 H, and 48 H.\nUltrasound Assessments\nAll US assessments were performed on the VL of the right leg as previously described (39). Participants were asked to lay supine on an examination table with both legs fully extended for a minimum of 5 minutes to allow fluid shifts to occur (2). Before image collection, all anatomical locations of interest were identified using standardized landmarks for the VL muscle. The length of the VL encompassed the distance from the lateral condyle of the tibia to the most prominent point of the greater trochanter of the femur. The VL measurement required the participant to lay on their side, whereas cross-sectional area (CSA) and muscle thickness (MT) measurements were obtained from the US. The sampling location was determined by the point of intersection between the VL and 50% of the straight-line distance between the greater trochanter and the lateral epicondyle of the femur (39). After determining the desired anatomical position, a linear probe coated with transmission gel was positioned on the surface of the skin to collect the US image. For all US measurements, a 12 MHz probe (LOGIQ P5; General Electric, Wauwatosa, WI, USA) coated with water-soluble transmission gel (Aquasonic 100; Parker Laboratories, Inc., Fairfield, NJ, USA) was passed over the surface of the thigh at the predetermined anatomical locations outlined above. The depth was set at 6.0 cm, gain at 50 dB, and dynamic range at 72. Further analysis of US images was performed offline using image analysis software (ImageJ, version 1.45 s) available from the National Institutes of Health (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). All US images were obtained and analyzed by the same technician. Test-related reliability for all US measurements was determined by using 10 different subjects (not participants from this study) examined 24\u009648 hours apart. Intraclass correlation coefficients and minimal differences (MD) were determined for CSA (R\u00a0= 0.99; MD = 0.85 cm2) and MT (R\u00a0= 0.97; MD = 0.09 cm).\nIsokinetic Assessment Protocol\nThe isokinetic assessment protocol was performed at BL, IP, 120P, 24 H, and 48 H to quantify performance decrements and recovery as a result of the HVP. Participants were seated in the isokinetic dynamometer (S4; Biodex Medical System, Inc.), positioned with a hip angle of 110\u00b0 and strapped into the chair at the waist, shoulders, and across the thigh. Chair and dynamometer settings were adjusted for each participant to correctly align the axis of rotation with the lateral condyle of the femur. All participants were tested on their right leg, which was secured to the dynamometer arm just above the medial and lateral malleoli. The lever arm of the dynamometer was programmed to extend the participant's leg to 155\u00b0 of knee flexion (where 180\u00b0 is a full extension) and flex the participant's leg to 85 degrees of flexion. Isokinetic dynamometer settings for each individual were recorded and remained consistent throughout the study. The isokinetic assessment protocol at each time point consisted of 2 maximal voluntary isometric contractions performed at a 70\u00b0 angle, 1 set of 3 repetitions of concentric knee extension at 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0with passive knee flexion to starting position, and 1 set of 3 repetitions of concentric knee extension at 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0with a passive knee flexion to starting position. Of the 3 maximal repetitions, the highest peak torque (PKT) and average torque (AVGT) were recorded for each speed.\nHigh-Volume Isokinetic Resistance Exercise Protocol\nAfter the isokinetic assessment protocol at BL on D2, the participant remained seated, and the HVP was performed. The HVP consisted of 8 sets of 10 repetitions of concentric knee extension and eccentric knee flexion at 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1. A 1-minute rest interval was provided between each set. Participants were encouraged to provide maximal effort throughout the HVP. Work performed in each set of the HVP was calculated as the product of the mean power of each kick over the time to complete the kick. Total work done was calculated as the sum of the work performed in each of the 8 sets of 10 repetitions during the HVP.\nBlood Collection\nBlood samples were obtained at 7 time points throughout the study (BL, IP, 30P, 60P, 120P, 24 H, and 48 H). The BL, IP, 30P, 60P, and 120P blood samples were obtained using a Teflon cannula placed in a superficial forearm vein using a 3-way stopcock with a male luer lock adapter and a plastic syringe after arrival to the HPL on D2. The cannula was maintained patent using a nonheparinized isotonic saline solution (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). All blood samples were obtained after a 15-minute equilibration period with the exception of the IP blood draw. During the remaining time points (24 H and 48 H), blood was obtained by a single-use disposable needle with the participant lying in a supine position for at least 15 minutes before sampling. Blood draws during 24 H and 48 H were obtained after a 10-hour fast. A total of 20 ml of whole blood was collected at each time point in serum and K2EDTA-treated Vacutainer tubes, (Becton Dickinson). Blood in the K2EDTA tubes was immediately centrifuged at 4,000g\u00a0for 15 minutes, then placed into 1.8-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and frozen at ?80\u00b0 C for later analysis. Blood in the serum tubes was allowed to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes and then subsequently centrifuged, aliquoted, and stored through the same procedure.\nBiochemical Analyses\nSerum concentrations of creatine kinase (CK) were analyzed with the use of a commercially available kinetic assay kit (Sekisui Diagnostics, Charlottetown, PE, Canada) as per manufacturer's instructions. C-reactive protein (CRP) and myoglobin (Mb) concentrations were obtained through commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (CRP; R&D Systems; Minneapolis, MN, USA) (Mb: Calbiotech, Spring Valley, CA, USA), whereas interleukin-6 (IL-6) was obtained through high-sensitivity multiplex assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). To eliminate interassay variability, all samples for a particular assay were thawed once and analyzed by the same technician using a BioTek Eon spectrophotometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT). All samples were analyzed in duplicate with a mean coefficient of variation of 4.50% for CK, 7.38% for CRP, 3.55% for IL-6, and 5.03% for Mb. All biochemical assays were run as per the manufacturer's instructions.\nStatistical Analyses\nPerformance measures were analyzed through repeated measures analysis of covariance to control for BL differences between the groups. Changes in subjective levels of pain and soreness, as well as markers of\u00a0inflammation\u00a0and\u00a0muscle damage, were analyzed through repeated measures analysis of variance. In the event of a significant\u00a0F\u00a0value, least significant difference post hoc tests were used for pairwise comparison. Baseline performance comparisons of both groups were determined by independent t-tests. Outliers were identified when values exceeded 1.5 times the interquartile range (3). For all analyses, a criterion alpha level of ? ? 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Data were analyzed using SPSS v23 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All data are reported as a mean \u00b1\u00a0SD.\nResults\nPerformance Measures\nIsometric Assessments\nUnadjusted isometric performance measures are depicted in\u00a0Table 2. One participant from YA was identified as an outlier and removed from all study analyses. Baseline comparisons between YA and MA revealed that YA had significantly greater AVGT (p\u00a0= 0.043), rate of torque development at 200 ms (RTD200) (p\u00a0= 0.033), and a trend toward a greater isometric PKT (p\u00a0= 0.057) during the isometric assessment than MA. After controlling for BL, examination of the recovery response from the HVP revealed no significant group \u00d7 time interactions for PKT (F\u00a0= 1.009;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.377), AVGT (F\u00a0= 0.997;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.402), or for RTD200 (F\u00a0= 0.225;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.879). There were also no significant main effects of time for PKT (F\u00a0= 0.281;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.759), AVGT (F\u00a0= 0.289;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.833), or RTD200 (F\u00a0= 0.073;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.974).\nIsokinetic Assessment\nUnadjusted isokinetic performance measures are depicted in\u00a0Table 2. No significant differences at BL were noted between the groups; however, a trend toward a greater PKT at both 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.081;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.061) and 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 1.562;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.083) was observed for YA compared with MA. After controlling for BL, no significant group \u00d7 time interactions were observed for PKT at either 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.681;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.503) or 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.450;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.656). In addition, there were no significant main effects for time observed for PKT at either 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.272;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.746) or 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.109;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.910) for both groups combined.\nNo significant difference at BL was found for AVGT at 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.940;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.148), but a trend toward a greater AVGT was noted in YA at 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.008;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.094). When controlling for BL, no significant group \u00d7 time interactions were observed for AVGT at 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.897;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.404) or 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.769;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.484). In addition, no significant main effects for time were noted for AVGT at either 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.228;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.762) or 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.155;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.878).\nBlood Analyses\nChanges in CK and Mb can be found in\u00a0Figures 2\u00a0and\u00a03, respectively, whereas changes in CRP and IL-6 can be observed in\u00a0Figures 4\u00a0and\u00a05, respectively. No significant group \u00d7 time interactions were observed for Mb (F\u00a0= 0.307;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.640), CK (F\u00a0= 0.607;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.551), CRP (F\u00a0= 0.320;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.602), or IL-6 (F\u00a0= 0.466;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.589). However, significant main effects for time were observed for both Mb (F\u00a0= 8.708;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.005) and CK (F\u00a0= 8.127;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.001). Myoglobin was significantly higher at 30P (p\u00a0= 0.002), 60P (p\u00a0= 0.001), and 120P (p\u00a0= 0.007) compared with BL, whereas CK concentrations at 24 H (p\u00a0= 0.002) and 48 H (p\u00a0= 0.006) were significantly higher than BL. Although no significant main effect for time was observed for CRP (F\u00a0= 3.042;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.097), a significant main effect was noted for IL-6 (F\u00a0= 3.689;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.05). Changes in IL-6 were significantly elevated from BL at 30P (p\u00a0= 0.032), 120P (p\u00a0= 0.002), 24 H (p\u00a0= 0.007), and 48 H (p\u00a0= 0.034) for both groups combined.\nVisual Analog Scales\nChanges in subjective feelings of pain and soreness can be observed in\u00a0Table 3. No significant group \u00d7 time interactions were observed for subjective measures of pain (F\u00a0= 0.102;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.959) or soreness (F\u00a0= 0.886;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.455). No significant main effect for time was observed for subjective levels of pain (F\u00a0= 1.085;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.351); however, a significant main effect for time was observed for subjective levels of muscle soreness (F\u00a0= 7.319;\u00a0p\u00a0= < 0.001) in both groups combined. Muscle soreness was significantly higher at 30P (p\u00a0= 0.001), 24 H (p\u00a0= 0.001), and 48 H (p\u00a0= 0.002) compared with BL.\nUltrasound Assessment\nChanges in muscle CSA and MT can be observed in\u00a0Table 3. No significant group \u00d7 time interactions were observed for muscle CSA (F\u00a0= 0.246;\u00a0p\u00a00.747) or MT (F\u00a0= 0.687;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.530). However, a significant main effect for time was observed for both CSA (F\u00a0= 13.460;\u00a0p\u00a0< 0.001) and MT (F\u00a0= 3.685;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.028). Muscle CSA and MT were significantly greater at IP (p\u00a0< 0.001) compared with BL.\nDiscussion\nResults of this study indicated no differences in the recovery response between YA and MA for any of the performance measures, nor in subjective levels of muscle pain or soreness. Furthermore, no between-group differences were observed in the inflammatory or\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0response to the exercise protocol. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine differences in the recovery response from high-volume resistance exercise between recreationally trained young and middle-aged adults. Our results comparing BL performance measures seem to be in agreement with other investigations, demonstrating differences in strength measures between young (23\u009629 years) and older adults (60\u009665 years) (7,15,24), and between middle-aged (41\u009642 years) and older adults (70\u009672 years) (17,18). It does seem that the decline in strength may develop during middle age. However, recovery from exercise seems to be comparable in both younger and middle-aged adults as reflected by similar changes in performance and markers of\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0and\u00a0inflammation. Although changes in strength may occur in middle age, recovery from exercise does seem to be maintained in recreationally trained individuals.\nThe differences observed at BL in isometric force and the rate of force development is consistent with other investigations comparing younger and older adults (16,19,36). Although differences in age between young and middle-aged adults do seem to affect BL levels of strength, it does not seem to affect recovery from exercise. This is supported by similar patterns of\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0and\u00a0inflammation\u00a0observed during the recovery period after the HVP. Elevations in Mb and CK concentrations are consistent with the expected physiological response from a bout of resistance exercise (9,34). These results also suggest that middle-aged recreationally active men who regularly engage in\u00a0resistance training\u00a0do not seem to be at increased risk for greater soreness or\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0in comparison with younger recreationally trained men.\nSimilar response patterns were also noted in the inflammatory response for both groups. No significant elevations from BL were observed in CRP. However, significant increases in IL-6 concentrations were observed for both groups. Although CRP is an acute phase protein whose function is to activate the innate immune response and enhance phagocytosis (10), it does not seem to change after an acute bout of resistance exercise (6). Previous research has reported no significant changes in CRP concentrations after\u00a0resistance training\u00a0protocols recruiting primarily both upper-body (31) and lower-body exercises (4) in younger men. Furthermore, previous investigations have also indicated that training experience can reduce the CRP response to an acute bout of exercise (22,35). Considering that participants in both YA and MA were recreationally trained, it is likely that this training experience may have attenuated the CRP response. Physiologically, it is consistent with the lower stress and damage that occurs with repetitive training (9,35). Interleukin-6 is an inflammatory cytokine that facilitates communication for the mobilization, proliferation, and differentiation of immune cells to the site of tissue damage (6) and has been shown to increase after exercise (11). Elevations in IL-6 are related to the intensity, duration, and mode of training (11,13,32), but the literature is inconclusive regarding the IL-6 response to\u00a0resistance training. A recent study reported that a bout of high-volume resistance exercise (8 sets of 10 repetitions with 70% of maximal strength in the squat exercise) resulted in a significant elevation in IL-6 concentrations 30 min after exercise, but no changes were observed after a bout of high-intensity resistance exercise (8 sets of 3 repetitions with 90% of maximal strength in the squat exercise) in experienced, trained lifters (4). The IL-6 response observed during this investigation as a result of a bout of high-volume resistance exercise seems to be consistent with that recently reported by Bartolomei et al. (4). However, age did not seem to exacerbate nor attenuate the IL-6 response in recreationally trained participants.\nNo differences were noted in the inflammatory or\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0response between YA and MA. As discussed earlier, this is likely related to the recreational training background of the participants. However, there were several limitations to the study that need to be acknowledged. The exercise protocol was performed on an isokinetic dynamometer, which may not have as much practical application as most\u00a0resistance training\u00a0programs use dynamic constant resistance exercises. In addition, unilateral, single-joint exercise recruited a relatively smaller muscle mass than is commonly used in most training programs. The use of this modality of exercise, which has been demonstrated to be very effective in eliciting\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0(20,30), may not have been sufficient to elicit significant performance and inflammatory changes in these recreationally trained participants. Future research should examine modes of training specific to the typical training program of the participants.\nPractical Applications\nThe results of this study indicate that changes in muscle performance seem to begin during middle age, even in recreationally trained individuals. However, participating in recreational\u00a0resistance training\u00a0may mitigate any alteration in the recovery response from exercise. These results should be examined in the context that recovery was investigated after a unilateral, single-joint isokinetic exercise protocol. Although this method has been previously used as an effective mode of exercise to elicit\u00a0muscle damage, it is not specific to the type of exercises typically used by recreational lifters. Future studies may wish to compare these population groups using multijoint, dynamic constant resistance exercises common to the training programs of most recreational lifters, regardless of age.", "system_role": "You are a helpful assistant.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613", "prep_step": "In the summary, cover the following information:     \n- Identify the key points and statistics from this text that would make interesting or helpful health content.     \n- If available, include the effect sizes found in the research.

The accompanying increased prevalences of chronic illnesses, loss of musculoskeletal mass, frailty, and bone fragility increase the risk of falls and fractures.1 Loss of independence increases the number of people needing full time institutionalised care, the source of around 30% of all hip fractures in the community.2 Thus, targeting an intervention to all aged care residents is a rational approach to reducing the fracture burden in the whole community.\nThe widespread use of antiresorptive therapy is unlikely to reduce this fracture burden because of a paucity of evidence of antifracture efficacy in people over 80 years of age, the common occurrence of adverse events, and high cost given the large numbers of people that must be treated.3 However, these people often have calcium intakes below 700 mg daily, an amount unlikely to offset obligatory loss of calcium.4 They also often have protein intakes below 1 g/kg body weight/day, predisposing to loss of lean muscle mass.5 Thus, an alternative approach is to target all institutionalised older adults with a non-pharmaceutical nutritional intervention.\nFew studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of a nutritional approach to reduction of fracture risk in aged care residents. Chapuy and colleagues showed antifracture efficacy with pharmacological doses of calcium and vitamin D in female nursing home residents with low calcium intakes and vitamin D deficiency.6 No studies have examined the effects of protein supplementation on reduction of fracture risk, despite evidence of improved muscle function and reduced falls.7\nConsumption of milk, yoghurt, and cheese, foods rich in calcium and protein, slows bone loss and improves insulin-like growth factor 1.89 These foods are widely available, palatable, and low cost and so are likely to be adhered to. Accordingly, we conducted a prospective, two year, cluster randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that achieving recommended intakes of 1300 mg/day calcium and 1 g protein/kg body weight will reduce the risk of fragility fractures and falls when targeted to institutionalised older adults replete in vitamin D but with intakes below these levels.\nMethods\nStudy design\nThis two year, cluster randomised controlled trial involved recruitment of 60 residential aged care facilities housing 7195 older adults in metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria, Australia, between December 2013 and August 2016. To ensure similar standards of care, we recruited only facilities accredited with the Australian Aged-Care Accreditation Agency that housed predominantly ambulant residents. These facilities are similar to residential care in the UK and assisted care facilities in the US. Facilities recruited were representative of charitable, private, and religious organisations, with an even distribution of small (?50 beds), medium (51-100 beds), and large (>100 beds) facilities (supplementary figure C). The ratio of women to men and the age of residents were representative of the national average.10\nInclusion criteria\nRandomisation was by facility, not by individuals. For inclusion, facilities were required to provide no more than two servings of dairy foods daily, which was assessed from menu audits, as this level of provision is associated with dietary intakes of <1 g/kg body weight and 600 mg calcium daily.11 Vitamin D adequacy is maintained in residents through routine supplementation as foods are not fortified with vitamin D. We included only permanent residents in data analyses\u0097that is, we excluded data from respite residents.\nRandomisation procedure\nThe unit of randomisation was facility, as the intervention was delivered to all residents by the food service at each facility. Eligible facilities were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either intervention (n=30) or control (n=30), with the control facilities maintaining their existing menus. The randomisation was done with the use of a computer, with block sizes being varied according to organisation (to ensure similar procedures and policies), and was stratified by geographical location (to ensure similar socioeconomic status). A statistician independent of the study did the randomisation and provided the concealed group allocation to the principal investigator (SI) who, in turn, conveyed this allocation to the facility. SI was not involved in any data collection. An organisation may have between two and 10 facilities, and randomisation was done within an organisation.\nConsent\nFacility managers consented to provide de-identified details of age and sex of residents, as well as access to all incident reports including those for falls and fractures. Reporting of all incidents of any nature is a mandatory requirement of all accredited aged care providers. The accreditation agency regularly audits incident reports. Facilities are sanctioned if breaches are observed, with potential for accreditation to be revoked and government funding terminated. Falls (time, location, circumstances, and outcome/injury), fractures, and other adverse events were verified from these incident reports. These reports were maintained at all facilities. An independent medically trained person blinded to study allocation verified fractures by using hospital radiographs and radiographic reports. Residents and families were informed of the study during regular meetings. A subset of 371 residents from all facilities voluntarily consented to have dietary intake recorded, medical records reviewed, blood sampling, and measurement of body composition, bone mineral density, and bone microarchitecture performed. A next of kin consented for an additional 345 residents to allow dietary intake to be recorded and medical records reviewed.\nIntervention\nWe classified dairy foods by using the Australian Dietary Guidelines, with a \u0093serving\u0094 defined as 250 mL of milk, 200 g of yoghurt, and 40 g of cheese.12 Lactose-free options were provided to accommodate the few participants (<0.001%) with reported lactose intolerance. Butter, cream, and ice cream were not provided, as they contain little calcium or protein. All facilities prepared and cooked foods on site. We assigned intervention facilities a food service dietician to assist food service staff to increase the provision of dairy foods at all meals and snacks. Methods used to increase dairy foods included use of milk powder to fortify milk used in recipes and beverages. Dairy based desserts and snacks were offered in place of less nutritious foods such as cakes and biscuits. Foods provided were based on the preferences expressed by the residents at intervention sites.\nDairy foods were provided in-kind by Fonterra International (New Zealand) and distributed by a commercial food distribution company not associated with the project (Bidfoods, Australia). Use of a single distributor ensured accurate recording of costs for all dairy foods provided, with invoices used to verify compliance data. During dietary assessments, foods and beverages were weighed on a food scale (\u00b11 g) (Sohnele Page Profi, Germany) at all facilities. During two days every three months, dieticians assessed compliance by using the validated visual estimation of plate waste, with data collected from 55 000 foods and beverages during the study.13 We used nutritional analysis software (FoodWorks, Australia) or the Australian food composition database NUTTAB 2010 to calculate nutrient intakes.\nData monitoring\nData safety monitoring was carried out by the Study Trial Review Board, which was provided with quarterly reports.\nOutcomes\nAs per the approved study protocol, all pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes have been reported. The primary outcome was time to fragility fracture. Secondary outcomes were time to fall and changes in bone morphology and biochemistry. The tertiary outcomes of all cause mortality and changes in body composition are also reported. Exploratory outcomes including quality of life and muscle function were not examined (see original and final study protocols). Fasting morning serum samples were obtained from 189 residents at baseline and 12 months for measurement of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (baseline only), C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (a measure of bone resorption), procollagen type 1 N propeptide (a measure of bone formation), parathyroid hormone (Roche Cobas E170), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (LIASON) (supplementary figure A).\nBody composition and bone morphology were assessed at baseline and 12 months in 72 residents (supplementary figure B). Total and appendicular (arms and legs) lean mass and fat mass were determined from total body scans, and bone mineral density was measured at the lumbar spine and femoral neck using dual x-ray absorptiometry (Prodigy, GE Lunar, Madison, WI, CV=1%). Volumetric bone mineral density (the amount of bone contained within the external volume of bone, in g/cm3) was measured at the distal tibia and distal radius by using high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (Scanco Medical AG, Switzerland, CV 0.5\u00964.0%).14 Cortical porosity was determined using automated image processing (StrAx1.0, Straxcorp, Melbourne, Australia).\nBlinding and sample size\nOnce a facility was randomised, only the principal investigator, food service research dieticians, facility managers, and food service staff were aware of the allocation. Data acquisition and analyses were carried out by staff blinded to group allocation (SP, XW, MB, AGZ, and TN). Residents were blinded to the study; permission to conduct the study was obtained from the aged-care provider and facility managers. Some of the intervention strategies were not visible\u0097for example, fortification of milk with milk powder or modification of recipes. Some residents may have been aware of some changes, such as provision of cheese and biscuits for snacks, but not the reason for the changes.\nThe sample size was determined on the basis of a hypothesised effect size and intra-cluster correlation coefficient (r). Under the hypothesis that the intervention reduces the risk of fracture by 30%, based on previous antifracture calcium/vitamin D intervention in this setting, and that r ranges from 0.10 to 0.50, the sample size needed was 25 to 50 residents per facility and 25 facilities per arm to achieve the power of 80%.6 From falls data, we used an r of 0.20 to calculate the sample size.15 To account for approximately 20% annual attrition, we recruited 60 facilities with a minimum of 50 residents per facility.\nAt the start of the study, 3980 permanent residents were living in the participating facilities. We refer to these residents as the inception cohort. Recruitment continued throughout the 24 months to ensure that the required sample size was maintained, so we included data from residents admitted to facilities that replaced initial residents lost to follow-up due to death or discharge in analyses. We refer to these residents as the replacement cohort. In total, an additional 3215 residents were admitted to facilities after the study had started. We obtained details of new residents and those lost to follow-up from admission and discharge records from each facility.\nAnalyses\nWe expressed baseline data as mean and standard deviation, with the unit of analysis being clusters. We expressed fracture incidence, falls, and deaths per 100 person years of follow-up. We used the product limit (Kaplan-Meier) method to determine the cumulative risk of an event. No data were missing for these primary and secondary outcomes. The duration of follow-up was based on date of study entry to date of an event. When no event occurred, duration of follow-up was date of study entry to date of study termination.\nAs individuals were \u0093nested\u0094 within clusters (facilities), the primary analysis was based on the mixed effects Cox\u0092s proportional hazards model; effects of intervention, age, and sex were fixed effects, and the facility was considered the random effect (see supplementary methods for additional statistical analysis). We expressed the results as a hazard ratio with 95% confidence limits. We used the \u0093coxme\u0094 package to estimate model parameters. We also used the Fine-Gray sub-distribution method with the \u0093cmprsk\u0094 package to do mortality competing risk analysis.\nWe tested between group differences in serum biomarkers and measurements of body composition and bone morphology at baseline with the weighted t test, with cluster being the unit of analysis. Biomarkers were log transformed if they were not normally distributed. We analysed effects of the intervention by using the mixed effects model in which the within person change in outcome was modelled as a function of treatment or control group, time of follow-up, age, weight, and sex. All analyses used the R Statistical Environment.\nAmendments to protocol and statistical analysis plan\nInitially, facilities were matched only by location to account for socioeconomic status. We also accounted for organisations, as they contributed varying numbers of facilities and had different policies and procedures. We included facilities providing less than two servings of dairy food daily, as dietary assessments for all residents was not feasible. We quantified two day instead of three day diets, as this was adequate to capture regular intakes.11 We did not assess osteocalcin, as sufficient information is obtained from C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and procollagen type 1 N propeptide. We used only all cause mortality as a tertiary outcome, as cardiovascular events were not obtainable and causes of death were poorly documented. We did not examine exploratory outcomes related to quality of life and muscle function, as unanticipated attrition reduced the sample size resulting in insufficient power to detect an effect of treatment. We did not include bayesian analyses and imputations, as no values were missing for falls and fracture outcomes (original and final study protocols).\nPatient and public involvement\nWe consulted aged care residents, providers, and food service staff after the initial feasibility study that guided the design of this intervention.16 The manuscript was read by non-academics.\nResults\nOf the 60 facilities, 54 completed the 24 month intervention (fig 1). One control facility and three intervention facilities withdrew after randomisation. Two intervention facilities closed at months 15 and 20, but we included the data up to the date of closure. At baseline, the two groups had comparable demographics and were vitamin D replete. Daily baseline calcium and protein intakes were 689 (SD 266) mg and 57 (16) g respectively (table 1; supplementary figure D).\nNutritional changes\nDairy food intake increased from 2.0 to 3.5 servings daily in the intervention facilities (fig 2). The additional dairy foods, equivalent to 250 mL of milk plus 20 g cheese or 100 g yoghurt, provided 562 (166) mg calcium, achieving 1142 (353) mg calcium daily, and 12 (6) g protein, achieving an intake of 69 (15) g (1.1 g/kg body weight) daily. In control facilities, residents\u0092 dairy intakes remained at less than two servings daily providing 700 (247) mg calcium and 58 (14) g protein (0.9 g/kg body weight) daily. No adverse gastrointestinal events related to the intervention were reported. No detectable within or between group differences in energy intake were observed during follow-up (fig 2). However, we observed group differences for the change in body weight (table 2). In absolute terms, no weight change occurred in the intervention group (0.3 (95% confidence interval ?0.8 to 1.4) kg; P=0.56). In controls, a weight loss of 1.4 (0.6 to 2.1) kg, (P<0.001) was due to a 0.3 (?0.6 to 0.0) kg decline in appendicular lean mass (P=0.03) and 0.8 kg (?1.6 to ?0.2) decline in total body fat mass (P=0.02).\nFractures, falls, and mortality\nDuring 90 557 person months of follow-up (mean 12.6 (8.9) months), 324 fractures occurred: 121 (3.7%) in the intervention group and 203 (5.2%) in controls\u0097a 33% risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.93; P=0.02). Post hoc analysis indicated that the incidence of hip fracture was 1.3% (n=42) in the intervention group and 2.4% (n=93) in controls\u0097a 46% risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.54, 0.35 to 0.83; P=0.005). The separation in cumulative incidence of fractures between the groups achieved significance at five months for all fractures (P=0.02) and hip fractures (P=0.02) (fig 3). Competing risk analysis adjusted for mortality showed that the intervention was associated with average reductions in fracture risk of 27% (hazard ratio 0.73, 0.58 to 0.92) for all fractures and 44% (0.56, 0.39 to 0.82) for hip fractures.\nThe cumulative incidence of falls was 57% (n=1879) in the intervention group and 62% (n=2423) in controls\u0097an 11% relative risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.89, 0.78 to 0.98; P=0.04). The separation in the incidence of falls between groups achieved significance at three months (P=0.04) (fig 3). All but one fracture was the result of a fall. Mortality did not differ between the intervention and control groups (27% (n=900) v 28% (n=1074), respectively; hazard ratio 1.01, 0.43 to 3.08; P=0.91) (fig 3). The numbers needing treatment to prevent any fracture, hip fracture, or a fall were 52, 82, and 17, respectively.\nTo explore the veracity of the observations made in the entire cohort (n=7195), we examined the effects of the intervention on fracture risk and falls relative to controls in a post hoc analyses of residents present at the start of the study (n=3980, the inception cohort) and residents added after its start (n=3215, the replacement cohort), separately. The inception cohort was older than the replacement cohort (mean 86.5 (8.1) v 85.2 (8.4) years; P<0.001). However, age did not differ between the intervention and control groups in either the inception cohort (mean 86.7 (8.2) v 86.4 (8.0) years, respectively; P=0.25) or the replacement cohort (85.1 (8.5) v 85.3 (8.2) years, respectively; P=0.601). We observed significant reductions in all fractures, hip fractures, and falls in the intervention group relative to the controls in both the inception and replacement cohorts (see supplementary figure E).\nBiochemistry and bone morphology\nThe subgroup providing data for biochemistry, body composition, and bone morphology did not differ from the entire cohort in age (mean 85.9 (8.2) v 85.6 (8.2) years), proportion of women to men (70% (n=74) v 69% (n=57)), and proportion with previous fractures (38% (n=40) v 39 (n=32)). As shown in table 2, at 12 months, we observed a 20.4% between group difference in serum C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (P=0.002), the result of no change in the intervention group and a 13.1% increase in controls (P<0.05). We observed no between group difference in procollagen type 1 N propeptide or parathyroid hormone, but we observed a 7.9% between group difference in serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (P=0.04), the result of a 5.9% increase in the intervention group (P<0.05) and no change in controls.\nWe observed a 1.8% between group difference in spine bone mineral density (P=0.04), the result of a 2.1% increase in the intervention group (P<0.001) and no change in controls. The 1.7% between group difference in femoral neck bone mineral density was not significant (P=0.09). The 3.3% between group difference in distal radius total volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.02) and 2.0% between group difference in distal tibial total volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.07) were the result of decreases at each site in controls (both P<0.05). We observed a 4.6% between group difference in distal radial trabecular volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.03) due to a non-significant decrease in controls and a 0.7% increase in distal tibia cortical porosity in controls (P<0.05).\nDiscussion\nThis nutritional approach using high calcium and high protein dairy foods to increase calcium and protein intakes in institutionalised older adults replete in vitamin D was associated with a 33% reduction in risk of fractures of any type, a 46% reduction in risk of hip fractures, and an 11% reduction in risk of falls relative to controls. We found no group difference in all cause mortality.\nMost interventions aimed at reducing fracture risk target a drug therapy to people with osteoporosis because they are at high risk of fracture. This approach confers a large benefit to the individual and does so cost effectively, because few people need to be treated to avert one event. However, averting fractures in small numbers of people at high risk does not reduce the burden of fractures in the community.\nThe population burden of fractures\u0097the number of events, morbidity, mortality, and cost to the community\u0097arises from the vast numbers of people with risk factors that confer a modest attributable risk to the individual.17 For example, most fragility fractures in the community arise among women with osteopenia (bone mineral density T score \u00962.5 to \u00961 SD) because they form the largest segment of the community.18 Likewise, most fractures attributable to nutritional inadequacy arise among the great many people with intakes of calcium and protein that are below recommended levels.19 This nutritional inadequacy confers a small attributable risk to the individual but accounts for a large attributable fraction of the fracture burden in the community as a whole. This is the Geoffrey Rose prevention paradox\u0097a community based approach producing a small benefit to an individual may still confer a large benefit to the community.17 Safety is essential because most individuals treated may derive little or no benefit from the intervention. For example, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension study reduced blood pressure by replacing a \u0093western\u0094 diet with a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, and low fat dairy foods\u0097an approach associated with fewer cardiovascular events.20\nComparison with other studies\nMost nutrition based studies assessing antifracture efficacy in aged care residents and people in the community used pharmacological doses of calcium with or without vitamin D.21 In a meta-analysis of 17 of these studies, only two studies reported a reduction in fracture risk\u0097a study of nursing home residents with calcium intakes <600 mg/day and vitamin D concentrations <50 nmol/L and a community based study in women and men ?65 years of age with mean calcium intakes of 700 mg/day.21 In the remaining 15 studies, poor compliance, large numbers of dropouts, and a low prevalence of the risk factor may have contributed to the null findings.2223 Benefits are unlikely if the prevalence of a risk factor (such as inadequate calcium and protein intakes) is low.24 For example, in the meta-analysis, reduction in fracture risk reported with treatment was confined to the 7272 individuals with calcium intakes <700 mg/day (risk ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.89), not the 45 241 individuals with calcium intakes above 700 mg daily.21 The reduction in fracture risk observed with calcium and protein rich foods in this study may have been the result of attention to several of the above factors. Compliance was optimised by supervised provision and consumption of the foods. Participants lost to follow-up were replaced by newly admitted residents. We intentionally targeted a cohort at high risk for fracture in whom low calcium and protein intakes were common and so were likely to partly contribute to the already high fracture burden in this community.\nMechanisms of fracture risk reduction\nThis nutritional intervention produced two unanticipated novel observations. The risk reduction for falls and fractures was detected by three and five months, respectively, and the relative risk reduction for fractures was similar to that found in trials using potent antiresorptive therapy to treat people at high risk due to osteoporosis. The two most likely explanations for each of these observations is a risk reduction for falls and slowing progression of bone fragility. Insulin-like growth factor 1 increased in the intervention group only, whereas the decrease in appendicular lean mass was confined to controls, consistent with the notion that protein intakes of 1-1.5 g/kg/day is needed to prevent protein catabolism and preserve or increase muscle mass in older adults, particularly those at risk of malnutrition or frailty.25 The increase in serum C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and deterioration in tibial and radial total volumetric bone mineral density in controls was not seen in the intervention group, consistent with slowing of bone loss and slowing of microstructural deterioration.26 These changes were modest, but slowing microstructural deterioration disproportionately reduces progression of bone fragility because fragility increases as a power function to the bone loss producing it.27\nMortality did not differ between the groups. Some, but not all, studies suggest that milk consumption is associated with increased mortality but consumption of yoghurt and cheese (fermented foods) with reduced mortality and favourable blood lipid profiles.282930 Fermented and non-fermented dairy foods were used during the intervention. Milk consumption did not differ between the intervention and control groups (data not shown).\nLimitations of study\nThe study has several limitations. Less than half of the participants had follow-up longer than 15 months. However, the reduction in risk of fractures and falls was detected within six months. Measures of dietary intakes and causes of secondary osteoporosis were obtained from the subgroup of 716 consented participants, not all 7195 residents, so compliance was monitored in about 10% of residents. However, recorded intakes of 55 000 foods and beverages are likely to be representative of all residents as most, if not all, food is provided by facilities. Assessment of body composition, bone morphology, and biochemistry was confined to a subgroup of residents. Attrition of these participants limited the power to examine differences in body composition, bone morphology, and biochemistry between the groups. Therefore, our ability to make inferences concerning the role of this intervention in slowing microstructural deterioration and loss of muscle mass is limited. Serum parathyroid hormone remained unchanged, perhaps owing to administration of around 1100 mg of calcium throughout the day as food, not as a single supplement of elemental calcium.31 Moreover, this intervention used whole dairy foods, so any potential benefit of other components of the dairy matrix cannot be determined.\nSummary and conclusions\nIn summary, ageing of the population is associated with a greater number of older adults needing full time institutionalised care. These individuals are often malnourished.5 Although the risk of fracture attributable to undernutrition may be small in an individual, the large number of older adults in aged care confers a large fracture burden in the community; institutionalised people are the source of about 30% of all hip fractures.217 A high calcium and high protein nutritional intervention reduced the risk of falls and fractures. This intervention was tailored to the preferences of the residents and was successfully delivered through the food service using regular retail milk, yoghurt, and cheese incorporated into existing menus.

The accompanying increased prevalences of chronic illnesses, loss of musculoskeletal mass, frailty, and bone fragility increase the risk of falls and fractures.1 Loss of independence increases the number of people needing full time institutionalised care, the source of around 30% of all hip fractures in the community.2 Thus, targeting an intervention to all aged care residents is a rational approach to reducing the fracture burden in the whole community.\nThe widespread use of antiresorptive therapy is unlikely to reduce this fracture burden because of a paucity of evidence of antifracture efficacy in people over 80 years of age, the common occurrence of adverse events, and high cost given the large numbers of people that must be treated.3 However, these people often have calcium intakes below 700 mg daily, an amount unlikely to offset obligatory loss of calcium.4 They also often have protein intakes below 1 g/kg body weight/day, predisposing to loss of lean muscle mass.5 Thus, an alternative approach is to target all institutionalised older adults with a non-pharmaceutical nutritional intervention.\nFew studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of a nutritional approach to reduction of fracture risk in aged care residents. Chapuy and colleagues showed antifracture efficacy with pharmacological doses of calcium and vitamin D in female nursing home residents with low calcium intakes and vitamin D deficiency.6 No studies have examined the effects of protein supplementation on reduction of fracture risk, despite evidence of improved muscle function and reduced falls.7\nConsumption of milk, yoghurt, and cheese, foods rich in calcium and protein, slows bone loss and improves insulin-like growth factor 1.89 These foods are widely available, palatable, and low cost and so are likely to be adhered to. Accordingly, we conducted a prospective, two year, cluster randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that achieving recommended intakes of 1300 mg/day calcium and 1 g protein/kg body weight will reduce the risk of fragility fractures and falls when targeted to institutionalised older adults replete in vitamin D but with intakes below these levels.\nMethods\nStudy design\nThis two year, cluster randomised controlled trial involved recruitment of 60 residential aged care facilities housing 7195 older adults in metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria, Australia, between December 2013 and August 2016. To ensure similar standards of care, we recruited only facilities accredited with the Australian Aged-Care Accreditation Agency that housed predominantly ambulant residents. These facilities are similar to residential care in the UK and assisted care facilities in the US. Facilities recruited were representative of charitable, private, and religious organisations, with an even distribution of small (?50 beds), medium (51-100 beds), and large (>100 beds) facilities (supplementary figure C). The ratio of women to men and the age of residents were representative of the national average.10\nInclusion criteria\nRandomisation was by facility, not by individuals. For inclusion, facilities were required to provide no more than two servings of dairy foods daily, which was assessed from menu audits, as this level of provision is associated with dietary intakes of <1 g/kg body weight and 600 mg calcium daily.11 Vitamin D adequacy is maintained in residents through routine supplementation as foods are not fortified with vitamin D. We included only permanent residents in data analyses\u0097that is, we excluded data from respite residents.\nRandomisation procedure\nThe unit of randomisation was facility, as the intervention was delivered to all residents by the food service at each facility. Eligible facilities were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either intervention (n=30) or control (n=30), with the control facilities maintaining their existing menus. The randomisation was done with the use of a computer, with block sizes being varied according to organisation (to ensure similar procedures and policies), and was stratified by geographical location (to ensure similar socioeconomic status). A statistician independent of the study did the randomisation and provided the concealed group allocation to the principal investigator (SI) who, in turn, conveyed this allocation to the facility. SI was not involved in any data collection. An organisation may have between two and 10 facilities, and randomisation was done within an organisation.\nConsent\nFacility managers consented to provide de-identified details of age and sex of residents, as well as access to all incident reports including those for falls and fractures. Reporting of all incidents of any nature is a mandatory requirement of all accredited aged care providers. The accreditation agency regularly audits incident reports. Facilities are sanctioned if breaches are observed, with potential for accreditation to be revoked and government funding terminated. Falls (time, location, circumstances, and outcome/injury), fractures, and other adverse events were verified from these incident reports. These reports were maintained at all facilities. An independent medically trained person blinded to study allocation verified fractures by using hospital radiographs and radiographic reports. Residents and families were informed of the study during regular meetings. A subset of 371 residents from all facilities voluntarily consented to have dietary intake recorded, medical records reviewed, blood sampling, and measurement of body composition, bone mineral density, and bone microarchitecture performed. A next of kin consented for an additional 345 residents to allow dietary intake to be recorded and medical records reviewed.\nIntervention\nWe classified dairy foods by using the Australian Dietary Guidelines, with a \u0093serving\u0094 defined as 250 mL of milk, 200 g of yoghurt, and 40 g of cheese.12 Lactose-free options were provided to accommodate the few participants (<0.001%) with reported lactose intolerance. Butter, cream, and ice cream were not provided, as they contain little calcium or protein. All facilities prepared and cooked foods on site. We assigned intervention facilities a food service dietician to assist food service staff to increase the provision of dairy foods at all meals and snacks. Methods used to increase dairy foods included use of milk powder to fortify milk used in recipes and beverages. Dairy based desserts and snacks were offered in place of less nutritious foods such as cakes and biscuits. Foods provided were based on the preferences expressed by the residents at intervention sites.\nDairy foods were provided in-kind by Fonterra International (New Zealand) and distributed by a commercial food distribution company not associated with the project (Bidfoods, Australia). Use of a single distributor ensured accurate recording of costs for all dairy foods provided, with invoices used to verify compliance data. During dietary assessments, foods and beverages were weighed on a food scale (\u00b11 g) (Sohnele Page Profi, Germany) at all facilities. During two days every three months, dieticians assessed compliance by using the validated visual estimation of plate waste, with data collected from 55 000 foods and beverages during the study.13 We used nutritional analysis software (FoodWorks, Australia) or the Australian food composition database NUTTAB 2010 to calculate nutrient intakes.\nData monitoring\nData safety monitoring was carried out by the Study Trial Review Board, which was provided with quarterly reports.\nOutcomes\nAs per the approved study protocol, all pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes have been reported. The primary outcome was time to fragility fracture. Secondary outcomes were time to fall and changes in bone morphology and biochemistry. The tertiary outcomes of all cause mortality and changes in body composition are also reported. Exploratory outcomes including quality of life and muscle function were not examined (see original and final study protocols). Fasting morning serum samples were obtained from 189 residents at baseline and 12 months for measurement of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (baseline only), C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (a measure of bone resorption), procollagen type 1 N propeptide (a measure of bone formation), parathyroid hormone (Roche Cobas E170), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (LIASON) (supplementary figure A).\nBody composition and bone morphology were assessed at baseline and 12 months in 72 residents (supplementary figure B). Total and appendicular (arms and legs) lean mass and fat mass were determined from total body scans, and bone mineral density was measured at the lumbar spine and femoral neck using dual x-ray absorptiometry (Prodigy, GE Lunar, Madison, WI, CV=1%). Volumetric bone mineral density (the amount of bone contained within the external volume of bone, in g/cm3) was measured at the distal tibia and distal radius by using high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (Scanco Medical AG, Switzerland, CV 0.5\u00964.0%).14 Cortical porosity was determined using automated image processing (StrAx1.0, Straxcorp, Melbourne, Australia).\nBlinding and sample size\nOnce a facility was randomised, only the principal investigator, food service research dieticians, facility managers, and food service staff were aware of the allocation. Data acquisition and analyses were carried out by staff blinded to group allocation (SP, XW, MB, AGZ, and TN). Residents were blinded to the study; permission to conduct the study was obtained from the aged-care provider and facility managers. Some of the intervention strategies were not visible\u0097for example, fortification of milk with milk powder or modification of recipes. Some residents may have been aware of some changes, such as provision of cheese and biscuits for snacks, but not the reason for the changes.\nThe sample size was determined on the basis of a hypothesised effect size and intra-cluster correlation coefficient (r). Under the hypothesis that the intervention reduces the risk of fracture by 30%, based on previous antifracture calcium/vitamin D intervention in this setting, and that r ranges from 0.10 to 0.50, the sample size needed was 25 to 50 residents per facility and 25 facilities per arm to achieve the power of 80%.6 From falls data, we used an r of 0.20 to calculate the sample size.15 To account for approximately 20% annual attrition, we recruited 60 facilities with a minimum of 50 residents per facility.\nAt the start of the study, 3980 permanent residents were living in the participating facilities. We refer to these residents as the inception cohort. Recruitment continued throughout the 24 months to ensure that the required sample size was maintained, so we included data from residents admitted to facilities that replaced initial residents lost to follow-up due to death or discharge in analyses. We refer to these residents as the replacement cohort. In total, an additional 3215 residents were admitted to facilities after the study had started. We obtained details of new residents and those lost to follow-up from admission and discharge records from each facility.\nAnalyses\nWe expressed baseline data as mean and standard deviation, with the unit of analysis being clusters. We expressed fracture incidence, falls, and deaths per 100 person years of follow-up. We used the product limit (Kaplan-Meier) method to determine the cumulative risk of an event. No data were missing for these primary and secondary outcomes. The duration of follow-up was based on date of study entry to date of an event. When no event occurred, duration of follow-up was date of study entry to date of study termination.\nAs individuals were \u0093nested\u0094 within clusters (facilities), the primary analysis was based on the mixed effects Cox\u0092s proportional hazards model; effects of intervention, age, and sex were fixed effects, and the facility was considered the random effect (see supplementary methods for additional statistical analysis). We expressed the results as a hazard ratio with 95% confidence limits. We used the \u0093coxme\u0094 package to estimate model parameters. We also used the Fine-Gray sub-distribution method with the \u0093cmprsk\u0094 package to do mortality competing risk analysis.\nWe tested between group differences in serum biomarkers and measurements of body composition and bone morphology at baseline with the weighted t test, with cluster being the unit of analysis. Biomarkers were log transformed if they were not normally distributed. We analysed effects of the intervention by using the mixed effects model in which the within person change in outcome was modelled as a function of treatment or control group, time of follow-up, age, weight, and sex. All analyses used the R Statistical Environment.\nAmendments to protocol and statistical analysis plan\nInitially, facilities were matched only by location to account for socioeconomic status. We also accounted for organisations, as they contributed varying numbers of facilities and had different policies and procedures. We included facilities providing less than two servings of dairy food daily, as dietary assessments for all residents was not feasible. We quantified two day instead of three day diets, as this was adequate to capture regular intakes.11 We did not assess osteocalcin, as sufficient information is obtained from C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and procollagen type 1 N propeptide. We used only all cause mortality as a tertiary outcome, as cardiovascular events were not obtainable and causes of death were poorly documented. We did not examine exploratory outcomes related to quality of life and muscle function, as unanticipated attrition reduced the sample size resulting in insufficient power to detect an effect of treatment. We did not include bayesian analyses and imputations, as no values were missing for falls and fracture outcomes (original and final study protocols).\nPatient and public involvement\nWe consulted aged care residents, providers, and food service staff after the initial feasibility study that guided the design of this intervention.16 The manuscript was read by non-academics.\nResults\nOf the 60 facilities, 54 completed the 24 month intervention (fig 1). One control facility and three intervention facilities withdrew after randomisation. Two intervention facilities closed at months 15 and 20, but we included the data up to the date of closure. At baseline, the two groups had comparable demographics and were vitamin D replete. Daily baseline calcium and protein intakes were 689 (SD 266) mg and 57 (16) g respectively (table 1; supplementary figure D).\nNutritional changes\nDairy food intake increased from 2.0 to 3.5 servings daily in the intervention facilities (fig 2). The additional dairy foods, equivalent to 250 mL of milk plus 20 g cheese or 100 g yoghurt, provided 562 (166) mg calcium, achieving 1142 (353) mg calcium daily, and 12 (6) g protein, achieving an intake of 69 (15) g (1.1 g/kg body weight) daily. In control facilities, residents\u0092 dairy intakes remained at less than two servings daily providing 700 (247) mg calcium and 58 (14) g protein (0.9 g/kg body weight) daily. No adverse gastrointestinal events related to the intervention were reported. No detectable within or between group differences in energy intake were observed during follow-up (fig 2). However, we observed group differences for the change in body weight (table 2). In absolute terms, no weight change occurred in the intervention group (0.3 (95% confidence interval ?0.8 to 1.4) kg; P=0.56). In controls, a weight loss of 1.4 (0.6 to 2.1) kg, (P<0.001) was due to a 0.3 (?0.6 to 0.0) kg decline in appendicular lean mass (P=0.03) and 0.8 kg (?1.6 to ?0.2) decline in total body fat mass (P=0.02).\nFractures, falls, and mortality\nDuring 90 557 person months of follow-up (mean 12.6 (8.9) months), 324 fractures occurred: 121 (3.7%) in the intervention group and 203 (5.2%) in controls\u0097a 33% risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.93; P=0.02). Post hoc analysis indicated that the incidence of hip fracture was 1.3% (n=42) in the intervention group and 2.4% (n=93) in controls\u0097a 46% risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.54, 0.35 to 0.83; P=0.005). The separation in cumulative incidence of fractures between the groups achieved significance at five months for all fractures (P=0.02) and hip fractures (P=0.02) (fig 3). Competing risk analysis adjusted for mortality showed that the intervention was associated with average reductions in fracture risk of 27% (hazard ratio 0.73, 0.58 to 0.92) for all fractures and 44% (0.56, 0.39 to 0.82) for hip fractures.\nThe cumulative incidence of falls was 57% (n=1879) in the intervention group and 62% (n=2423) in controls\u0097an 11% relative risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.89, 0.78 to 0.98; P=0.04). The separation in the incidence of falls between groups achieved significance at three months (P=0.04) (fig 3). All but one fracture was the result of a fall. Mortality did not differ between the intervention and control groups (27% (n=900) v 28% (n=1074), respectively; hazard ratio 1.01, 0.43 to 3.08; P=0.91) (fig 3). The numbers needing treatment to prevent any fracture, hip fracture, or a fall were 52, 82, and 17, respectively.\nTo explore the veracity of the observations made in the entire cohort (n=7195), we examined the effects of the intervention on fracture risk and falls relative to controls in a post hoc analyses of residents present at the start of the study (n=3980, the inception cohort) and residents added after its start (n=3215, the replacement cohort), separately. The inception cohort was older than the replacement cohort (mean 86.5 (8.1) v 85.2 (8.4) years; P<0.001). However, age did not differ between the intervention and control groups in either the inception cohort (mean 86.7 (8.2) v 86.4 (8.0) years, respectively; P=0.25) or the replacement cohort (85.1 (8.5) v 85.3 (8.2) years, respectively; P=0.601). We observed significant reductions in all fractures, hip fractures, and falls in the intervention group relative to the controls in both the inception and replacement cohorts (see supplementary figure E).\nBiochemistry and bone morphology\nThe subgroup providing data for biochemistry, body composition, and bone morphology did not differ from the entire cohort in age (mean 85.9 (8.2) v 85.6 (8.2) years), proportion of women to men (70% (n=74) v 69% (n=57)), and proportion with previous fractures (38% (n=40) v 39 (n=32)). As shown in table 2, at 12 months, we observed a 20.4% between group difference in serum C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (P=0.002), the result of no change in the intervention group and a 13.1% increase in controls (P<0.05). We observed no between group difference in procollagen type 1 N propeptide or parathyroid hormone, but we observed a 7.9% between group difference in serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (P=0.04), the result of a 5.9% increase in the intervention group (P<0.05) and no change in controls.\nWe observed a 1.8% between group difference in spine bone mineral density (P=0.04), the result of a 2.1% increase in the intervention group (P<0.001) and no change in controls. The 1.7% between group difference in femoral neck bone mineral density was not significant (P=0.09). The 3.3% between group difference in distal radius total volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.02) and 2.0% between group difference in distal tibial total volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.07) were the result of decreases at each site in controls (both P<0.05). We observed a 4.6% between group difference in distal radial trabecular volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.03) due to a non-significant decrease in controls and a 0.7% increase in distal tibia cortical porosity in controls (P<0.05).\nDiscussion\nThis nutritional approach using high calcium and high protein dairy foods to increase calcium and protein intakes in institutionalised older adults replete in vitamin D was associated with a 33% reduction in risk of fractures of any type, a 46% reduction in risk of hip fractures, and an 11% reduction in risk of falls relative to controls. We found no group difference in all cause mortality.\nMost interventions aimed at reducing fracture risk target a drug therapy to people with osteoporosis because they are at high risk of fracture. This approach confers a large benefit to the individual and does so cost effectively, because few people need to be treated to avert one event. However, averting fractures in small numbers of people at high risk does not reduce the burden of fractures in the community.\nThe population burden of fractures\u0097the number of events, morbidity, mortality, and cost to the community\u0097arises from the vast numbers of people with risk factors that confer a modest attributable risk to the individual.17 For example, most fragility fractures in the community arise among women with osteopenia (bone mineral density T score \u00962.5 to \u00961 SD) because they form the largest segment of the community.18 Likewise, most fractures attributable to nutritional inadequacy arise among the great many people with intakes of calcium and protein that are below recommended levels.19 This nutritional inadequacy confers a small attributable risk to the individual but accounts for a large attributable fraction of the fracture burden in the community as a whole. This is the Geoffrey Rose prevention paradox\u0097a community based approach producing a small benefit to an individual may still confer a large benefit to the community.17 Safety is essential because most individuals treated may derive little or no benefit from the intervention. For example, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension study reduced blood pressure by replacing a \u0093western\u0094 diet with a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, and low fat dairy foods\u0097an approach associated with fewer cardiovascular events.20\nComparison with other studies\nMost nutrition based studies assessing antifracture efficacy in aged care residents and people in the community used pharmacological doses of calcium with or without vitamin D.21 In a meta-analysis of 17 of these studies, only two studies reported a reduction in fracture risk\u0097a study of nursing home residents with calcium intakes <600 mg/day and vitamin D concentrations <50 nmol/L and a community based study in women and men ?65 years of age with mean calcium intakes of 700 mg/day.21 In the remaining 15 studies, poor compliance, large numbers of dropouts, and a low prevalence of the risk factor may have contributed to the null findings.2223 Benefits are unlikely if the prevalence of a risk factor (such as inadequate calcium and protein intakes) is low.24 For example, in the meta-analysis, reduction in fracture risk reported with treatment was confined to the 7272 individuals with calcium intakes <700 mg/day (risk ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.89), not the 45 241 individuals with calcium intakes above 700 mg daily.21 The reduction in fracture risk observed with calcium and protein rich foods in this study may have been the result of attention to several of the above factors. Compliance was optimised by supervised provision and consumption of the foods. Participants lost to follow-up were replaced by newly admitted residents. We intentionally targeted a cohort at high risk for fracture in whom low calcium and protein intakes were common and so were likely to partly contribute to the already high fracture burden in this community.\nMechanisms of fracture risk reduction\nThis nutritional intervention produced two unanticipated novel observations. The risk reduction for falls and fractures was detected by three and five months, respectively, and the relative risk reduction for fractures was similar to that found in trials using potent antiresorptive therapy to treat people at high risk due to osteoporosis. The two most likely explanations for each of these observations is a risk reduction for falls and slowing progression of bone fragility. Insulin-like growth factor 1 increased in the intervention group only, whereas the decrease in appendicular lean mass was confined to controls, consistent with the notion that protein intakes of 1-1.5 g/kg/day is needed to prevent protein catabolism and preserve or increase muscle mass in older adults, particularly those at risk of malnutrition or frailty.25 The increase in serum C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and deterioration in tibial and radial total volumetric bone mineral density in controls was not seen in the intervention group, consistent with slowing of bone loss and slowing of microstructural deterioration.26 These changes were modest, but slowing microstructural deterioration disproportionately reduces progression of bone fragility because fragility increases as a power function to the bone loss producing it.27\nMortality did not differ between the groups. Some, but not all, studies suggest that milk consumption is associated with increased mortality but consumption of yoghurt and cheese (fermented foods) with reduced mortality and favourable blood lipid profiles.282930 Fermented and non-fermented dairy foods were used during the intervention. Milk consumption did not differ between the intervention and control groups (data not shown).\nLimitations of study\nThe study has several limitations. Less than half of the participants had follow-up longer than 15 months. However, the reduction in risk of fractures and falls was detected within six months. Measures of dietary intakes and causes of secondary osteoporosis were obtained from the subgroup of 716 consented participants, not all 7195 residents, so compliance was monitored in about 10% of residents. However, recorded intakes of 55 000 foods and beverages are likely to be representative of all residents as most, if not all, food is provided by facilities. Assessment of body composition, bone morphology, and biochemistry was confined to a subgroup of residents. Attrition of these participants limited the power to examine differences in body composition, bone morphology, and biochemistry between the groups. Therefore, our ability to make inferences concerning the role of this intervention in slowing microstructural deterioration and loss of muscle mass is limited. Serum parathyroid hormone remained unchanged, perhaps owing to administration of around 1100 mg of calcium throughout the day as food, not as a single supplement of elemental calcium.31 Moreover, this intervention used whole dairy foods, so any potential benefit of other components of the dairy matrix cannot be determined.\nSummary and conclusions\nIn summary, ageing of the population is associated with a greater number of older adults needing full time institutionalised care. These individuals are often malnourished.5 Although the risk of fracture attributable to undernutrition may be small in an individual, the large number of older adults in aged care confers a large fracture burden in the community; institutionalised people are the source of about 30% of all hip fractures.217 A high calcium and high protein nutritional intervention reduced the risk of falls and fractures. This intervention was tailored to the preferences of the residents and was successfully delivered through the food service using regular retail milk, yoghurt, and cheese incorporated into existing menus.

Although the detrimental effects of physical inactivity (i.e., achieving insufficient amounts of weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity) (1) are widely recognized, many individuals fail to meet current physical activity guidelines because of a perceived lack of time and barriers accessing equipment and facilities (4,5). Vigorous intermittent exercise including various interventions deemed \u0093high-intensity\u0094 and \u0093sprint\u0094 interval training (HIIT and SIT, respectively) can enhance CRF and other health-related markers similar to traditional moderate-intensity continuous training (6\u00969). Although efficacious to improve fitness and health, these protocols typically require dedicated leisure time and can be difficult to implement outside controlled laboratory settings. There also is increasing appreciation for the independent effect of sedentary behavior on cardiometabolic risk (3,10,11) and the benefits of breaking up sedentary time with more frequent bouts of activity throughout the day (12\u009614).\n\nThe application of HIIT/SIT principles to more feasible and accessible forms of exercise that can improve CRF and simultaneously reduce the negative impacts of prolonged sedentary time offers a novel method to enhance health outcomes in the general population. One such strategy involves performing brief isolated bouts of vigorous exercise over the course of the day. This approach, called \u0093exercise snacks,\u0094 can obviate the requirement for specialized equipment and alleviates the need for planning and allocating leisure time for structured exercise. It can be incorporated in between or structured within activities of daily living and implemented in a home, office, or school setting. An important added benefit of exercise snacks beyond their potential to improve CRF in a practical manner (15) is that they can naturally break up periods of prolonged sitting to reduce sedentary behavior and the associated health consequences (16).\n\nSeveral recent reports have shown that exercise snacks can boost indices of cardiometabolic health in young inactive adults (15\u009618). These studies have involved relatively small numbers of participants and should be classified primarily as proof-of-concept. Nonetheless, the emerging body of research highlights the potential value of exercise snacks as an additional tool in the repertoire of strategies aimed at increasing physical activity and improving cardiometabolic health among the general population. The purpose of this review is to highlight key findings from these studies to support our novel central hypothesis that exercise snacks are a feasible, well-tolerated, and time-efficient approach to improve CRF and reduce the negative impact of sedentary behavior on cardiometabolic health.\n\nWHAT ARE EXERCISE SNACKS?\nTo our knowledge, the term \u0093exercise snacks\u0094 was first used by Dr Howard Hartley in a 2007 weekly news magazine article (https://www.newsweek.com/exercise-snack-plan-96095). A 2014 study by Francois et al. (19), which demonstrated the benefits of brief intermittent bouts of vigorous-intensity walking for glycemic control in individuals with insulin resistance, seems to be the first to use the term in a peer-reviewed article. The protocol in that original study involved an 11-min exercise session (6 \u00d7 1-min bouts with 1-min recovery periods) in addition to a 5-min warm-up and 3-min cooldown performed on three separate occasions during the day before meals (19). In contrast, more recent studies have adopted the term \u0093exercise snacks\u0094 to describe isolated bouts of vigorous exercise lasting ?1 min that are performed multiple times throughout the day (15\u009618). The brief nature of exercise bouts that correspond to the latter definition makes it challenging to gauge intensity based on most traditional metrics including percentages of maximal heart rate (HR) or maximal oxygen uptake (V?O2), which may not be sensitive enough to accurately reflect the physiological demands imposed on cardiac or skeletal muscle during short bouts of vigorous activity. A similar argument can be made against the use of the Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) 6\u009620 scale in this scenario, which, to our knowledge, has not been validated for brief isolated bouts of vigorous exercise that typify exercise snacks. Rather, for the purpose of characterizing exercise snacks, it seems most practical to gauge relative effort, which in our published articles has resulted typically in mean values close to or greater than 5 \u0097 or a \u0093hard\u0094 effort \u0097 on the Borg category ratio 10 (CR10) scale (15\u009617). As such, although our focus is on studies that fit this definition, we acknowledge the health benefits conferred by other practical variations of brief activity breaks (12,14,20) and brief vigorous exercise that could align with concepts related to our definition of exercise snacks (19,21\u009625).\n\nTHE EFFICACY OF EXERCISE SNACKS FOR IMPROVING CRF IN INACTIVE ADULTS\nOur first exercise snacks study (15) was developed based on previous work showing a ~1 MET improvement in CRF after a 6-wk stair climbing protocol that involved 3 \u00d7 20-s hard efforts over a 10-min period performed 3 d\u00b7wk?1 (26). In the subsequent study (15), we exposed previously inactive young adults to an intervention involving either three daily bouts of vigorous stair climbing performed 1\u00964 h apart on 3 d\u00b7wk?1 or a no-exercise control (n = 12 per group) (15). For each stair-based exercise snack, participants were instructed to safely ascend 60 steps in a three-flight stairwell as quickly as possible. Each exercise snack was preceded by a dynamic warm-up (10 jumping jacks, 10 air squats, and 5 lunges on each side) and followed by a 1-min walking cooldown. After the 6-wk intervention, there were modest, albeit significant, improvements in CRF as measured using cycling V?O2peak and peak power output in the exercise snacks group as compared with control (15). CRF and peak power output values in the exercise snacks group were ~5% and ~12% higher postintervention, respectively, as compared with baseline. Of note, the vigorous exercise snacks elicited mean RPE values corresponding to a \u0093hard\u0094 effort (5 \u00b1 1 on the Borg CR10 scale) and mean HR responses equating ~85% of the age-predicted maximum over the course of the training intervention (15).\n\nThe potential for exercise snacks to improve CRF (15) was confirmed in a study involving three isolated 20-s \u0093all-out\u0094 cycling bouts (each with a 2-min warm-up and 1-min cooldown) performed 1\u00964 h apart (17). V?O2peak and time-trial performance improved by ~4% and ~9%, respectively, over a 6-wk period in a group of 12 inactive adults (17). The CRF and performance gains with cycling-based exercise snacks seemed to be similar in magnitude to those observed in participants who were randomized to a traditional SIT protocol in this study, although the study was admittedly underpowered for between-group comparisons (Fig. 1). These results suggest that the vigorous nature of these protocols may be a more important adaptive stimulus than performing successive bouts of fatiguing exercise within a short period. In support of this supposition, an isolated 10-s sprint is sufficient to alter the concentration of intramuscular metabolites (27), and a 30-s sprint activates key intracellular signaling cascades involved in mediating training adaptation (e.g., adenosine monophosphate (AMP)\u0096activated protein kinase) (28). These findings extended earlier work in 18 middle-aged females demonstrating a ~14% improvement in V?O2peak when three isolated 30-s Wingate tests undertaken 4 h apart were performed thrice weekly over an 8-wk period (29).\n\nTaken together, evidence gleaned from the aforementioned studies suggests that vigorous exercise snacks are an effective strategy to improve CRF and indices of exercise performance in previously inactive adults. Despite participants in our studies still being considered physically inactive based on the recently revised Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (i.e., by completing exercise snacks, they would not necessarily achieve 150 min of moderate-intensity or 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both each week (30)), the CRF gains conferred by the exercise snacks approach would still be expected to have health benefits (2). Importantly, for the adoption of exercise snacks by the general population outside the laboratory, the CRF gains attained using the exercise snacks approach do not require all-out efforts (15) and are apparent using both cycling-based exercise snacks and a more practical stair-based snack protocol that can be easily implemented in a home-, school-, or office-based setting.\n\nTHE FEASIBILITY OF EXERCISE SNACKS IN PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL POPULATIONS\nSedentary behavior is linked to adverse metabolic outcomes independent of CRF and physical activity levels (3,10,11), and evidence from both observational and interventional studies supports the health benefits of interrupting sedentary time with bouts of low- to moderate-intensity physical activity such as walking (12\u009614). Although these strategies effectively mitigate the cardiometabolic health defects arising from sedentary behavior, practical lifestyle approaches that break up prolonged periods of inactivity while simultaneously improving in CRF in populations at risk for, or diagnosed with, cardiometabolic disease (e.g., type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease) are presently limited. Relatedly, a large proportion of individuals in this demographic are elderly and have low physical fitness levels or other disease-related risk factors that may prevent participation in traditional forms of exercise that are typically well suited for healthy adults. Thus, there is an urgent need for feasible exercise strategies that can effectively improve cardiometabolic health in these populations.\n\nRecent work from our laboratory supports the feasibility and efficacy of vigorous exercise snacks to disrupt prolonged periods of inactivity and improve cardiometabolic health markers in preclinical and clinical populations. Using a randomized crossover design, we demonstrated that breaking up 9 h of sitting with hourly bouts of vigorous stair-based exercise snacks (~15\u009630 s) significantly reduced the area under the curve for insulin by ~17% and nonesterified fatty acids by ~21% in 11 adults with overweight/obesity (Fig. 2) (16). Unlike our previous studies (15,17), we opted not to include a warm-up and cooldown in this study to capture what an exercise snack may look like in the real world. These preliminary findings are reinforced by a recent study from Wolfe et al. (31) that reported improvements in some measures of metabolic control when 8 h of continuous sitting was compared with a condition where participants performed 5 \u00d7 4-second maximal cycling sprints on a specialized ergometer, once per hour. Breaking up prolonged sitting with hourly sprints resulted in a ~31% reduction in postprandial plasma triglycerides and 43% increase in fat oxidation after the consumption of a high-fat meal on the morning after the experimental trial (31). The exercise protocol was not strictly an exercise snacks study per our definition here, however, because it involved a total of 20 s of maximal intensity cycling over ~4\u00965 min once per hour. Other reports also show the feasibility of short practical bouts of stair-based vigorous exercise in individuals with type 2 diabetes (32) and coronary artery disease (33,34), and research into the potential of exercise snacks for improving metabolic outcomes in clinical populations represents a promising avenue for future work. It will also be of interest to examine how the more vigorous exercise snacks approach discussed here compares to breaking up prolonged sitting with frequent light- to moderate-activity breaks \u0097 an approach that has previously demonstrated benefits for improving markers of metabolic control in individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes (12,14,20,35).\n\nTHE POTENTIAL FOR EXERCISE SNACKS TO IMPROVE VASCULAR HEALTH\nIn addition to causing metabolic disruptions, prolonged sitting also reduces leg blood flow and shear stress \u0097 factors implicated in endothelial dysfunction and the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (36,37). The detrimental effects of sedentary behavior on vascular function can be mitigated when exercise is undertaken before (38), during (39), or immediately after (40) an extended bout of prolonged sitting. In this regard, recent work from our laboratory also supports the potential for exercise snacks to improve vascular function during extended periods of sitting. Caldwell et al. (18) exposed 10 healthy males to ~8.5 h of sitting with or without hourly stair-based exercise snacks involving ~14\u009620 s of ascending three flights of stairs at a brisk speed. Significant improvements in femoral artery hemodynamics, but not flow-mediated dilation (FMD), were apparent when prolonged sitting was interrupted with hourly exercise snacks, as reflected by ~32% higher blood flow and vascular conductance and a ~15% increase in shear rate (18) (Fig. 3). Although we are unaware of other studies examining vascular function in response to the exercise snacks approach as defined here, our work is supported by recent observations of improved popliteal artery blood flow and shear rate in healthy adults when a postprandial 4-h sitting period is interrupted with hourly 5-min bouts of vigorous stair climbing (23). Notably, the longer stair climbing bouts used by Cho et al. (23) also offset the reduction in FMD during prolonged sitting, suggesting that longer acute bouts of exercise may be required to elicit favorable effects on this parameter of vascular function. Taken together, these findings support the potential of exercise snacks to favorably impact vascular health, although additional studies are required to confirm the findings presented here, particularly with regard to the effects of exercise snacks on vascular and endothelial function.\n\nWHERE DO EXERCISE SNACKS FIT IN?\nExercise snacks align with the recently revised Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines on Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior (30,41). In recognition of the potential health benefits of short bouts of physical activity, the updated recommendations from these and other organizations eliminated the previous requirement that physical activity had to be accumulated in bouts lasting at least 10-min minimum (30,41). In line with this recommendation, other work has demonstrated the maintenance of health benefits when splitting longer sessions of continuous exercise into shorter bouts dispersed over the course of the day (42). Stamatakis et al. (43) recently proposed a framework encouraging four pillars of research to better understand the health benefits of a strategy called \u0093vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity\u0094 (VILPA). These authors define VILPA as a single session of vigorous activity (?14 or 15 on the Borg 6\u009620 scale or >6 MET) lasting no more than 5 min performed as part of activities of daily living or other lifestyle physical activities (43). Exercise snacks align closely with the VILPA framework in terms of their brevity, intensity, and accessibility but are technically distinct. First, unlike VILPA, exercise snacks are not purely incidental to, or inherently part of, activities of daily living but rather can be planned or structured within lifestyle activities \u0097 a distinction that still preserves the important aspects of feasibility and accessibility upon which VILPA is based. Exercise snacks also embody key elements of exercise that are not necessarily part of VILPA \u0097 namely, structure (?1 min in duration and performed as a hard effort), planning (required some anticipation or decision making), repetition (must be performed multiple times over the day), and intention (performed for the improvement of cardiometabolic health) \u0097 further distinguishing them from the VILPA approach. Nonetheless, it becomes somewhat difficult to delineate between a purposeful exercise snack embedded within activities of daily living \u0097 for instance, vigorously ascending the stairs to use the restroom on a different floor in an office building or performing a set of jumping jacks during a break between virtual meetings \u0097 and lifestyle approaches such as incidental VILPA (e.g., carrying groceries up several flights of stairs, maximizing walking pace to the bus stop). Relatedly, although exercise snacks are sometimes compared as a more practical alternative to SIT (17), the health benefits of exercise snacks do not require \u0093all out\u0094 efforts and can be achieved without the use of specialized cycle ergometers (15,16,18) \u0097 both of which are typical components of traditional SIT protocols. As such, we believe it is most appropriate to classify exercise snacks as a distinct subset of brief vigorous exercise (6), but we also recognize that \u0097 as with most things in science \u0097 the concept of exercise snacks proposed here is not necessarily new but rather may be an alternative iteration of an idea that has likely been presented by others in different contexts, both in the past and present.\n\nFUTURE DIRECTIONS\nWe have proposed a working definition of exercise snacks based on the existing literature, but also recognize the need to balance establishing a more standardized definition with the pragmaticism of avoiding hard cutoffs that draw the line at distinct intensities, durations, or numbers of isolated, short bouts of exercise within the exercise snacking concept. Ultimately, our intention is not to advocate for strictly defined terminology but rather to highlight the overall concept that isolated bouts of brief vigorous exercise represent an additional lifestyle approach to improve cardiometabolic health. With this in mind, it is entirely possible that others may view this approach as a physical activity strategy as opposed to an exercise protocol per se and, thus, choose to use terminology that differs from that implemented here (e.g., activity snacks). The decision to use the term \u0093exercise\u0094 (as opposed to \u0093activity\u0094) snacks for the purpose of this article was to maintain consistency with our published work in the area and because the approach presented in this article embodies key aspects of exercise in that it is planned, structured, repetitive, and intended for the purpose of improving cardiometabolic health. Other researchers have used variations of the term \u0093exercise snacks\u0094 to describe protocols that deviate slightly from our proposed definition but still may yield important benefits for cardiometabolic health (19,24,44). As such, the exact characteristics of exercise snacks required to maximize health benefits are yet to be determined, but it does seem that a single isolated daily 20-s sprint may not be sufficient to increase CRF in young healthy adults (45).\n\nA standardized definition could also help better understand this novel exercise approach given the similarities between exercise snacks and other forms of brief vigorous activity such as VILPA or low-volume SIT (6,43,46). However, characterizing the intensity, duration, or mode of exercise snacks based on established exercise prescription guidelines (e.g., American College of Sports Medicine, WHO) and principles (e.g., \u0093FITT\u0094) becomes difficult because of the short-duration, purposefully sporadic and isolated nature of this type of activity. For instance, it is possible that, when evaluating intensity using traditional metrics such as RPE, HR, or V?O2, exercise snacks may elicit values that are distinct from those observed during more common types of activity that established exercise prescription guidelines are based on. Thus, we encourage future attempts to classify exercise snacks in a manner that distinguishes them from existing physical activity and exercise paradigms and call for research validating traditional metrics for characterizing this type of activity.\n\nAnother aspect that is missing from the existing exercise snacks literature is their impact on psychological and affective responses, as these behavioral factors may be among the most important determinants of exercise participation. Little et al. (17) found no impact on exercise enjoyment after 6 wk of laboratory-based exercise snacks, but participants indicated the desire to perform exercise snacks in a \u0093real-world\u0094 setting. This again highlights the need to examine both physiological and psychological responses to exercise snacks outside the laboratory. In general, stair-based brief vigorous exercise seems to elicit favorable effects on cognition and mood in healthy young adults (47), but whether these beneficial effects persist using the exercise snacks approach as defined here remains to be determined. On a related note, qualitative measures that capture the feasibility of this approach in a setting where participants may not have adequate time or opportunity to prepare for intense activity during daily activities (e.g., by warming up or changing into active wear) should be assessed to rule out potential barriers to exercise snacks in the real world.\n\nGiven the relatively short duration and laboratory-based nature of existing exercise snacks studies, another important next step is to investigate the physiological and behavioral responses to longer exercise snacks interventions (e.g., several months to >1 year). Relatedly, as most of the existing research has involved healthy individuals, future studies should include populations at risk for cardiometabolic disease (e.g., preclinical/clinical populations, elderly individuals) to assess comprehensively the feasibility and efficacy of the exercise snacks approach. A plausible concern with the implementation of any vigorous exercise strategy in the real world is the potential of injury \u0097 particularly in at-risk or elderly populations. This highlights another outcome that should be addressed when attempting to translate exercise snacks outside the laboratory, albeit in a manner that balances the potential risk of injury with the numerous health benefits highlighted here and the detrimental effects of inactivity itself.\n\nLastly, the aerobically conditioning nature of the exercise snacks in the studies discussed here favor improvements in CRF, but the exercise snacks approach may be additionally attractive if geared toward improving muscular strength and endurance. A pilot study by Perkin et al. (24) reported improvements in functional capacity (sit to stand score) in older adults who participated in a 28-d home-based intervention involving two daily bouts of body weight exercise involving 5 \u00d7 1-min bouts of maximum repetitions. At the molecular level, brief vigorous bouts of stair climbing improved fiber-specific satellite cell content and myonuclei number as well as indices of capillarization in patients with coronary artery disease over a 12-wk period (33). However, because neither of these studies involved isolated bouts of exercise using an exercise snacks approach, whether these changes in muscle function and phenotype would manifest in response to exercise snacks requires confirmation in future work. Future research also should probe the mechanistic basis of the adaptive response to exercise snacks, which \u0097 similar to other forms of brief vigorous exercise \u0097 likely involves muscular oxidative remodeling mediated by activation of canonical intracellular signaling pathways (e.g., AMP-activated protein kinase) and transcriptional regulators (e.g., peroxisome proliferative activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha) (48\u009650).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe persistence of insufficient physical activity levels and sedentary lifestyles among the general population in modern Western societies highlights the ongoing need for feasible exercise strategies that simultaneously improve CRF and reduce the impact of sedentariness on cardiometabolic health. Based on the emerging evidence presented in this article, we propose that exercise snacks \u0097 defined here as isolated bouts of brief vigorous exercise performed multiple times throughout the day \u0097 may be one such strategy (Fig. 4). Exercise snacks involving thrice daily ~15\u009630 s of hard effort involving cycling and more practical stair climbing are efficacious for improving CRF and exercise performance in inactive adults. Exercise snacks may also have potential to improve aspects of cardiometabolic health in individuals with obesity, but their efficacy in clinical populations remains to be established as existing reports have studied a small number of participants in laboratory-based settings. Relatedly \u0097 and perhaps most importantly \u0097 the applicability of exercise snacks in a \u0093real-world\u0094 (e.g., in home-, office-, or work-based) setting and the potential for exercise snacks to target musculoskeletal health remain to be determined.", "folder": "text/2023-07-11 for db", "system_role": "You are a helpful assistant.", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 1000, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613", "qna": {"timestamp": "2023-07-11 23:35:33.993335-07:00", "reference_id": 3, "article_title": "Exercise Snacks A Novel Strategy to Improve Cardiometabolic Health", "text": "We define exercise snacks as isolated ?1-min bouts of vigorous exercise performed periodically throughout the day.

For each stair-based exercise snack, participants were instructed to safely ascend 60 steps in a three-flight stairwell as quickly as possible. Each exercise snack was preceded by a dynamic warm-up (10 jumping jacks, 10 air squats, and 5 lunges on each side) and followed by a 1-min walking cooldown. After the 6-wk intervention, there were modest, albeit significant, improvements in CRF as measured using cycling V?O2peak and peak power output in the exercise snacks group as compared with control (15). CRF and peak power output values in the exercise snacks group were ~5% and ~12% higher postintervention, respectively, as compared with baseline. Of note, the vigorous exercise snacks elicited mean RPE values corresponding to a \u0093hard\u0094 effort (5 \u00b1 1 on the Borg CR10 scale) and mean HR responses equating ~85% of the age-predicted maximum over the course of the training intervention (15).\n\nThe potential for exercise snacks to improve CRF (15) was confirmed in a study involving three isolated 20-s \u0093all-out\u0094 cycling bouts (each with a 2-min warm-up and 1-min cooldown) performed 1\u00964 h apart (17). V?O2peak and time-trial performance improved by ~4% and ~9%, respectively, over a 6-wk period in a group of 12 inactive adults (17). The CRF and performance gains with cycling-based exercise snacks seemed to be similar in magnitude to those observed in participants who were randomized to a traditional SIT protocol in this study, although the study was admittedly underpowered for between-group comparisons (Fig. 1). These results suggest that the vigorous nature of these protocols may be a more important adaptive stimulus than performing successive bouts of fatiguing exercise within a short period. In support of this supposition, an isolated 10-s sprint is sufficient to alter the concentration of intramuscular metabolites (27), and a 30-s sprint activates key intracellular signaling cascades involved in mediating training adaptation (e.g., adenosine monophosphate (AMP)\u0096activated protein kinase) (28). These findings extended earlier work in 18 middle-aged females demonstrating a ~14% improvement in V?O2peak when three isolated 30-s Wingate tests undertaken 4 h apart were performed thrice weekly over an 8-wk period (29).\n\nTaken together, evidence gleaned from the aforementioned studies suggests that vigorous exercise snacks are an effective strategy to improve CRF and indices of exercise performance in previously inactive adults. Despite participants in our studies still being considered physically inactive based on the recently revised Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (i.e., by completing exercise snacks, they would not necessarily achieve 150 min of moderate-intensity or 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both each week (30)), the CRF gains conferred by the exercise snacks approach would still be expected to have health benefits (2). Importantly, for the adoption of exercise snacks by the general population outside the laboratory, the CRF gains attained using the exercise snacks approach do not require all-out efforts (15) and are apparent using both cycling-based exercise snacks and a more practical stair-based snack protocol that can be easily implemented in a home-, school-, or office-based setting.\n\nTHE FEASIBILITY OF EXERCISE SNACKS IN PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL POPULATIONS\nSedentary behavior is linked to adverse metabolic outcomes independent of CRF and physical activity levels (3,10,11), and evidence from both observational and interventional studies supports the health benefits of interrupting sedentary time with bouts of low- to moderate-intensity physical activity such as walking (12\u009614). Although these strategies effectively mitigate the cardiometabolic health defects arising from sedentary behavior, practical lifestyle approaches that break up prolonged periods of inactivity while simultaneously improving in CRF in populations at risk for, or diagnosed with, cardiometabolic disease (e.g., type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease) are presently limited. Relatedly, a large proportion of individuals in this demographic are elderly and have low physical fitness levels or other disease-related risk factors that may prevent participation in traditional forms of exercise that are typically well suited for healthy adults. Thus, there is an urgent need for feasible exercise strategies that can effectively improve cardiometabolic health in these populations.\n\nRecent work from our laboratory supports the feasibility and efficacy of vigorous exercise snacks to disrupt prolonged periods of inactivity and improve cardiometabolic health markers in preclinical and clinical populations. Using a randomized crossover design, we demonstrated that breaking up 9 h of sitting with hourly bouts of vigorous stair-based exercise snacks (~15\u009630 s) significantly reduced the area under the curve for insulin by ~17% and nonesterified fatty acids by ~21% in 11 adults with overweight/obesity (Fig. 2) (16). Unlike our previous studies (15,17), we opted not to include a warm-up and cooldown in this study to capture what an exercise snack may look like in the real world. These preliminary findings are reinforced by a recent study from Wolfe et al. (31) that reported improvements in some measures of metabolic control when 8 h of continuous sitting was compared with a condition where participants performed 5 \u00d7 4-second maximal cycling sprints on a specialized ergometer, once per hour. Breaking up prolonged sitting with hourly sprints resulted in a ~31% reduction in postprandial plasma triglycerides and 43% increase in fat oxidation after the consumption of a high-fat meal on the morning after the experimental trial (31). The exercise protocol was not strictly an exercise snacks study per our definition here, however, because it involved a total of 20 s of maximal intensity cycling over ~4\u00965 min once per hour. Other reports also show the feasibility of short practical bouts of stair-based vigorous exercise in individuals with type 2 diabetes (32) and coronary artery disease (33,34), and research into the potential of exercise snacks for improving metabolic outcomes in clinical populations represents a promising avenue for future work. It will also be of interest to examine how the more vigorous exercise snacks approach discussed here compares to breaking up prolonged sitting with frequent light- to moderate-activity breaks \u0097 an approach that has previously demonstrated benefits for improving markers of metabolic control in individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes (12,14,20,35).\n\nTHE POTENTIAL FOR EXERCISE SNACKS TO IMPROVE VASCULAR HEALTH\nIn addition to causing metabolic disruptions, prolonged sitting also reduces leg blood flow and shear stress \u0097 factors implicated in endothelial dysfunction and the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (36,37). The detrimental effects of sedentary behavior on vascular function can be mitigated when exercise is undertaken before (38), during (39), or immediately after (40) an extended bout of prolonged sitting. In this regard, recent work from our laboratory also supports the potential for exercise snacks to improve vascular function during extended periods of sitting. Caldwell et al. (18) exposed 10 healthy males to ~8.5 h of sitting with or without hourly stair-based exercise snacks involving ~14\u009620 s of ascending three flights of stairs at a brisk speed. Significant improvements in femoral artery hemodynamics, but not flow-mediated dilation (FMD), were apparent when prolonged sitting was interrupted with hourly exercise snacks, as reflected by ~32% higher blood flow and vascular conductance and a ~15% increase in shear rate (18) (Fig. 3). Although we are unaware of other studies examining vascular function in response to the exercise snacks approach as defined here, our work is supported by recent observations of improved popliteal artery blood flow and shear rate in healthy adults when a postprandial 4-h sitting period is interrupted with hourly 5-min bouts of vigorous stair climbing (23). Notably, the longer stair climbing bouts used by Cho et al. (23) also offset the reduction in FMD during prolonged sitting, suggesting that longer acute bouts of exercise may be required to elicit favorable effects on this parameter of vascular function. Taken together, these findings support the potential of exercise snacks to favorably impact vascular health, although additional studies are required to confirm the findings presented here, particularly with regard to the effects of exercise snacks on vascular and endothelial function.\n\nWHERE DO EXERCISE SNACKS FIT IN?\nExercise snacks align with the recently revised Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines on Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior (30,41). In recognition of the potential health benefits of short bouts of physical activity, the updated recommendations from these and other organizations eliminated the previous requirement that physical activity had to be accumulated in bouts lasting at least 10-min minimum (30,41). In line with this recommendation, other work has demonstrated the maintenance of health benefits when splitting longer sessions of continuous exercise into shorter bouts dispersed over the course of the day (42). Stamatakis et al. (43) recently proposed a framework encouraging four pillars of research to better understand the health benefits of a strategy called \u0093vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity\u0094 (VILPA). These authors define VILPA as a single session of vigorous activity (?14 or 15 on the Borg 6\u009620 scale or >6 MET) lasting no more than 5 min performed as part of activities of daily living or other lifestyle physical activities (43). Exercise snacks align closely with the VILPA framework in terms of their brevity, intensity, and accessibility but are technically distinct. First, unlike VILPA, exercise snacks are not purely incidental to, or inherently part of, activities of daily living but rather can be planned or structured within lifestyle activities \u0097 a distinction that still preserves the important aspects of feasibility and accessibility upon which VILPA is based. Exercise snacks also embody key elements of exercise that are not necessarily part of VILPA \u0097 namely, structure (?1 min in duration and performed as a hard effort), planning (required some anticipation or decision making), repetition (must be performed multiple times over the day), and intention (performed for the improvement of cardiometabolic health) \u0097 further distinguishing them from the VILPA approach. Nonetheless, it becomes somewhat difficult to delineate between a purposeful exercise snack embedded within activities of daily living \u0097 for instance, vigorously ascending the stairs to use the restroom on a different floor in an office building or performing a set of jumping jacks during a break between virtual meetings \u0097 and lifestyle approaches such as incidental VILPA (e.g., carrying groceries up several flights of stairs, maximizing walking pace to the bus stop). Relatedly, although exercise snacks are sometimes compared as a more practical alternative to SIT (17), the health benefits of exercise snacks do not require \u0093all out\u0094 efforts and can be achieved without the use of specialized cycle ergometers (15,16,18) \u0097 both of which are typical components of traditional SIT protocols. As such, we believe it is most appropriate to classify exercise snacks as a distinct subset of brief vigorous exercise (6), but we also recognize that \u0097 as with most things in science \u0097 the concept of exercise snacks proposed here is not necessarily new but rather may be an alternative iteration of an idea that has likely been presented by others in different contexts, both in the past and present.\n\nFUTURE DIRECTIONS\nWe have proposed a working definition of exercise snacks based on the existing literature, but also recognize the need to balance establishing a more standardized definition with the pragmaticism of avoiding hard cutoffs that draw the line at distinct intensities, durations, or numbers of isolated, short bouts of exercise within the exercise snacking concept. Ultimately, our intention is not to advocate for strictly defined terminology but rather to highlight the overall concept that isolated bouts of brief vigorous exercise represent an additional lifestyle approach to improve cardiometabolic health. With this in mind, it is entirely possible that others may view this approach as a physical activity strategy as opposed to an exercise protocol per se and, thus, choose to use terminology that differs from that implemented here (e.g., activity snacks). The decision to use the term \u0093exercise\u0094 (as opposed to \u0093activity\u0094) snacks for the purpose of this article was to maintain consistency with our published work in the area and because the approach presented in this article embodies key aspects of exercise in that it is planned, structured, repetitive, and intended for the purpose of improving cardiometabolic health. Other researchers have used variations of the term \u0093exercise snacks\u0094 to describe protocols that deviate slightly from our proposed definition but still may yield important benefits for cardiometabolic health (19,24,44). As such, the exact characteristics of exercise snacks required to maximize health benefits are yet to be determined, but it does seem that a single isolated daily 20-s sprint may not be sufficient to increase CRF in young healthy adults (45).\n\nA standardized definition could also help better understand this novel exercise approach given the similarities between exercise snacks and other forms of brief vigorous activity such as VILPA or low-volume SIT (6,43,46). However, characterizing the intensity, duration, or mode of exercise snacks based on established exercise prescription guidelines (e.g., American College of Sports Medicine, WHO) and principles (e.g., \u0093FITT\u0094) becomes difficult because of the short-duration, purposefully sporadic and isolated nature of this type of activity. For instance, it is possible that, when evaluating intensity using traditional metrics such as RPE, HR, or V?O2, exercise snacks may elicit values that are distinct from those observed during more common types of activity that established exercise prescription guidelines are based on. Thus, we encourage future attempts to classify exercise snacks in a manner that distinguishes them from existing physical activity and exercise paradigms and call for research validating traditional metrics for characterizing this type of activity.\n\nAnother aspect that is missing from the existing exercise snacks literature is their impact on psychological and affective responses, as these behavioral factors may be among the most important determinants of exercise participation. Little et al. (17) found no impact on exercise enjoyment after 6 wk of laboratory-based exercise snacks, but participants indicated the desire to perform exercise snacks in a \u0093real-world\u0094 setting. This again highlights the need to examine both physiological and psychological responses to exercise snacks outside the laboratory. In general, stair-based brief vigorous exercise seems to elicit favorable effects on cognition and mood in healthy young adults (47), but whether these beneficial effects persist using the exercise snacks approach as defined here remains to be determined. On a related note, qualitative measures that capture the feasibility of this approach in a setting where participants may not have adequate time or opportunity to prepare for intense activity during daily activities (e.g., by warming up or changing into active wear) should be assessed to rule out potential barriers to exercise snacks in the real world.\n\nGiven the relatively short duration and laboratory-based nature of existing exercise snacks studies, another important next step is to investigate the physiological and behavioral responses to longer exercise snacks interventions (e.g., several months to >1 year). Relatedly, as most of the existing research has involved healthy individuals, future studies should include populations at risk for cardiometabolic disease (e.g., preclinical/clinical populations, elderly individuals) to assess comprehensively the feasibility and efficacy of the exercise snacks approach. A plausible concern with the implementation of any vigorous exercise strategy in the real world is the potential of injury \u0097 particularly in at-risk or elderly populations. This highlights another outcome that should be addressed when attempting to translate exercise snacks outside the laboratory, albeit in a manner that balances the potential risk of injury with the numerous health benefits highlighted here and the detrimental effects of inactivity itself.\n\nLastly, the aerobically conditioning nature of the exercise snacks in the studies discussed here favor improvements in CRF, but the exercise snacks approach may be additionally attractive if geared toward improving muscular strength and endurance. A pilot study by Perkin et al. (24) reported improvements in functional capacity (sit to stand score) in older adults who participated in a 28-d home-based intervention involving two daily bouts of body weight exercise involving 5 \u00d7 1-min bouts of maximum repetitions. At the molecular level, brief vigorous bouts of stair climbing improved fiber-specific satellite cell content and myonuclei number as well as indices of capillarization in patients with coronary artery disease over a 12-wk period (33). However, because neither of these studies involved isolated bouts of exercise using an exercise snacks approach, whether these changes in muscle function and phenotype would manifest in response to exercise snacks requires confirmation in future work. Future research also should probe the mechanistic basis of the adaptive response to exercise snacks, which \u0097 similar to other forms of brief vigorous exercise \u0097 likely involves muscular oxidative remodeling mediated by activation of canonical intracellular signaling pathways (e.g., AMP-activated protein kinase) and transcriptional regulators (e.g., peroxisome proliferative activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha) (48\u009650).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe persistence of insufficient physical activity levels and sedentary lifestyles among the general population in modern Western societies highlights the ongoing need for feasible exercise strategies that simultaneously improve CRF and reduce the impact of sedentariness on cardiometabolic health. Based on the emerging evidence presented in this article, we propose that exercise snacks \u0097 defined here as isolated bouts of brief vigorous exercise performed multiple times throughout the day \u0097 may be one such strategy (Fig. 4). Exercise snacks involving thrice daily ~15\u009630 s of hard effort involving cycling and more practical stair climbing are efficacious for improving CRF and exercise performance in inactive adults. Exercise snacks may also have potential to improve aspects of cardiometabolic health in individuals with obesity, but their efficacy in clinical populations remains to be established as existing reports have studied a small number of participants in laboratory-based settings. Relatedly \u0097 and perhaps most importantly \u0097 the applicability of exercise snacks in a \u0093real-world\u0094 (e.g., in home-, office-, or work-based) setting and the potential for exercise snacks to target musculoskeletal health remain to be determined.", "system_role": "You are a helpful assistant.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613", "prep_step": "In the summary, cover the following information:     \n- Identify the key points and statistics from this text that would make interesting or helpful health content.     \n- If available, include the effect sizes found in the research.
