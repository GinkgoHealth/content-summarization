Discussion
Results of this study indicated no differences in the recovery response between YA and MA for any of the performance measures, nor in subjective levels of muscle pain or soreness. Furthermore, no between-group differences were observed in the inflammatory or muscle damage response to the exercise protocol. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine differences in the recovery response from high-volume resistance exercise between recreationally trained young and middle-aged adults. Our results comparing BL performance measures seem to be in agreement with other investigations, demonstrating differences in strength measures between young (2329 years) and older adults (6065 years) (7,15,24), and between middle-aged (4142 years) and older adults (7072 years) (17,18). It does seem that the decline in strength may develop during middle age. However, recovery from exercise seems to be comparable in both younger and middle-aged adults as reflected by similar changes in performance and markers of muscle damage and inflammation. Although changes in strength may occur in middle age, recovery from exercise does seem to be maintained in recreationally trained individuals.
The differences observed at BL in isometric force and the rate of force development is consistent with other investigations comparing younger and older adults (16,19,36). Although differences in age between young and middle-aged adults do seem to affect BL levels of strength, it does not seem to affect recovery from exercise. This is supported by similar patterns of muscle damage and inflammation observed during the recovery period after the HVP. Elevations in Mb and CK concentrations are consistent with the expected physiological response from a bout of resistance exercise (9,34). These results also suggest that middle-aged recreationally active men who regularly engage in resistance training do not seem to be at increased risk for greater soreness or muscle damage in comparison with younger recreationally trained men.
Similar response patterns were also noted in the inflammatory response for both groups. No significant elevations from BL were observed in CRP. However, significant increases in IL-6 concentrations were observed for both groups. Although CRP is an acute phase protein whose function is to activate the innate immune response and enhance phagocytosis (10), it does not seem to change after an acute bout of resistance exercise (6). Previous research has reported no significant changes in CRP concentrations after resistance training protocols recruiting primarily both upper-body (31) and lower-body exercises (4) in younger men. Furthermore, previous investigations have also indicated that training experience can reduce the CRP response to an acute bout of exercise (22,35). Considering that participants in both YA and MA were recreationally trained, it is likely that this training experience may have attenuated the CRP response. Physiologically, it is consistent with the lower stress and damage that occurs with repetitive training (9,35). Interleukin-6 is an inflammatory cytokine that facilitates communication for the mobilization, proliferation, and differentiation of immune cells to the site of tissue damage (6) and has been shown to increase after exercise (11). Elevations in IL-6 are related to the intensity, duration, and mode of training (11,13,32), but the literature is inconclusive regarding the IL-6 response to resistance training. A recent study reported that a bout of high-volume resistance exercise (8 sets of 10 repetitions with 70% of maximal strength in the squat exercise) resulted in a significant elevation in IL-6 concentrations 30 min after exercise, but no changes were observed after a bout of high-intensity resistance exercise (8 sets of 3 repetitions with 90% of maximal strength in the squat exercise) in experienced, trained lifters (4). The IL-6 response observed during this investigation as a result of a bout of high-volume resistance exercise seems to be consistent with that recently reported by Bartolomei et al. (4). However, age did not seem to exacerbate nor attenuate the IL-6 response in recreationally trained participants.
No differences were noted in the inflammatory or muscle damage response between YA and MA. As discussed earlier, this is likely related to the recreational training background of the participants. However, there were several limitations to the study that need to be acknowledged. The exercise protocol was performed on an isokinetic dynamometer, which may not have as much practical application as most resistance training programs use dynamic constant resistance exercises. In addition, unilateral, single-joint exercise recruited a relatively smaller muscle mass than is commonly used in most training programs. The use of this modality of exercise, which has been demonstrated to be very effective in eliciting muscle damage (20,30), may not have been sufficient to elicit significant performance and inflammatory changes in these recreationally trained participants. Future research should examine modes of training specific to the typical training program of the participants.
Practical Applications
The results of this study indicate that changes in muscle performance seem to begin during middle age, even in recreationally trained individuals. However, participating in recreational resistance training may mitigate any alteration in the recovery response from exercise. These results should be examined in the context that recovery was investigated after a unilateral, single-joint isokinetic exercise protocol. Although this method has been previously used as an effective mode of exercise to elicit muscle damage, it is not specific to the type of exercises typically used by recreational lifters. Future studies may wish to compare these population groups using multijoint, dynamic constant resistance exercises common to the training programs of most recreational lifters, regardless of age.",Summarize the text for a LinkedIn post.,"In the summary, cover the following information:

2023-06-20 1441,text/2023-06-20 discussion,Effect of dietary sources of calcium and protein on hip fractures and falls in older adults in residential care cluster randomised controlled trial,1,You are a helpful assistant.,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,"Effect of dietary sources of calcium and protein on hip fractures and falls in older adults in residential care cluster randomised controlled trial
Discussion
This nutritional approach using high calcium and high protein dairy foods to increase calcium and protein intakes in institutionalised older adults replete in vitamin D was associated with a 33% reduction in risk of fractures of any type, a 46% reduction in risk of hip fractures, and an 11% reduction in risk of falls relative to controls. We found no group difference in all cause mortality.
Most interventions aimed at reducing fracture risk target a drug therapy to people with osteoporosis because they are at high risk of fracture. This approach confers a large benefit to the individual and does so cost effectively, because few people need to be treated to avert one event. However, averting fractures in small numbers of people at high risk does not reduce the burden of fractures in the community.
The population burden of fracturesthe number of events, morbidity, mortality, and cost to the communityarises from the vast numbers of people with risk factors that confer a modest attributable risk to the individual.17 For example, most fragility fractures in the community arise among women with osteopenia (bone mineral density T score 2.5 to 1 SD) because they form the largest segment of the community.18 Likewise, most fractures attributable to nutritional inadequacy arise among the great many people with intakes of calcium and protein that are below recommended levels.19 This nutritional inadequacy confers a small attributable risk to the individual but accounts for a large attributable fraction of the fracture burden in the community as a whole. This is the Geoffrey Rose prevention paradoxa community based approach producing a small benefit to an individual may still confer a large benefit to the community.17 Safety is essential because most individuals treated may derive little or no benefit from the intervention. For example, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension study reduced blood pressure by replacing a western diet with a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, and low fat dairy foodsan approach associated with fewer cardiovascular events.20
Comparison with other studies
Most nutrition based studies assessing antifracture efficacy in aged care residents and people in the community used pharmacological doses of calcium with or without vitamin D.21 In a meta-analysis of 17 of these studies, only two studies reported a reduction in fracture riska study of nursing home residents with calcium intakes <600 mg/day and vitamin D concentrations <50 nmol/L and a community based study in women and men ?65 years of age with mean calcium intakes of 700 mg/day.21 In the remaining 15 studies, poor compliance, large numbers of dropouts, and a low prevalence of the risk factor may have contributed to the null findings.2223 Benefits are unlikely if the prevalence of a risk factor (such as inadequate calcium and protein intakes) is low.24 For example, in the meta-analysis, reduction in fracture risk reported with treatment was confined to the 7272 individuals with calcium intakes <700 mg/day (risk ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.89), not the 45?241 individuals with calcium intakes above 700 mg daily.21 The reduction in fracture risk observed with calcium and protein rich foods in this study may have been the result of attention to several of the above factors. Compliance was optimised by supervised provision and consumption of the foods. Participants lost to follow-up were replaced by newly admitted residents. We intentionally targeted a cohort at high risk for fracture in whom low calcium and protein intakes were common and so were likely to partly contribute to the already high fracture burden in this community.
Mechanisms of fracture risk reduction
This nutritional intervention produced two unanticipated novel observations. The risk reduction for falls and fractures was detected by three and five months, respectively, and the relative risk reduction for fractures was similar to that found in trials using potent antiresorptive therapy to treat people at high risk due to osteoporosis. The two most likely explanations for each of these observations is a risk reduction for falls and slowing progression of bone fragility. Insulin-like growth factor 1 increased in the intervention group only, whereas the decrease in appendicular lean mass was confined to controls, consistent with the notion that protein intakes of 1-1.5 g/kg/day is needed to prevent protein catabolism and preserve or increase muscle mass in older adults, particularly those at risk of malnutrition or frailty.25 The increase in serum C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and deterioration in tibial and radial total volumetric bone mineral density in controls was not seen in the intervention group, consistent with slowing of bone loss and slowing of microstructural deterioration.26 These changes were modest, but slowing microstructural deterioration disproportionately reduces progression of bone fragility because fragility increases as a power function to the bone loss producing it.27
Mortality did not differ between the groups. Some, but not all, studies suggest that milk consumption is associated with increased mortality but consumption of yoghurt and cheese (fermented foods) with reduced mortality and favourable blood lipid profiles.282930 Fermented and non-fermented dairy foods were used during the intervention. Milk consumption did not differ between the intervention and control groups (data not shown).",Summarize the text for a LinkedIn post.,"In the summary, cover the following information:

DISCUSSION
This preliminary study is the first to directly compare the effects of both food cue and stress exposure on HP food craving and HP food intake in a 3-day human laboratory experiment conducted within a controlled hospital-based setting with healthy community adults. As both the ubiquitous HP food environment and stressors are known to increase HP food intake and obesity risk, a direct comparison of these contexts could identify similar and differential processes that may underlie food motivation and intake. As hypothesized, and similar to our previous work in addiction [18], we found that exposure to both personal food cues and to personal stressors relative to a neutral relaxing control cue resulted in increases in HP food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods in a standardized Food Snack Test (FST), but with differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups. Furthermore, we found that increased food craving in these contexts was highly associated with subsequent amounts of HP food snack intake. Finally, both ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. Together, these results support the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.
Exposure to food cue imagery led to significant increases in HP food craving prior to the presentation of the FST at the pre-snack timepoint in both lean and OW individuals. Moreover, food cue-related increases in food craving predicted significant increases in HP snack intake across both lean and OW individuals. These data are consistent with a significant literature indicating that rewarding stimuli and their related contexts increase motivation and wanting of rewarding stimuli via conditioning and/or incentive salience mechanisms [4, 20, 42]. Also, a number of basic science and human neuroimaging studies have shown that food cue stimulus exposure increases food craving and activate brain reward and motivation regions [4, 7-11, 18, 43, 44]. Current findings further indicate that such food cue-related increases in HP food craving promote HP snack intake with greater intake of HP foods in the food cue context relative to the neutral relaxing contexts across individuals. These data validate the real-world contexts of advertising of HP foods to promote greater sales and intake of HP foods.
In contrast, we found a differential impact of stress on HP food craving and intake by BMI group where stress significantly increased food craving relative to the neutral condition, but only in the overweight and not the lean group. Furthermore, stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group, suggesting that food motivational processes may be relevant in identifying those who are vulnerable to stress-induced eating. Previous laboratory studies have shown mixed results with some showing stress increasing food intake [17, 24], but others reporting no consistent increases in intake [23, 45]. While the methodology has varied across these studies, current findings suggest the need for direct comparison of BMI groups and consideration of weight-related adaptations in assessing stress effects on HP food motivation and intake. Current findings are also supported by a growing literature suggesting that BMI-related alterations impact not only metabolic hormones but also stress and reward processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake [18, 20, 44]. Together our findings on food cue- and stress- related effects on HP food motivation and intake suggests differential effects by BMI, that may in turn, point to different mechanisms that may drive weight gain and obesity risk in individuals who are lean versus those who are overweight.
Our findings also show differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin responses and their contribution to HP food motivation and intake. Stress and food cue exposure increased ghrelin responses, but significantly for the OW and not the LN group. Furthermore, only in the OW group was stress-induced ghrelin increases significantly associated with both HP food craving and subsequent HP food intake. While ghrelin has well known homeostatic effects on feeding function [46, 47], recent focus has been on its role in both stress and mood regulation as well as in hedonically motivated feeding behavior, partially via its effects on mesolimbic reward circuits [37, 48]. Findings indicate that ghrelin can shift preferences to high palatable foods and increase the motivational aspects of food reward [48]. Ghrelin is also known to increase with stress and is involved in regulating anxiety and mood (36, 49-51). Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that ghrelin administration increases the neural response to food pictures in areas associated with hedonic eating (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and ventral tegmental area) [52]. Additionally, there is growing evidence that feed-forward circuitry between stress and food reward maybe partly mediated by ghrelin [52, 53]. In the current study, as the effects were specific to the OW group, they suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions.
Finally, our findings also showed differential effects of cortisol responses to stress and food cue exposure. Notably, there was a significant increase in cortisol in the food cue relative to the neutral condition that was due to significant increases in cortisol in the lean group and not so in the OW group. Furthermore, food cue-related increases in cortisol was associated with greater food cue-related HP craving, suggesting a role for cortisol in food motivation. While glucocorticoids are often associated with the stress response, they are also known to play an important role in energy intake and regulation. Cortisol increases have been noted with intake of specific macronutrients, including carbohydrates, fats and proteins in animals and humans [6, 54], with the source of cortisol increases to be via both adrenal and extra-adrenal production [54]. Furthermore, in our previous neuroimaging study, increases in cortisol during a mild hypoglycemic state was associated with greater activation of brain reward regions that promoted greater food craving [44]. Together, this previous research supports current findings of the association between greater cortisol responses to food cue exposure with food cue-induced HP food craving.
We did not see an overall significant increase in cortisol during stress exposure, but this was largely due to a lack of response in the OW group. Remarkably, the OW group showed blunted cortisol responses during stress and food cue relative to neutral conditions. This finding is consistent with growing evidence of blunted cortisol and autonomic responses to stress challenge in people who are OW or obese, along with altered autonomic and peripheral catecholamine responses to stress challenge in those weight groups [18, 21-25, 55]. HPA axis adaptations with low cortisol awakening responses have been reported in higher BMI groups, along with blunted responses to stress and reduced dopamine activity [20, 56]. Thus, the current findings of lack of cortisol increases in the OW group leads one to speculate that such HPA axis adaptations may contribute to higher HP food craving and intake in food cue and in stress contexts. However, this is speculation and would need further testing in future studies.
Several limitations of the current study need to be considered. First, the sample size was small and thus the findings are preliminary and need further validation. Also, due to the small sample size, sex differences and differential responses within the overweight groups were not assessed. It is possible that men and women differ in their food motivation and intake responses in food cue and stress contexts as shown in previous work [26,27]. Also, continuous assessment of BMI rather than arbitrary cutoffs for individuals in the lean, overweight and obese BMI range may provide greater sensitivity in assessing weight related adaptations. Thus, research with larger samples is required to replicate current findings and address these issues. Finally, as this study was conducted while participants were in a hospital, it is not clear whether the findings are generalizable to an outpatient experimental context or to real world food motivation and intake settings. On the other hand, as food cues and stress are among the most common contexts in which overeating of HP foods occur in the real world, the current study presents a well-controlled experimental model to study the biobehavioral processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake of highly palatable foods. Evidence of HP food motivation and increased snacking in these contexts is consistent with reports of obesogenic environments promoting increased HP food intake and weight gain in the real world. Furthermore, positive associations of HP food craving and intake by total ghrelin and cortisol responses suggests a role for metabolic and neuroendocrine adaptations in increased HP food motivation and intake.

DISCUSSION
This study examined the independent and combined effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in healthy eumenorrheic women, and the potential efficacy of acute water ingestion as a remedy to the deleterious impact of hypohydration. The main findings were that: 1) mild hypohydration increased pain sensitivity, 2) menstrual phase did not affect pain sensitivity, nor did it influence the effect of hypohydration on pain, and 3) acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity.

Hypohydration and Pain in Women
Independent of menstrual phase, mild hypohydration following 24 h of fluid restriction reduced pain tolerance (?8%) and increased pain intensity (+13%) and pain unpleasantness (+12%) ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (hereafter referred to as pain ratings) during ischemic pain stimulation, when compared with euhydration. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies that showed negative effects of mild hypohydration on experimental pain sensitivity in men (7, 8). Ogino et al. (7) observed a decrease in pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) following a combination of exercise-induced dehydration and fluid restriction, whereas Bear et al. (8) found an increase in pain intensity ratings but no difference in pain thresholds after 24 h of fluid restriction. Therefore, the current findings extend these previous results to women by showing that mild hypohydration also increases experimental pain sensitivity in women. The previous studies also did not include pain measures that reflect the affective/emotional experience of pain (i.e., pain tolerance or pain unpleasantness ratings) that may be important for chronic pain, whereas both pain threshold and pain intensity ratings assess the sensory/discriminative aspect of pain (49, 50). Although Bear et al. (8) measured pain tolerance, the nature of the stimulus-response relationship for the cold pressor taski.e., plateau and gradual decline in the perceived intensity of the pain stimulus (41)resulted in a large proportion (?2/3) of participants who were able to tolerate the pain until the 4-min cut-off time, thereby precluding meaningful analyses of the results. This issue was not apparent with the ischemic pain test used in the present study, as there was only one instance where the 20-min time limit was reached. Therefore, the current findings further add to the previous data by showing that mild hypohydration also negatively impacts the affective/emotional aspect of pain, as evidenced by the decrease in pain tolerance and increase in pain unpleasantness ratings compared with EUH.

The exact mechanisms underlying the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration cannot be determined from the current data. However, one potential mechanism through which hypohydration may increase pain sensitivity is thirst perception. Geuter et al. (51) showed that an increase in thirst perceptioninduced by consumption of salty snacks followed by 5 h of fluid deprivationled to an increase in pain intensity ratings during noxious heat stimulation, whereas subsequent ad libitum fluid intake, which reduced thirst perception, decreased pain ratings. In another study, stimulation of thirst sensation via hypertonic saline infusion increased pain intensity ratings during noxious pressure stimulation, which were associated with stronger activation of pain-related brain regions; namely, the anterior cingulate cortex and insula (52). Similar findings were reported in the study by Ogino et al. (7). These brain regions were previously shown to be activated and deactivated independently by an increase and decrease in thirst perception, respectively (5254). However, it is not apparent from these data whether the increased pain sensitivity and pain-related brain activity were due to thirst perception per se, physiological hypohydration, or both.

Menstrual Phase and Experimental Pain Sensitivity
Menstrual phase did not modulate the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration, nor did it independently affect pain sensitivity. The lack of a menstrual phase effect on ischemic pain sensitivity is consistent with the findings of most previous studies that examined ischemic pain responses across the menstrual cycle (18, 5558). In contrast, studies by Fillingim et al. (59) and Pfleeger et al. (60) observed greater pain sensitivity during the luteal compared with follicular phase. However, concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone were not measured in the study by Pfleeger et al. (60), whereas the specific definition of the luteal phase used by Fillingim et al. (59) differed from that in the current study. We examined the ML phase when concentrations of both 17?-estradiol and progesterone are elevated, whereas Fillingim et al. (59) included the late-luteal period in their classification of the luteal phase, during which concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone are declining rapidly and are less stable compared with the ML phase. Given that menstrual phases characterized by fluctuating or unstable 17?-estradiol levels have been associated with increased severity of various chronic pain conditions (14), this may explain why Fillingim et al. (59) observed phase differences in pain sensitivity whereas we did not.

The equivocal and inconclusive results regarding menstrual phase effects on experimental pain sensitivity are thought to be due, in part, to the lack of proper verification of menstrual phases through blood measurements of 17?-estradiol and progesterone (15, 16), making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relationship between menstrual phase/hormone status and pain sensitivity. Similar to previous observations (22, 23), Sosm was lower in the ML than EF phase (Table 2); however, this phase difference in hydration did not appear to impact any of the ischemic pain measures (Figs. 13). In this study, we showed that after hydration status was controlled, menstrual phases were properly verified and potential confounders (e.g., dietary and lifestyle factors and dysmenorrhea) were minimized, there was no difference in ischemic pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases. As such, our data suggest that the hormonal fluctuations within the menstrual cycle do not greatly impact pain sensitivity.

Interestingly, although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phase, there was a positive correlation between 17?-estradiol and pain sensitivity, suggesting that women with higher baseline levels of 17?-estradiol may be more sensitive to pain than those with lower 17?-estradiol levels (i.e., between-subject effect). However, given the weak strength of the correlation (r = ?0.32) (48), this finding should be interpreted with caution.

Effects of Acute Water Ingestion
Given that thirst perception may be a potential mechanism linking hypohydration and increased pain sensitivity, we hypothesized that acute water ingestion when hypohydrated would reduce pain sensitivity. This would also help to delineate the effects of thirst and hypohydration per se, on pain, since acute water ingestion would be expected to reduce thirst without altering hydration status (38, 61). However, contrary to our hypothesis, ischemic pain tolerance was not affected by ingestion of 5 mL·kg?1 of water, despite the significant decrease in thirst perception ratings. Meanwhile, ratings of both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness increased, which may appear counterintuitive as participants reported feeling more pain despite being less thirsty. These unexpected findings may be explained by carryover (sensitization) effects from the baseline pain test. A previous study showed that repeated pain stimulation within a single session produced a sensitization effect, whereby pain ratings increased gradually with each repeated stimulation (62). Therefore, this sensitization effect may have masked potential positive effects of acute water ingestion on pain. Future studies that either utilize a longer interval between the repeated pain tests, or perform the postwater ingestion pain test on a separate day, are required to gain further understanding on the relative importance of thirst perception and physiological hypohydration on pain.

Considerations
There are several considerations and limitations of this study that should be noted in addition to those already discussed earlier. First, only healthy, eumenorrheic women were included in this study, which ignores postmenopausal women and oral contraceptive pill users, who have different hormonal profiles compared with eumenorrheic women. Therefore, it is possible that hypohydration may affect pain sensitivity differently in these women compared with eumenorrheic women. Second, blood samples were not obtained after water ingestion to confirm that hydration status was not altered. However, previous data indicate that consuming a moderate volume of water, similar to that in the current study, does not acutely alter hydration status in hypohydrated men (38, 61). In addition, the relatively short interval of 30 min between water ingestion and the subsequent pain test was likely insufficient for hydration status to be altered, because a previous study showed that at least 75 min is required for 300 mL of water to be completely absorbed into the bloodstream (63). Third, as participants could not be blinded to the hydration intervention, the increased pain sensitivity observed during HYPO may have been confounded by nocebo effects (64, 65). Although participants were not aware of the study hypotheses, they were aware of the aims of the study, one of which was to investigate the effects of hypohydration on pain sensitivity. Given the negative connotations of hypohydration or dehydration, it is conceivable that participants would expect hypohydration to increase pain sensitivity, which may have subsequently influenced participants actual responses to the ischemic pain test. Fourth, the body mass change values in HYPO may not accurately reflect the fluid losses induced by the 24 h of fluid restriction. Due to the scheduling constraints that included two experimental visits within 3 days per menstrual phase, we were unable to obtain a baseline body mass at the start of the hydration intervention; thus, body mass change in HYPO was calculated using EUH body mass. As the EUH and HYPO trials within each menstrual phase were separated by at least 48 h, it is likely that the values were confounded by factors other than the change in body water content (e.g., urine and fecal losses, food and fluid consumption). Acknowledging this limitation, we obtained other measures of hydration status (i.e., Sosm, USG, copeptin, and thirst ratings) in addition to body mass change for a more accurate assessment of hydrations status. Finally, our sample size may have limited our ability to detect statistically significant menstrual phase effects on pain. As such, the effects of menstrual phase on pain require further investigation. Our study could provide a reference for future studies with a similar design to base their sample size calculations on. Nevertheless, large effect sizes (?2p
 = 0.370.55) were obtained for the main effect of hypohydration on pain, with an observed power of 0.70.9, which suggests a low probability of false negatives.

Perspectives and Significance
Our data indicate that hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women and this effect may not be reversed immediately by water ingestion. Whereas, menstrual phase (EF vs. ML) does not appear to affect pain sensitivity. These findings suggest that insufficient water intake throughout the day may exacerbate pain perception in healthy women. Given the high prevalence of hypohydration among the general population (25), future studies should investigate whether hypohydration may worsen chronic pain conditions, and the potential efficacy of maintaining adequate hydration in alleviating pain symptoms. This may be especially important for older adults, who are more likely to be hypohydrated and experience chronic pain (25, 66). For human pain researchers, controlling or measuring hydration status of participants may be important to minimize confound, as clinically and physiologically relevant tests such as the cold pressor are affected (67). Although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases after controlling for hydration status, more high-quality research is required to accurately determine whether menstrual phase does or does not affect pain sensitivity. Therefore, until a consensus on the topic has been reached, our data do not discount the need for future pain researchers to verify menstrual phase.",Summarize the text for a LinkedIn post.,"In the summary, cover the following information:

DISCUSSION
This study examined the independent and combined effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in healthy eumenorrheic women, and the potential efficacy of acute water ingestion as a remedy to the deleterious impact of hypohydration. The main findings were that: 1) mild hypohydration increased pain sensitivity, 2) menstrual phase did not affect pain sensitivity, nor did it influence the effect of hypohydration on pain, and 3) acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity.

Hypohydration and Pain in Women
Independent of menstrual phase, mild hypohydration following 24 h of fluid restriction reduced pain tolerance (?8%) and increased pain intensity (+13%) and pain unpleasantness (+12%) ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (hereafter referred to as pain ratings) during ischemic pain stimulation, when compared with euhydration. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies that showed negative effects of mild hypohydration on experimental pain sensitivity in men (7, 8). Ogino et al. (7) observed a decrease in pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) following a combination of exercise-induced dehydration and fluid restriction, whereas Bear et al. (8) found an increase in pain intensity ratings but no difference in pain thresholds after 24 h of fluid restriction. Therefore, the current findings extend these previous results to women by showing that mild hypohydration also increases experimental pain sensitivity in women. The previous studies also did not include pain measures that reflect the affective/emotional experience of pain (i.e., pain tolerance or pain unpleasantness ratings) that may be important for chronic pain, whereas both pain threshold and pain intensity ratings assess the sensory/discriminative aspect of pain (49, 50). Although Bear et al. (8) measured pain tolerance, the nature of the stimulus-response relationship for the cold pressor taski.e., plateau and gradual decline in the perceived intensity of the pain stimulus (41)resulted in a large proportion (?2/3) of participants who were able to tolerate the pain until the 4-min cut-off time, thereby precluding meaningful analyses of the results. This issue was not apparent with the ischemic pain test used in the present study, as there was only one instance where the 20-min time limit was reached. Therefore, the current findings further add to the previous data by showing that mild hypohydration also negatively impacts the affective/emotional aspect of pain, as evidenced by the decrease in pain tolerance and increase in pain unpleasantness ratings compared with EUH.

The exact mechanisms underlying the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration cannot be determined from the current data. However, one potential mechanism through which hypohydration may increase pain sensitivity is thirst perception. Geuter et al. (51) showed that an increase in thirst perceptioninduced by consumption of salty snacks followed by 5 h of fluid deprivationled to an increase in pain intensity ratings during noxious heat stimulation, whereas subsequent ad libitum fluid intake, which reduced thirst perception, decreased pain ratings. In another study, stimulation of thirst sensation via hypertonic saline infusion increased pain intensity ratings during noxious pressure stimulation, which were associated with stronger activation of pain-related brain regions; namely, the anterior cingulate cortex and insula (52). Similar findings were reported in the study by Ogino et al. (7). These brain regions were previously shown to be activated and deactivated independently by an increase and decrease in thirst perception, respectively (5254). However, it is not apparent from these data whether the increased pain sensitivity and pain-related brain activity were due to thirst perception per se, physiological hypohydration, or both.

Menstrual Phase and Experimental Pain Sensitivity
Menstrual phase did not modulate the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration, nor did it independently affect pain sensitivity. The lack of a menstrual phase effect on ischemic pain sensitivity is consistent with the findings of most previous studies that examined ischemic pain responses across the menstrual cycle (18, 5558). In contrast, studies by Fillingim et al. (59) and Pfleeger et al. (60) observed greater pain sensitivity during the luteal compared with follicular phase. However, concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone were not measured in the study by Pfleeger et al. (60), whereas the specific definition of the luteal phase used by Fillingim et al. (59) differed from that in the current study. We examined the ML phase when concentrations of both 17?-estradiol and progesterone are elevated, whereas Fillingim et al. (59) included the late-luteal period in their classification of the luteal phase, during which concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone are declining rapidly and are less stable compared with the ML phase. Given that menstrual phases characterized by fluctuating or unstable 17?-estradiol levels have been associated with increased severity of various chronic pain conditions (14), this may explain why Fillingim et al. (59) observed phase differences in pain sensitivity whereas we did not.

The equivocal and inconclusive results regarding menstrual phase effects on experimental pain sensitivity are thought to be due, in part, to the lack of proper verification of menstrual phases through blood measurements of 17?-estradiol and progesterone (15, 16), making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relationship between menstrual phase/hormone status and pain sensitivity. Similar to previous observations (22, 23), Sosm was lower in the ML than EF phase (Table 2); however, this phase difference in hydration did not appear to impact any of the ischemic pain measures (Figs. 13). In this study, we showed that after hydration status was controlled, menstrual phases were properly verified and potential confounders (e.g., dietary and lifestyle factors and dysmenorrhea) were minimized, there was no difference in ischemic pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases. As such, our data suggest that the hormonal fluctuations within the menstrual cycle do not greatly impact pain sensitivity.

Interestingly, although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phase, there was a positive correlation between 17?-estradiol and pain sensitivity, suggesting that women with higher baseline levels of 17?-estradiol may be more sensitive to pain than those with lower 17?-estradiol levels (i.e., between-subject effect). However, given the weak strength of the correlation (r = ?0.32) (48), this finding should be interpreted with caution.

Effects of Acute Water Ingestion
Given that thirst perception may be a potential mechanism linking hypohydration and increased pain sensitivity, we hypothesized that acute water ingestion when hypohydrated would reduce pain sensitivity. This would also help to delineate the effects of thirst and hypohydration per se, on pain, since acute water ingestion would be expected to reduce thirst without altering hydration status (38, 61). However, contrary to our hypothesis, ischemic pain tolerance was not affected by ingestion of 5 mL·kg?1 of water, despite the significant decrease in thirst perception ratings. Meanwhile, ratings of both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness increased, which may appear counterintuitive as participants reported feeling more pain despite being less thirsty. These unexpected findings may be explained by carryover (sensitization) effects from the baseline pain test. A previous study showed that repeated pain stimulation within a single session produced a sensitization effect, whereby pain ratings increased gradually with each repeated stimulation (62). Therefore, this sensitization effect may have masked potential positive effects of acute water ingestion on pain. Future studies that either utilize a longer interval between the repeated pain tests, or perform the postwater ingestion pain test on a separate day, are required to gain further understanding on the relative importance of thirst perception and physiological hypohydration on pain.

Considerations
There are several considerations and limitations of this study that should be noted in addition to those already discussed earlier. First, only healthy, eumenorrheic women were included in this study, which ignores postmenopausal women and oral contraceptive pill users, who have different hormonal profiles compared with eumenorrheic women. Therefore, it is possible that hypohydration may affect pain sensitivity differently in these women compared with eumenorrheic women. Second, blood samples were not obtained after water ingestion to confirm that hydration status was not altered. However, previous data indicate that consuming a moderate volume of water, similar to that in the current study, does not acutely alter hydration status in hypohydrated men (38, 61). In addition, the relatively short interval of 30 min between water ingestion and the subsequent pain test was likely insufficient for hydration status to be altered, because a previous study showed that at least 75 min is required for 300 mL of water to be completely absorbed into the bloodstream (63). Third, as participants could not be blinded to the hydration intervention, the increased pain sensitivity observed during HYPO may have been confounded by nocebo effects (64, 65). Although participants were not aware of the study hypotheses, they were aware of the aims of the study, one of which was to investigate the effects of hypohydration on pain sensitivity. Given the negative connotations of hypohydration or dehydration, it is conceivable that participants would expect hypohydration to increase pain sensitivity, which may have subsequently influenced participants actual responses to the ischemic pain test. Fourth, the body mass change values in HYPO may not accurately reflect the fluid losses induced by the 24 h of fluid restriction. Due to the scheduling constraints that included two experimental visits within 3 days per menstrual phase, we were unable to obtain a baseline body mass at the start of the hydration intervention; thus, body mass change in HYPO was calculated using EUH body mass. As the EUH and HYPO trials within each menstrual phase were separated by at least 48 h, it is likely that the values were confounded by factors other than the change in body water content (e.g., urine and fecal losses, food and fluid consumption). Acknowledging this limitation, we obtained other measures of hydration status (i.e., Sosm, USG, copeptin, and thirst ratings) in addition to body mass change for a more accurate assessment of hydrations status. Finally, our sample size may have limited our ability to detect statistically significant menstrual phase effects on pain. As such, the effects of menstrual phase on pain require further investigation. Our study could provide a reference for future studies with a similar design to base their sample size calculations on. Nevertheless, large effect sizes (?2p
 = 0.370.55) were obtained for the main effect of hypohydration on pain, with an observed power of 0.70.9, which suggests a low probability of false negatives.

Perspectives and Significance
Our data indicate that hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women and this effect may not be reversed immediately by water ingestion. Whereas, menstrual phase (EF vs. ML) does not appear to affect pain sensitivity. These findings suggest that insufficient water intake throughout the day may exacerbate pain perception in healthy women. Given the high prevalence of hypohydration among the general population (25), future studies should investigate whether hypohydration may worsen chronic pain conditions, and the potential efficacy of maintaining adequate hydration in alleviating pain symptoms. This may be especially important for older adults, who are more likely to be hypohydrated and experience chronic pain (25, 66). For human pain researchers, controlling or measuring hydration status of participants may be important to minimize confound, as clinically and physiologically relevant tests such as the cold pressor are affected (67). Although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases after controlling for hydration status, more high-quality research is required to accurately determine whether menstrual phase does or does not affect pain sensitivity. Therefore, until a consensus on the topic has been reached, our data do not discount the need for future pain researchers to verify menstrual phase.",Summarize the text for a LinkedIn post.,"In the summary, cover the following information:

Discussion
The present study employed a two-stage research investigation to examine the relationship between weight stigma and several health behaviors in a large sample of U.S. adults. As predicted, weight stigma was significantly associated with greater disordered eating, comfort eating, alcohol use, and sleep disturbance, after controlling for covariates. No such relationship was observed for physical activity.
Targeting health behaviors (e.g., eating) to achieve weight loss is common in weight-focused health promotion policies. These policies assume that individuals can improve their health by losing weight, employing weight stigma as one strategy for motivating behavior change [5]. However, our findings indicate that weight stigma is associated with poorer health behaviors, independent of BMI. Given that physical health and weight are largely shaped by factors outside of an individuals control (i.e., genetics and social determinants like socioeconomic status) [5], it is concerning that multiple behaviors, for which individuals have some control over, may be undermined by weight stigma.
Furthermore, a lower BMI may not necessarily be protective against weight stigma. In our sample, individuals across the weight spectrum, not only those with overweight or obese BMIs, reported weight stigma. In fact, moderation analyses indicated that individuals with lower BMIs showed greater disordered eating and alcohol use in the face of weight stigma. These results emerged despite individuals with higher weight reporting greater daily weight stigma. One explanation for the observed differences in health behavioral outcomes across the weight spectrum is that infrequent health behaviors may be less likely to be enacted as coping strategies. For instance, previous research has shown that alcohol use decreases as BMI increases among females with higher weight [44]. Thus, using food, instead of alcohol, may be the more common coping strategy among individuals with higher BMIs, as previous research suggests [45]. Nonetheless, the sizes of the moderation effects were very small, with some confidence intervals functionally at zero, and thus further interpretation of the present findings should only be done with caution.
Prior research has found conflicting evidence for the relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. Some studies have found that greater weight stigma is associated with short-term increases in reported exercise behavior [16, 46]. Others have shown that weight stigma is positively correlated with increased exercise avoidance, but has no direct link to self-reported exercise [14, 47]. The current study adds to the latter base of evidence showing no relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. One possible explanation is that participants were asked about their daily experiences with weight stigma, which may not correspond to their level of physical activity over the past month. Ecological momentary assessment methodology may provide better insight into this relationship, as demonstrated by Vartanian et al. who examined health motivations following stigmatizing events in daily life [48].
Despite emerging evidence that weight stigma is prevalent among men [28], there is a lack of research on mens health outcomes related to weight stigma. In this study, moderation by gender was not observed for any outcome. These results are consistent with previous research reporting no gender differences in poor health outcomes such as mortality and obesity due to weight stigma [3, 49]. Men may also feel pressured to meet societal body standards and thus may display the same magnitude of associations between weight stigma and health behaviors. It is recommended that the null gender findings are interpreted with caution, as more research is needed.
How might weight stigma influence an individuals health behaviors? One potential mechanism is stress. Previous work suggests that weight stigma is stressful [6, 50] and experimental lab studies manipulating weight stigma have shown that individuals with higher weight, as well as those who perceive themselves as overweight, show elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol following exposure to a weight-stigmatizing event [51, 52]. Additionally, some research has found that individuals who experience more weight-based discrimination have higher hair cortisol levelsa finding most pronounced in those at the highest BMI [53]. Individuals who experience greater stress may engage in more unhealthy coping behaviors. Indeed, stress can drive changes in behaviors such as eating, physical activity, and sleep [54]. For example, Tataranni et al. administered synthetic cortisol vs. placebo and found greater food consumption in the cortisol group [55]. This early work is supported by accumulating evidence that cortisol is associated with increased caloric intake and greater abdominal fat storage [56]. The health behavior pathway may not be independent from that of stress but rather reflect a serial mediation model, wherein weight stigma increases stress that in turn causes decrements in health behaviors.
The present study contributes to the weight stigma literature in several ways. As noted, a key strength of this study is the assessment of several health behaviors within a large, national census-matched sample. Previous studies that have examined weight stigma in relation to different health behaviors have often had small sample sizes or were limited to female subjects. Thus, the present study may provide more generalizable information about health behaviors in the U.S. A related strength of the study is that higher BMI scores were well-represented in the sample, with 31.4% meeting BMI criteria for obesity. This is a closer estimate of the proportion of the American population that is classified with obesity (42%) compared to previous studies [57]. Therefore, there is greater confidence that these findings reflect the experiences of individuals with obesity in the population, aiding generalizability. Lastly, we enhance reproducibility by presenting a two-stage research program of exploratory and confirmatory analyses based on recommended open science practices.
There are some limitations to consider. First, a composite weight stigma score was used due to survey constraints. While early tests indicate good construct validity, additional psychometric testing is warranted (see Online Supplementary Materials 4). Another limitation is the use of self-reported weight, which is subject to inaccuracies. Additionally, the data collection period overlapped with winter holidays. Individuals may have made new years health resolutions, and therefore the self-reported health behaviors may be more indicative of newly established goals rather than typical health habits. However, such resolutions would likely dampen, rather than magnify, the relationship between weight stigma and poor health behaviors. Lastly, the study is cross-sectional and therefore causal direction cannot be determined. Weight stigma may operate as a feedback loop that leads to weight gain through certain behaviors such as comfort eating [6], but further investigation is required. Given survey constraints, weight bias internalization was not assessed. Future research should build on these findings to determine the potential role of weight bias internalization in these health behaviors.
Despite these limitations, these studys findings show that weight stigma is significantly associated with several health behaviors. If future research confirms that this is indeed a causal relationship, weight stigma could cumulatively undermine physical health over time. Taken together, these findings highlight weight stigma as a potential barrier to healthy behaviors, and suggest that one strategy to improve population health may be to reduce weight stigma. Though more research is needed, it may be important to employ more weight-inclusive approaches to health promotion, such as removing stigmatizing language or weight outcomes from health policies and program objectives [5].",Summarize the text for a LinkedIn post.,"In the summary, cover the following information:
