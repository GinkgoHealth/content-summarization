{"text1_prompt00": {"text": "Comparisons in the Recovery Response From Resistance Exercise Between Young and Middle-Aged Men\n\nIntroduction\nDecreases in muscle mass, function, and neuromuscular activation are significant factors contributing to the decline in the quality of life during the\u00a0aging\u00a0process (21,26). However, the majority of research investigating the effect of\u00a0aging\u00a0has primarily focused on comparing adults older than 60 years with younger adult populations in their second, third, or fourth decade of life (7,16\u009618,25). It seems that only a single study is known that has compared young and middle-aged (40\u009659 years) adults on strength performance and recovery (28). Understanding changes in muscle function as adults move from young to middle-age may provide for a better understanding of how to minimize the significant declines in muscle function as one reaches retirement age.\nChanges in recovery from a bout of exercise may be associated with the\u00a0aging\u00a0process (12). Recovery is often determined by the return of performance measures to baseline (BL) levels or by an attenuation of the inflammatory or\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0response to exercise (15,35). Previous research has reported a decrease in the magnitude of the immune response in older adults (e.g., >65 years) compared with younger adults after maximal graded exercise tests on a treadmill (8) and on an electrically braked cycle ergometer (27). Such a decline may be indicative of a delay in recovery because the inflammatory response is thought to play a major role in muscle remodeling and recovery (37). Decreases in muscle mass and strength associated with\u00a0aging\u00a0have been suggested to impair the recovery process after exercise, by increasing the time to adaptation or muscle repair (7,33). Previously, recovery from resistance exercise has been reported to be impaired in recreationally trained (3\u00966 hours of exercise per week) older adults (?69 years) compared with younger adults (38). Similarly, McLester et al. (28) reported a delay in recovery (e.g., in repetitions performed up to 96 hours after exercise) from a total body resistance exercise program in middle-aged men (56 \u00b1 5 years) compared with younger men (23 \u00b1 5 years). By contrast, other investigations have reported no difference in recovery between younger and older populations when assessing recovery through electrically stimulated muscle contraction (1,23). The differences between these studies are likely related to differences in the mode of exercise, training intensity, and pretraining status (1,23,28,38). Furthermore, only one of these investigations included men with\u00a0resistance training\u00a0experience (28). Considering the differences noted between younger and older adults, examining changes in recovery as one moves from young to older age may provide a better understanding regarding reducing age-associated performance decreases. Therefore, the primary purpose of this investigation was to compare the recovery response between young (18\u009630 years) and middle-aged men (40\u009659 years) from an acute high-volume isokinetic resistance exercise workout. A secondary purpose was to compare the effects of this workout on markers of\u00a0inflammation\u00a0and\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0during the 48-hour recovery period.\nMethods\nExperimental Approach to the Problem\nA parallel study design was used to determine the effects of a single bout of high-volume isokinetic resistance exercise on changes in muscle strength, as well as markers of\u00a0muscle damage, and the inflammatory response between young (18\u009630 years) and middle-aged adults (40\u009659 years). Before data collection, all participants reported to the Human Performance Laboratory (HPL) for anthropometric assessment and familiarization with training and assessment protocols. Participants then returned to the HPL to perform a high-volume resistance exercise protocol. Testing was performed before and immediately after the\u00a0resistance training\u00a0protocol. Recovery assessments (both performance,\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0and inflammatory) were also assessed at 24 and 48 hours after exercise.\nSubjects\nNineteen recreationally trained men volunteered to participate in this investigation. Study participants were recruited and placed into 2 groups based on age. The young adult (YA) group consisted of men between the ages of 18\u009630 years, whereas the middle-aged (MA) group consisted of men between the ages of 40\u009659 years. None of the participants were competitive athletes, and all were recreationally resistance-trained at study enrollment. Inclusion criteria required participants to meet the age requirements of one of the groups and be recreationally active, including\u00a0resistance training\u00a0for the previous 6 months before enrollment as defined by the American College of Sports Medicine (150 minutes of exercise per week) (14). All participants were free of any physical limitations that may have affected performance and were not using any medications, dietary supplements, or any other performance-enhancing drugs before or during the study as determined by a health and activity questionnaire. After an explanation of all procedures, risks, and benefits, each participant gave his written informed consent before participation in this study. The Institutional Review Board of the University of Central Florida approved the research protocol. Experimental group characteristics are presented in\u00a0Table 1.\nProcedures\nBoth groups reported to the HPL on 4 separate occasions. On the first visit (D1), participants reported to the HPL after a 2-hour fast. Anthropometric assessments were performed and included height, body mass, and body composition. After anthropometric assessments, participants performed a standardized warm-up consisting of 5 minutes of pedaling on a cycle ergometer at 50 watts. After the warm-up, participants completed a familiarization protocol on the isokinetic device (S4; Biodex Medical System, Inc., New York, NY, USA). On the second visit (D2), participants arrived after a 10-hour fast and recorded their subjective levels of pain and soreness on a visual analog scale (VAS). There were at least 48 hours between the first and second visits, with no more than 7 days between these 2 visits. After the VAS, participants then provided a BL blood sample followed by an ultrasound (US) assessment of the vastus lateralis (VL) of their right leg. Participants then performed the first lower-body performance assessment protocol (BL). After a 5-minute rest period, participants completed the high-volume isokinetic resistance exercise protocol (HVP), followed immediately post (IP) by another lower-body performance assessment protocol. Blood samples were obtained at IP, 30 (30P), 60 (60P), and 120 minutes (120P) after the exercise protocol. Ultrasound assessments were obtained at IP and 120P, whereas an additional VAS assessment was completed at 30P. Participants reported to the HPL 24 (24 H) and 48 hours (48 H) after D2 for lower-body assessments. In addition, blood draws, US, and VAS measures were also obtained. The order of lower-body assessment, VAS, blood draw, and US measures were the same for all testing sessions.\u00a0Figure 1\u00a0displays the study procedures and timeline.\nDietary Recall\nAll participants provided a 3-day dietary recall beginning the day before D2 testing until the morning of 48 H testing. Participants were asked to maintain their regular diet for the duration of the investigation. FoodWorks nutrient analysis software (McGraw-Hill, New York, NY, USA) was used to analyze the self-reported dietary recalls for total kilocalorie intake and macronutrient distributions (carbohydrate, protein, and fat).\nAnthropometric Assessment\nBody mass (\u00b10.1 kg) and height (\u00b10.1 cm) were measured using a Health-o-meter Professional scale (Patient Weighing Scale, Model 500 KL; Pelstar, Alsip, IL, USA). Body composition was assessed using a multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analyzer (InBody 770; Cerritos, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's guidelines.\nVisual Analog Scale\nParticipants were instructed to assess their subjective feelings of pain and soreness using a 100-mm VAS (23). Participants were asked to rate pain and soreness intensity by placing a mark on a horizontal 100-mm VAS (5,29). Verbal anchors were used at each end of the scale representing no pain or soreness and the worst possible soreness or pain. The VAS was performed at BL, IP, 30P, 24 H, and 48 H.\nUltrasound Assessments\nAll US assessments were performed on the VL of the right leg as previously described (39). Participants were asked to lay supine on an examination table with both legs fully extended for a minimum of 5 minutes to allow fluid shifts to occur (2). Before image collection, all anatomical locations of interest were identified using standardized landmarks for the VL muscle. The length of the VL encompassed the distance from the lateral condyle of the tibia to the most prominent point of the greater trochanter of the femur. The VL measurement required the participant to lay on their side, whereas cross-sectional area (CSA) and muscle thickness (MT) measurements were obtained from the US. The sampling location was determined by the point of intersection between the VL and 50% of the straight-line distance between the greater trochanter and the lateral epicondyle of the femur (39). After determining the desired anatomical position, a linear probe coated with transmission gel was positioned on the surface of the skin to collect the US image. For all US measurements, a 12 MHz probe (LOGIQ P5; General Electric, Wauwatosa, WI, USA) coated with water-soluble transmission gel (Aquasonic 100; Parker Laboratories, Inc., Fairfield, NJ, USA) was passed over the surface of the thigh at the predetermined anatomical locations outlined above. The depth was set at 6.0 cm, gain at 50 dB, and dynamic range at 72. Further analysis of US images was performed offline using image analysis software (ImageJ, version 1.45 s) available from the National Institutes of Health (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). All US images were obtained and analyzed by the same technician. Test-related reliability for all US measurements was determined by using 10 different subjects (not participants from this study) examined 24\u009648 hours apart. Intraclass correlation coefficients and minimal differences (MD) were determined for CSA (R\u00a0= 0.99; MD = 0.85 cm2) and MT (R\u00a0= 0.97; MD = 0.09 cm).\nIsokinetic Assessment Protocol\nThe isokinetic assessment protocol was performed at BL, IP, 120P, 24 H, and 48 H to quantify performance decrements and recovery as a result of the HVP. Participants were seated in the isokinetic dynamometer (S4; Biodex Medical System, Inc.), positioned with a hip angle of 110\u00b0 and strapped into the chair at the waist, shoulders, and across the thigh. Chair and dynamometer settings were adjusted for each participant to correctly align the axis of rotation with the lateral condyle of the femur. All participants were tested on their right leg, which was secured to the dynamometer arm just above the medial and lateral malleoli. The lever arm of the dynamometer was programmed to extend the participant's leg to 155\u00b0 of knee flexion (where 180\u00b0 is a full extension) and flex the participant's leg to 85 degrees of flexion. Isokinetic dynamometer settings for each individual were recorded and remained consistent throughout the study. The isokinetic assessment protocol at each time point consisted of 2 maximal voluntary isometric contractions performed at a 70\u00b0 angle, 1 set of 3 repetitions of concentric knee extension at 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0with passive knee flexion to starting position, and 1 set of 3 repetitions of concentric knee extension at 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0with a passive knee flexion to starting position. Of the 3 maximal repetitions, the highest peak torque (PKT) and average torque (AVGT) were recorded for each speed.\nHigh-Volume Isokinetic Resistance Exercise Protocol\nAfter the isokinetic assessment protocol at BL on D2, the participant remained seated, and the HVP was performed. The HVP consisted of 8 sets of 10 repetitions of concentric knee extension and eccentric knee flexion at 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1. A 1-minute rest interval was provided between each set. Participants were encouraged to provide maximal effort throughout the HVP. Work performed in each set of the HVP was calculated as the product of the mean power of each kick over the time to complete the kick. Total work done was calculated as the sum of the work performed in each of the 8 sets of 10 repetitions during the HVP.\nBlood Collection\nBlood samples were obtained at 7 time points throughout the study (BL, IP, 30P, 60P, 120P, 24 H, and 48 H). The BL, IP, 30P, 60P, and 120P blood samples were obtained using a Teflon cannula placed in a superficial forearm vein using a 3-way stopcock with a male luer lock adapter and a plastic syringe after arrival to the HPL on D2. The cannula was maintained patent using a nonheparinized isotonic saline solution (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). All blood samples were obtained after a 15-minute equilibration period with the exception of the IP blood draw. During the remaining time points (24 H and 48 H), blood was obtained by a single-use disposable needle with the participant lying in a supine position for at least 15 minutes before sampling. Blood draws during 24 H and 48 H were obtained after a 10-hour fast. A total of 20 ml of whole blood was collected at each time point in serum and K2EDTA-treated Vacutainer tubes, (Becton Dickinson). Blood in the K2EDTA tubes was immediately centrifuged at 4,000g\u00a0for 15 minutes, then placed into 1.8-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and frozen at ?80\u00b0 C for later analysis. Blood in the serum tubes was allowed to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes and then subsequently centrifuged, aliquoted, and stored through the same procedure.\nBiochemical Analyses\nSerum concentrations of creatine kinase (CK) were analyzed with the use of a commercially available kinetic assay kit (Sekisui Diagnostics, Charlottetown, PE, Canada) as per manufacturer's instructions. C-reactive protein (CRP) and myoglobin (Mb) concentrations were obtained through commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (CRP; R&D Systems; Minneapolis, MN, USA) (Mb: Calbiotech, Spring Valley, CA, USA), whereas interleukin-6 (IL-6) was obtained through high-sensitivity multiplex assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). To eliminate interassay variability, all samples for a particular assay were thawed once and analyzed by the same technician using a BioTek Eon spectrophotometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT). All samples were analyzed in duplicate with a mean coefficient of variation of 4.50% for CK, 7.38% for CRP, 3.55% for IL-6, and 5.03% for Mb. All biochemical assays were run as per the manufacturer's instructions.\nStatistical Analyses\nPerformance measures were analyzed through repeated measures analysis of covariance to control for BL differences between the groups. Changes in subjective levels of pain and soreness, as well as markers of\u00a0inflammation\u00a0and\u00a0muscle damage, were analyzed through repeated measures analysis of variance. In the event of a significant\u00a0F\u00a0value, least significant difference post hoc tests were used for pairwise comparison. Baseline performance comparisons of both groups were determined by independent t-tests. Outliers were identified when values exceeded 1.5 times the interquartile range (3). For all analyses, a criterion alpha level of ? ? 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Data were analyzed using SPSS v23 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All data are reported as a mean \u00b1\u00a0SD.\nResults\nPerformance Measures\nIsometric Assessments\nUnadjusted isometric performance measures are depicted in\u00a0Table 2. One participant from YA was identified as an outlier and removed from all study analyses. Baseline comparisons between YA and MA revealed that YA had significantly greater AVGT (p\u00a0= 0.043), rate of torque development at 200 ms (RTD200) (p\u00a0= 0.033), and a trend toward a greater isometric PKT (p\u00a0= 0.057) during the isometric assessment than MA. After controlling for BL, examination of the recovery response from the HVP revealed no significant group \u00d7 time interactions for PKT (F\u00a0= 1.009;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.377), AVGT (F\u00a0= 0.997;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.402), or for RTD200 (F\u00a0= 0.225;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.879). There were also no significant main effects of time for PKT (F\u00a0= 0.281;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.759), AVGT (F\u00a0= 0.289;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.833), or RTD200 (F\u00a0= 0.073;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.974).\nIsokinetic Assessment\nUnadjusted isokinetic performance measures are depicted in\u00a0Table 2. No significant differences at BL were noted between the groups; however, a trend toward a greater PKT at both 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.081;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.061) and 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 1.562;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.083) was observed for YA compared with MA. After controlling for BL, no significant group \u00d7 time interactions were observed for PKT at either 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.681;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.503) or 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.450;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.656). In addition, there were no significant main effects for time observed for PKT at either 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.272;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.746) or 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.109;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.910) for both groups combined.\nNo significant difference at BL was found for AVGT at 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.940;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.148), but a trend toward a greater AVGT was noted in YA at 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.008;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.094). When controlling for BL, no significant group \u00d7 time interactions were observed for AVGT at 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.897;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.404) or 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.769;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.484). In addition, no significant main effects for time were noted for AVGT at either 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.228;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.762) or 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.155;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.878).\nBlood Analyses\nChanges in CK and Mb can be found in\u00a0Figures 2\u00a0and\u00a03, respectively, whereas changes in CRP and IL-6 can be observed in\u00a0Figures 4\u00a0and\u00a05, respectively. No significant group \u00d7 time interactions were observed for Mb (F\u00a0= 0.307;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.640), CK (F\u00a0= 0.607;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.551), CRP (F\u00a0= 0.320;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.602), or IL-6 (F\u00a0= 0.466;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.589). However, significant main effects for time were observed for both Mb (F\u00a0= 8.708;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.005) and CK (F\u00a0= 8.127;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.001). Myoglobin was significantly higher at 30P (p\u00a0= 0.002), 60P (p\u00a0= 0.001), and 120P (p\u00a0= 0.007) compared with BL, whereas CK concentrations at 24 H (p\u00a0= 0.002) and 48 H (p\u00a0= 0.006) were significantly higher than BL. Although no significant main effect for time was observed for CRP (F\u00a0= 3.042;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.097), a significant main effect was noted for IL-6 (F\u00a0= 3.689;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.05). Changes in IL-6 were significantly elevated from BL at 30P (p\u00a0= 0.032), 120P (p\u00a0= 0.002), 24 H (p\u00a0= 0.007), and 48 H (p\u00a0= 0.034) for both groups combined.\nVisual Analog Scales\nChanges in subjective feelings of pain and soreness can be observed in\u00a0Table 3. No significant group \u00d7 time interactions were observed for subjective measures of pain (F\u00a0= 0.102;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.959) or soreness (F\u00a0= 0.886;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.455). No significant main effect for time was observed for subjective levels of pain (F\u00a0= 1.085;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.351); however, a significant main effect for time was observed for subjective levels of muscle soreness (F\u00a0= 7.319;\u00a0p\u00a0= < 0.001) in both groups combined. Muscle soreness was significantly higher at 30P (p\u00a0= 0.001), 24 H (p\u00a0= 0.001), and 48 H (p\u00a0= 0.002) compared with BL.\nUltrasound Assessment\nChanges in muscle CSA and MT can be observed in\u00a0Table 3. No significant group \u00d7 time interactions were observed for muscle CSA (F\u00a0= 0.246;\u00a0p\u00a00.747) or MT (F\u00a0= 0.687;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.530). However, a significant main effect for time was observed for both CSA (F\u00a0= 13.460;\u00a0p\u00a0< 0.001) and MT (F\u00a0= 3.685;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.028). Muscle CSA and MT were significantly greater at IP (p\u00a0< 0.001) compared with BL.\nDiscussion\nResults of this study indicated no differences in the recovery response between YA and MA for any of the performance measures, nor in subjective levels of muscle pain or soreness. Furthermore, no between-group differences were observed in the inflammatory or\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0response to the exercise protocol. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine differences in the recovery response from high-volume resistance exercise between recreationally trained young and middle-aged adults. Our results comparing BL performance measures seem to be in agreement with other investigations, demonstrating differences in strength measures between young (23\u009629 years) and older adults (60\u009665 years) (7,15,24), and between middle-aged (41\u009642 years) and older adults (70\u009672 years) (17,18). It does seem that the decline in strength may develop during middle age. However, recovery from exercise seems to be comparable in both younger and middle-aged adults as reflected by similar changes in performance and markers of\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0and\u00a0inflammation. Although changes in strength may occur in middle age, recovery from exercise does seem to be maintained in recreationally trained individuals.\nThe differences observed at BL in isometric force and the rate of force development is consistent with other investigations comparing younger and older adults (16,19,36). Although differences in age between young and middle-aged adults do seem to affect BL levels of strength, it does not seem to affect recovery from exercise. This is supported by similar patterns of\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0and\u00a0inflammation\u00a0observed during the recovery period after the HVP. Elevations in Mb and CK concentrations are consistent with the expected physiological response from a bout of resistance exercise (9,34). These results also suggest that middle-aged recreationally active men who regularly engage in\u00a0resistance training\u00a0do not seem to be at increased risk for greater soreness or\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0in comparison with younger recreationally trained men.\nSimilar response patterns were also noted in the inflammatory response for both groups. No significant elevations from BL were observed in CRP. However, significant increases in IL-6 concentrations were observed for both groups. Although CRP is an acute phase protein whose function is to activate the innate immune response and enhance phagocytosis (10), it does not seem to change after an acute bout of resistance exercise (6). Previous research has reported no significant changes in CRP concentrations after\u00a0resistance training\u00a0protocols recruiting primarily both upper-body (31) and lower-body exercises (4) in younger men. Furthermore, previous investigations have also indicated that training experience can reduce the CRP response to an acute bout of exercise (22,35). Considering that participants in both YA and MA were recreationally trained, it is likely that this training experience may have attenuated the CRP response. Physiologically, it is consistent with the lower stress and damage that occurs with repetitive training (9,35). Interleukin-6 is an inflammatory cytokine that facilitates communication for the mobilization, proliferation, and differentiation of immune cells to the site of tissue damage (6) and has been shown to increase after exercise (11). Elevations in IL-6 are related to the intensity, duration, and mode of training (11,13,32), but the literature is inconclusive regarding the IL-6 response to\u00a0resistance training. A recent study reported that a bout of high-volume resistance exercise (8 sets of 10 repetitions with 70% of maximal strength in the squat exercise) resulted in a significant elevation in IL-6 concentrations 30 min after exercise, but no changes were observed after a bout of high-intensity resistance exercise (8 sets of 3 repetitions with 90% of maximal strength in the squat exercise) in experienced, trained lifters (4). The IL-6 response observed during this investigation as a result of a bout of high-volume resistance exercise seems to be consistent with that recently reported by Bartolomei et al. (4). However, age did not seem to exacerbate nor attenuate the IL-6 response in recreationally trained participants.\nNo differences were noted in the inflammatory or\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0response between YA and MA. As discussed earlier, this is likely related to the recreational training background of the participants. However, there were several limitations to the study that need to be acknowledged. The exercise protocol was performed on an isokinetic dynamometer, which may not have as much practical application as most\u00a0resistance training\u00a0programs use dynamic constant resistance exercises. In addition, unilateral, single-joint exercise recruited a relatively smaller muscle mass than is commonly used in most training programs. The use of this modality of exercise, which has been demonstrated to be very effective in eliciting\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0(20,30), may not have been sufficient to elicit significant performance and inflammatory changes in these recreationally trained participants. Future research should examine modes of training specific to the typical training program of the participants.\nPractical Applications\nThe results of this study indicate that changes in muscle performance seem to begin during middle age, even in recreationally trained individuals. However, participating in recreational\u00a0resistance training\u00a0may mitigate any alteration in the recovery response from exercise. These results should be examined in the context that recovery was investigated after a unilateral, single-joint isokinetic exercise protocol. Although this method has been previously used as an effective mode of exercise to elicit\u00a0muscle damage, it is not specific to the type of exercises typically used by recreational lifters. Future studies may wish to compare these population groups using multijoint, dynamic constant resistance exercises common to the training programs of most recreational lifters, regardless of age.\n", "folder": "text/2023-06-20 full", "system_role": "You are a helpful assistant.", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 1000, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613", "qna": {"date": "2023-06-20 1431", "folder": "text/2023-06-20 full", "article_title": "Comparisons in the Recovery Response From Resistance Exercise Between Young and Middle-Aged Men", "system_role": "You are a helpful assistant.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613", "text": "Comparisons in the Recovery Response From Resistance Exercise Between Young and Middle-Aged Men\n\nIntroduction\nDecreases in muscle mass, function, and neuromuscular activation are significant factors contributing to the decline in the quality of life during the\u00a0aging\u00a0process (21,26). However, the majority of research investigating the effect of\u00a0aging\u00a0has primarily focused on comparing adults older than 60 years with younger adult populations in their second, third, or fourth decade of life (7,16\u009618,25). It seems that only a single study is known that has compared young and middle-aged (40\u009659 years) adults on strength performance and recovery (28). Understanding changes in muscle function as adults move from young to middle-age may provide for a better understanding of how to minimize the significant declines in muscle function as one reaches retirement age.\nChanges in recovery from a bout of exercise may be associated with the\u00a0aging\u00a0process (12). Recovery is often determined by the return of performance measures to baseline (BL) levels or by an attenuation of the inflammatory or\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0response to exercise (15,35). Previous research has reported a decrease in the magnitude of the immune response in older adults (e.g., >65 years) compared with younger adults after maximal graded exercise tests on a treadmill (8) and on an electrically braked cycle ergometer (27). Such a decline may be indicative of a delay in recovery because the inflammatory response is thought to play a major role in muscle remodeling and recovery (37). Decreases in muscle mass and strength associated with\u00a0aging\u00a0have been suggested to impair the recovery process after exercise, by increasing the time to adaptation or muscle repair (7,33). Previously, recovery from resistance exercise has been reported to be impaired in recreationally trained (3\u00966 hours of exercise per week) older adults (?69 years) compared with younger adults (38). Similarly, McLester et al. (28) reported a delay in recovery (e.g., in repetitions performed up to 96 hours after exercise) from a total body resistance exercise program in middle-aged men (56 \u00b1 5 years) compared with younger men (23 \u00b1 5 years). By contrast, other investigations have reported no difference in recovery between younger and older populations when assessing recovery through electrically stimulated muscle contraction (1,23). The differences between these studies are likely related to differences in the mode of exercise, training intensity, and pretraining status (1,23,28,38). Furthermore, only one of these investigations included men with\u00a0resistance training\u00a0experience (28). Considering the differences noted between younger and older adults, examining changes in recovery as one moves from young to older age may provide a better understanding regarding reducing age-associated performance decreases. Therefore, the primary purpose of this investigation was to compare the recovery response between young (18\u009630 years) and middle-aged men (40\u009659 years) from an acute high-volume isokinetic resistance exercise workout. A secondary purpose was to compare the effects of this workout on markers of\u00a0inflammation\u00a0and\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0during the 48-hour recovery period.\nMethods\nExperimental Approach to the Problem\nA parallel study design was used to determine the effects of a single bout of high-volume isokinetic resistance exercise on changes in muscle strength, as well as markers of\u00a0muscle damage, and the inflammatory response between young (18\u009630 years) and middle-aged adults (40\u009659 years). Before data collection, all participants reported to the Human Performance Laboratory (HPL) for anthropometric assessment and familiarization with training and assessment protocols. Participants then returned to the HPL to perform a high-volume resistance exercise protocol. Testing was performed before and immediately after the\u00a0resistance training\u00a0protocol. Recovery assessments (both performance,\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0and inflammatory) were also assessed at 24 and 48 hours after exercise.\nSubjects\nNineteen recreationally trained men volunteered to participate in this investigation. Study participants were recruited and placed into 2 groups based on age. The young adult (YA) group consisted of men between the ages of 18\u009630 years, whereas the middle-aged (MA) group consisted of men between the ages of 40\u009659 years. None of the participants were competitive athletes, and all were recreationally resistance-trained at study enrollment. Inclusion criteria required participants to meet the age requirements of one of the groups and be recreationally active, including\u00a0resistance training\u00a0for the previous 6 months before enrollment as defined by the American College of Sports Medicine (150 minutes of exercise per week) (14). All participants were free of any physical limitations that may have affected performance and were not using any medications, dietary supplements, or any other performance-enhancing drugs before or during the study as determined by a health and activity questionnaire. After an explanation of all procedures, risks, and benefits, each participant gave his written informed consent before participation in this study. The Institutional Review Board of the University of Central Florida approved the research protocol. Experimental group characteristics are presented in\u00a0Table 1.\nProcedures\nBoth groups reported to the HPL on 4 separate occasions. On the first visit (D1), participants reported to the HPL after a 2-hour fast. Anthropometric assessments were performed and included height, body mass, and body composition. After anthropometric assessments, participants performed a standardized warm-up consisting of 5 minutes of pedaling on a cycle ergometer at 50 watts. After the warm-up, participants completed a familiarization protocol on the isokinetic device (S4; Biodex Medical System, Inc., New York, NY, USA). On the second visit (D2), participants arrived after a 10-hour fast and recorded their subjective levels of pain and soreness on a visual analog scale (VAS). There were at least 48 hours between the first and second visits, with no more than 7 days between these 2 visits. After the VAS, participants then provided a BL blood sample followed by an ultrasound (US) assessment of the vastus lateralis (VL) of their right leg. Participants then performed the first lower-body performance assessment protocol (BL). After a 5-minute rest period, participants completed the high-volume isokinetic resistance exercise protocol (HVP), followed immediately post (IP) by another lower-body performance assessment protocol. Blood samples were obtained at IP, 30 (30P), 60 (60P), and 120 minutes (120P) after the exercise protocol. Ultrasound assessments were obtained at IP and 120P, whereas an additional VAS assessment was completed at 30P. Participants reported to the HPL 24 (24 H) and 48 hours (48 H) after D2 for lower-body assessments. In addition, blood draws, US, and VAS measures were also obtained. The order of lower-body assessment, VAS, blood draw, and US measures were the same for all testing sessions.\u00a0Figure 1\u00a0displays the study procedures and timeline.\nDietary Recall\nAll participants provided a 3-day dietary recall beginning the day before D2 testing until the morning of 48 H testing. Participants were asked to maintain their regular diet for the duration of the investigation. FoodWorks nutrient analysis software (McGraw-Hill, New York, NY, USA) was used to analyze the self-reported dietary recalls for total kilocalorie intake and macronutrient distributions (carbohydrate, protein, and fat).\nAnthropometric Assessment\nBody mass (\u00b10.1 kg) and height (\u00b10.1 cm) were measured using a Health-o-meter Professional scale (Patient Weighing Scale, Model 500 KL; Pelstar, Alsip, IL, USA). Body composition was assessed using a multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analyzer (InBody 770; Cerritos, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's guidelines.\nVisual Analog Scale\nParticipants were instructed to assess their subjective feelings of pain and soreness using a 100-mm VAS (23). Participants were asked to rate pain and soreness intensity by placing a mark on a horizontal 100-mm VAS (5,29). Verbal anchors were used at each end of the scale representing no pain or soreness and the worst possible soreness or pain. The VAS was performed at BL, IP, 30P, 24 H, and 48 H.\nUltrasound Assessments\nAll US assessments were performed on the VL of the right leg as previously described (39). Participants were asked to lay supine on an examination table with both legs fully extended for a minimum of 5 minutes to allow fluid shifts to occur (2). Before image collection, all anatomical locations of interest were identified using standardized landmarks for the VL muscle. The length of the VL encompassed the distance from the lateral condyle of the tibia to the most prominent point of the greater trochanter of the femur. The VL measurement required the participant to lay on their side, whereas cross-sectional area (CSA) and muscle thickness (MT) measurements were obtained from the US. The sampling location was determined by the point of intersection between the VL and 50% of the straight-line distance between the greater trochanter and the lateral epicondyle of the femur (39). After determining the desired anatomical position, a linear probe coated with transmission gel was positioned on the surface of the skin to collect the US image. For all US measurements, a 12 MHz probe (LOGIQ P5; General Electric, Wauwatosa, WI, USA) coated with water-soluble transmission gel (Aquasonic 100; Parker Laboratories, Inc., Fairfield, NJ, USA) was passed over the surface of the thigh at the predetermined anatomical locations outlined above. The depth was set at 6.0 cm, gain at 50 dB, and dynamic range at 72. Further analysis of US images was performed offline using image analysis software (ImageJ, version 1.45 s) available from the National Institutes of Health (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). All US images were obtained and analyzed by the same technician. Test-related reliability for all US measurements was determined by using 10 different subjects (not participants from this study) examined 24\u009648 hours apart. Intraclass correlation coefficients and minimal differences (MD) were determined for CSA (R\u00a0= 0.99; MD = 0.85 cm2) and MT (R\u00a0= 0.97; MD = 0.09 cm).\nIsokinetic Assessment Protocol\nThe isokinetic assessment protocol was performed at BL, IP, 120P, 24 H, and 48 H to quantify performance decrements and recovery as a result of the HVP. Participants were seated in the isokinetic dynamometer (S4; Biodex Medical System, Inc.), positioned with a hip angle of 110\u00b0 and strapped into the chair at the waist, shoulders, and across the thigh. Chair and dynamometer settings were adjusted for each participant to correctly align the axis of rotation with the lateral condyle of the femur. All participants were tested on their right leg, which was secured to the dynamometer arm just above the medial and lateral malleoli. The lever arm of the dynamometer was programmed to extend the participant's leg to 155\u00b0 of knee flexion (where 180\u00b0 is a full extension) and flex the participant's leg to 85 degrees of flexion. Isokinetic dynamometer settings for each individual were recorded and remained consistent throughout the study. The isokinetic assessment protocol at each time point consisted of 2 maximal voluntary isometric contractions performed at a 70\u00b0 angle, 1 set of 3 repetitions of concentric knee extension at 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0with passive knee flexion to starting position, and 1 set of 3 repetitions of concentric knee extension at 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0with a passive knee flexion to starting position. Of the 3 maximal repetitions, the highest peak torque (PKT) and average torque (AVGT) were recorded for each speed.\nHigh-Volume Isokinetic Resistance Exercise Protocol\nAfter the isokinetic assessment protocol at BL on D2, the participant remained seated, and the HVP was performed. The HVP consisted of 8 sets of 10 repetitions of concentric knee extension and eccentric knee flexion at 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1. A 1-minute rest interval was provided between each set. Participants were encouraged to provide maximal effort throughout the HVP. Work performed in each set of the HVP was calculated as the product of the mean power of each kick over the time to complete the kick. Total work done was calculated as the sum of the work performed in each of the 8 sets of 10 repetitions during the HVP.\nBlood Collection\nBlood samples were obtained at 7 time points throughout the study (BL, IP, 30P, 60P, 120P, 24 H, and 48 H). The BL, IP, 30P, 60P, and 120P blood samples were obtained using a Teflon cannula placed in a superficial forearm vein using a 3-way stopcock with a male luer lock adapter and a plastic syringe after arrival to the HPL on D2. The cannula was maintained patent using a nonheparinized isotonic saline solution (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). All blood samples were obtained after a 15-minute equilibration period with the exception of the IP blood draw. During the remaining time points (24 H and 48 H), blood was obtained by a single-use disposable needle with the participant lying in a supine position for at least 15 minutes before sampling. Blood draws during 24 H and 48 H were obtained after a 10-hour fast. A total of 20 ml of whole blood was collected at each time point in serum and K2EDTA-treated Vacutainer tubes, (Becton Dickinson). Blood in the K2EDTA tubes was immediately centrifuged at 4,000g\u00a0for 15 minutes, then placed into 1.8-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and frozen at ?80\u00b0 C for later analysis. Blood in the serum tubes was allowed to clot at room temperature for 30 minutes and then subsequently centrifuged, aliquoted, and stored through the same procedure.\nBiochemical Analyses\nSerum concentrations of creatine kinase (CK) were analyzed with the use of a commercially available kinetic assay kit (Sekisui Diagnostics, Charlottetown, PE, Canada) as per manufacturer's instructions. C-reactive protein (CRP) and myoglobin (Mb) concentrations were obtained through commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (CRP; R&D Systems; Minneapolis, MN, USA) (Mb: Calbiotech, Spring Valley, CA, USA), whereas interleukin-6 (IL-6) was obtained through high-sensitivity multiplex assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). To eliminate interassay variability, all samples for a particular assay were thawed once and analyzed by the same technician using a BioTek Eon spectrophotometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT). All samples were analyzed in duplicate with a mean coefficient of variation of 4.50% for CK, 7.38% for CRP, 3.55% for IL-6, and 5.03% for Mb. All biochemical assays were run as per the manufacturer's instructions.\nStatistical Analyses\nPerformance measures were analyzed through repeated measures analysis of covariance to control for BL differences between the groups. Changes in subjective levels of pain and soreness, as well as markers of\u00a0inflammation\u00a0and\u00a0muscle damage, were analyzed through repeated measures analysis of variance. In the event of a significant\u00a0F\u00a0value, least significant difference post hoc tests were used for pairwise comparison. Baseline performance comparisons of both groups were determined by independent t-tests. Outliers were identified when values exceeded 1.5 times the interquartile range (3). For all analyses, a criterion alpha level of ? ? 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Data were analyzed using SPSS v23 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All data are reported as a mean \u00b1\u00a0SD.\nResults\nPerformance Measures\nIsometric Assessments\nUnadjusted isometric performance measures are depicted in\u00a0Table 2. One participant from YA was identified as an outlier and removed from all study analyses. Baseline comparisons between YA and MA revealed that YA had significantly greater AVGT (p\u00a0= 0.043), rate of torque development at 200 ms (RTD200) (p\u00a0= 0.033), and a trend toward a greater isometric PKT (p\u00a0= 0.057) during the isometric assessment than MA. After controlling for BL, examination of the recovery response from the HVP revealed no significant group \u00d7 time interactions for PKT (F\u00a0= 1.009;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.377), AVGT (F\u00a0= 0.997;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.402), or for RTD200 (F\u00a0= 0.225;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.879). There were also no significant main effects of time for PKT (F\u00a0= 0.281;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.759), AVGT (F\u00a0= 0.289;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.833), or RTD200 (F\u00a0= 0.073;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.974).\nIsokinetic Assessment\nUnadjusted isokinetic performance measures are depicted in\u00a0Table 2. No significant differences at BL were noted between the groups; however, a trend toward a greater PKT at both 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.081;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.061) and 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 1.562;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.083) was observed for YA compared with MA. After controlling for BL, no significant group \u00d7 time interactions were observed for PKT at either 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.681;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.503) or 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.450;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.656). In addition, there were no significant main effects for time observed for PKT at either 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.272;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.746) or 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.109;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.910) for both groups combined.\nNo significant difference at BL was found for AVGT at 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.940;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.148), but a trend toward a greater AVGT was noted in YA at 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.008;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.094). When controlling for BL, no significant group \u00d7 time interactions were observed for AVGT at 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.897;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.404) or 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.769;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.484). In addition, no significant main effects for time were noted for AVGT at either 240\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.228;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.762) or 60\u00b0\u00b7s?1\u00a0(F\u00a0= 0.155;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.878).\nBlood Analyses\nChanges in CK and Mb can be found in\u00a0Figures 2\u00a0and\u00a03, respectively, whereas changes in CRP and IL-6 can be observed in\u00a0Figures 4\u00a0and\u00a05, respectively. No significant group \u00d7 time interactions were observed for Mb (F\u00a0= 0.307;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.640), CK (F\u00a0= 0.607;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.551), CRP (F\u00a0= 0.320;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.602), or IL-6 (F\u00a0= 0.466;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.589). However, significant main effects for time were observed for both Mb (F\u00a0= 8.708;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.005) and CK (F\u00a0= 8.127;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.001). Myoglobin was significantly higher at 30P (p\u00a0= 0.002), 60P (p\u00a0= 0.001), and 120P (p\u00a0= 0.007) compared with BL, whereas CK concentrations at 24 H (p\u00a0= 0.002) and 48 H (p\u00a0= 0.006) were significantly higher than BL. Although no significant main effect for time was observed for CRP (F\u00a0= 3.042;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.097), a significant main effect was noted for IL-6 (F\u00a0= 3.689;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.05). Changes in IL-6 were significantly elevated from BL at 30P (p\u00a0= 0.032), 120P (p\u00a0= 0.002), 24 H (p\u00a0= 0.007), and 48 H (p\u00a0= 0.034) for both groups combined.\nVisual Analog Scales\nChanges in subjective feelings of pain and soreness can be observed in\u00a0Table 3. No significant group \u00d7 time interactions were observed for subjective measures of pain (F\u00a0= 0.102;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.959) or soreness (F\u00a0= 0.886;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.455). No significant main effect for time was observed for subjective levels of pain (F\u00a0= 1.085;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.351); however, a significant main effect for time was observed for subjective levels of muscle soreness (F\u00a0= 7.319;\u00a0p\u00a0= < 0.001) in both groups combined. Muscle soreness was significantly higher at 30P (p\u00a0= 0.001), 24 H (p\u00a0= 0.001), and 48 H (p\u00a0= 0.002) compared with BL.\nUltrasound Assessment\nChanges in muscle CSA and MT can be observed in\u00a0Table 3. No significant group \u00d7 time interactions were observed for muscle CSA (F\u00a0= 0.246;\u00a0p\u00a00.747) or MT (F\u00a0= 0.687;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.530). However, a significant main effect for time was observed for both CSA (F\u00a0= 13.460;\u00a0p\u00a0< 0.001) and MT (F\u00a0= 3.685;\u00a0p\u00a0= 0.028). Muscle CSA and MT were significantly greater at IP (p\u00a0< 0.001) compared with BL.\nDiscussion\nResults of this study indicated no differences in the recovery response between YA and MA for any of the performance measures, nor in subjective levels of muscle pain or soreness. Furthermore, no between-group differences were observed in the inflammatory or\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0response to the exercise protocol. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine differences in the recovery response from high-volume resistance exercise between recreationally trained young and middle-aged adults. Our results comparing BL performance measures seem to be in agreement with other investigations, demonstrating differences in strength measures between young (23\u009629 years) and older adults (60\u009665 years) (7,15,24), and between middle-aged (41\u009642 years) and older adults (70\u009672 years) (17,18). It does seem that the decline in strength may develop during middle age. However, recovery from exercise seems to be comparable in both younger and middle-aged adults as reflected by similar changes in performance and markers of\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0and\u00a0inflammation. Although changes in strength may occur in middle age, recovery from exercise does seem to be maintained in recreationally trained individuals.\nThe differences observed at BL in isometric force and the rate of force development is consistent with other investigations comparing younger and older adults (16,19,36). Although differences in age between young and middle-aged adults do seem to affect BL levels of strength, it does not seem to affect recovery from exercise. This is supported by similar patterns of\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0and\u00a0inflammation\u00a0observed during the recovery period after the HVP. Elevations in Mb and CK concentrations are consistent with the expected physiological response from a bout of resistance exercise (9,34). These results also suggest that middle-aged recreationally active men who regularly engage in\u00a0resistance training\u00a0do not seem to be at increased risk for greater soreness or\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0in comparison with younger recreationally trained men.\nSimilar response patterns were also noted in the inflammatory response for both groups. No significant elevations from BL were observed in CRP. However, significant increases in IL-6 concentrations were observed for both groups. Although CRP is an acute phase protein whose function is to activate the innate immune response and enhance phagocytosis (10), it does not seem to change after an acute bout of resistance exercise (6). Previous research has reported no significant changes in CRP concentrations after\u00a0resistance training\u00a0protocols recruiting primarily both upper-body (31) and lower-body exercises (4) in younger men. Furthermore, previous investigations have also indicated that training experience can reduce the CRP response to an acute bout of exercise (22,35). Considering that participants in both YA and MA were recreationally trained, it is likely that this training experience may have attenuated the CRP response. Physiologically, it is consistent with the lower stress and damage that occurs with repetitive training (9,35). Interleukin-6 is an inflammatory cytokine that facilitates communication for the mobilization, proliferation, and differentiation of immune cells to the site of tissue damage (6) and has been shown to increase after exercise (11). Elevations in IL-6 are related to the intensity, duration, and mode of training (11,13,32), but the literature is inconclusive regarding the IL-6 response to\u00a0resistance training. A recent study reported that a bout of high-volume resistance exercise (8 sets of 10 repetitions with 70% of maximal strength in the squat exercise) resulted in a significant elevation in IL-6 concentrations 30 min after exercise, but no changes were observed after a bout of high-intensity resistance exercise (8 sets of 3 repetitions with 90% of maximal strength in the squat exercise) in experienced, trained lifters (4). The IL-6 response observed during this investigation as a result of a bout of high-volume resistance exercise seems to be consistent with that recently reported by Bartolomei et al. (4). However, age did not seem to exacerbate nor attenuate the IL-6 response in recreationally trained participants.\nNo differences were noted in the inflammatory or\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0response between YA and MA. As discussed earlier, this is likely related to the recreational training background of the participants. However, there were several limitations to the study that need to be acknowledged. The exercise protocol was performed on an isokinetic dynamometer, which may not have as much practical application as most\u00a0resistance training\u00a0programs use dynamic constant resistance exercises. In addition, unilateral, single-joint exercise recruited a relatively smaller muscle mass than is commonly used in most training programs. The use of this modality of exercise, which has been demonstrated to be very effective in eliciting\u00a0muscle damage\u00a0(20,30), may not have been sufficient to elicit significant performance and inflammatory changes in these recreationally trained participants. Future research should examine modes of training specific to the typical training program of the participants.\nPractical Applications\nThe results of this study indicate that changes in muscle performance seem to begin during middle age, even in recreationally trained individuals. However, participating in recreational\u00a0resistance training\u00a0may mitigate any alteration in the recovery response from exercise. These results should be examined in the context that recovery was investigated after a unilateral, single-joint isokinetic exercise protocol. Although this method has been previously used as an effective mode of exercise to elicit\u00a0muscle damage, it is not specific to the type of exercises typically used by recreational lifters.

The accompanying increased prevalences of chronic illnesses, loss of musculoskeletal mass, frailty, and bone fragility increase the risk of falls and fractures.1 Loss of independence increases the number of people needing full time institutionalised care, the source of around 30% of all hip fractures in the community.2 Thus, targeting an intervention to all aged care residents is a rational approach to reducing the fracture burden in the whole community.\nThe widespread use of antiresorptive therapy is unlikely to reduce this fracture burden because of a paucity of evidence of antifracture efficacy in people over 80 years of age, the common occurrence of adverse events, and high cost given the large numbers of people that must be treated.3 However, these people often have calcium intakes below 700 mg daily, an amount unlikely to offset obligatory loss of calcium.4 They also often have protein intakes below 1 g/kg body weight/day, predisposing to loss of lean muscle mass.5 Thus, an alternative approach is to target all institutionalised older adults with a non-pharmaceutical nutritional intervention.\nFew studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of a nutritional approach to reduction of fracture risk in aged care residents. Chapuy and colleagues showed antifracture efficacy with pharmacological doses of calcium and vitamin D in female nursing home residents with low calcium intakes and vitamin D deficiency.6 No studies have examined the effects of protein supplementation on reduction of fracture risk, despite evidence of improved muscle function and reduced falls.7\nConsumption of milk, yoghurt, and cheese, foods rich in calcium and protein, slows bone loss and improves insulin-like growth factor 1.89 These foods are widely available, palatable, and low cost and so are likely to be adhered to. Accordingly, we conducted a prospective, two year, cluster randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that achieving recommended intakes of 1300 mg/day calcium and 1 g protein/kg body weight will reduce the risk of fragility fractures and falls when targeted to institutionalised older adults replete in vitamin D but with intakes below these levels.\nMethods\nStudy design\nThis two year, cluster randomised controlled trial involved recruitment of 60 residential aged care facilities housing 7195 older adults in metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria, Australia, between December 2013 and August 2016. To ensure similar standards of care, we recruited only facilities accredited with the Australian Aged-Care Accreditation Agency that housed predominantly ambulant residents. These facilities are similar to residential care in the UK and assisted care facilities in the US. Facilities recruited were representative of charitable, private, and religious organisations, with an even distribution of small (?50 beds), medium (51-100 beds), and large (>100 beds) facilities (supplementary figure C). The ratio of women to men and the age of residents were representative of the national average.10\nInclusion criteria\nRandomisation was by facility, not by individuals. For inclusion, facilities were required to provide no more than two servings of dairy foods daily, which was assessed from menu audits, as this level of provision is associated with dietary intakes of <1 g/kg body weight and 600 mg calcium daily.11 Vitamin D adequacy is maintained in residents through routine supplementation as foods are not fortified with vitamin D. We included only permanent residents in data analyses\u0097that is, we excluded data from respite residents.\nRandomisation procedure\nThe unit of randomisation was facility, as the intervention was delivered to all residents by the food service at each facility. Eligible facilities were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either intervention (n=30) or control (n=30), with the control facilities maintaining their existing menus. The randomisation was done with the use of a computer, with block sizes being varied according to organisation (to ensure similar procedures and policies), and was stratified by geographical location (to ensure similar socioeconomic status). A statistician independent of the study did the randomisation and provided the concealed group allocation to the principal investigator (SI) who, in turn, conveyed this allocation to the facility. SI was not involved in any data collection. An organisation may have between two and 10 facilities, and randomisation was done within an organisation.\nConsent\nFacility managers consented to provide de-identified details of age and sex of residents, as well as access to all incident reports including those for falls and fractures. Reporting of all incidents of any nature is a mandatory requirement of all accredited aged care providers. The accreditation agency regularly audits incident reports. Facilities are sanctioned if breaches are observed, with potential for accreditation to be revoked and government funding terminated. Falls (time, location, circumstances, and outcome/injury), fractures, and other adverse events were verified from these incident reports. These reports were maintained at all facilities. An independent medically trained person blinded to study allocation verified fractures by using hospital radiographs and radiographic reports. Residents and families were informed of the study during regular meetings. A subset of 371 residents from all facilities voluntarily consented to have dietary intake recorded, medical records reviewed, blood sampling, and measurement of body composition, bone mineral density, and bone microarchitecture performed. A next of kin consented for an additional 345 residents to allow dietary intake to be recorded and medical records reviewed.\nIntervention\nWe classified dairy foods by using the Australian Dietary Guidelines, with a \u0093serving\u0094 defined as 250 mL of milk, 200 g of yoghurt, and 40 g of cheese.12 Lactose-free options were provided to accommodate the few participants (<0.001%) with reported lactose intolerance. Butter, cream, and ice cream were not provided, as they contain little calcium or protein. All facilities prepared and cooked foods on site. We assigned intervention facilities a food service dietician to assist food service staff to increase the provision of dairy foods at all meals and snacks. Methods used to increase dairy foods included use of milk powder to fortify milk used in recipes and beverages. Dairy based desserts and snacks were offered in place of less nutritious foods such as cakes and biscuits. Foods provided were based on the preferences expressed by the residents at intervention sites.\nDairy foods were provided in-kind by Fonterra International (New Zealand) and distributed by a commercial food distribution company not associated with the project (Bidfoods, Australia). Use of a single distributor ensured accurate recording of costs for all dairy foods provided, with invoices used to verify compliance data. During dietary assessments, foods and beverages were weighed on a food scale (\u00b11 g) (Sohnele Page Profi, Germany) at all facilities. During two days every three months, dieticians assessed compliance by using the validated visual estimation of plate waste, with data collected from 55 000 foods and beverages during the study.13 We used nutritional analysis software (FoodWorks, Australia) or the Australian food composition database NUTTAB 2010 to calculate nutrient intakes.\nData monitoring\nData safety monitoring was carried out by the Study Trial Review Board, which was provided with quarterly reports.\nOutcomes\nAs per the approved study protocol, all pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes have been reported. The primary outcome was time to fragility fracture. Secondary outcomes were time to fall and changes in bone morphology and biochemistry. The tertiary outcomes of all cause mortality and changes in body composition are also reported. Exploratory outcomes including quality of life and muscle function were not examined (see original and final study protocols). Fasting morning serum samples were obtained from 189 residents at baseline and 12 months for measurement of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (baseline only), C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (a measure of bone resorption), procollagen type 1 N propeptide (a measure of bone formation), parathyroid hormone (Roche Cobas E170), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (LIASON) (supplementary figure A).\nBody composition and bone morphology were assessed at baseline and 12 months in 72 residents (supplementary figure B). Total and appendicular (arms and legs) lean mass and fat mass were determined from total body scans, and bone mineral density was measured at the lumbar spine and femoral neck using dual x-ray absorptiometry (Prodigy, GE Lunar, Madison, WI, CV=1%). Volumetric bone mineral density (the amount of bone contained within the external volume of bone, in g/cm3) was measured at the distal tibia and distal radius by using high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (Scanco Medical AG, Switzerland, CV 0.5\u00964.0%).14 Cortical porosity was determined using automated image processing (StrAx1.0, Straxcorp, Melbourne, Australia).\nBlinding and sample size\nOnce a facility was randomised, only the principal investigator, food service research dieticians, facility managers, and food service staff were aware of the allocation. Data acquisition and analyses were carried out by staff blinded to group allocation (SP, XW, MB, AGZ, and TN). Residents were blinded to the study; permission to conduct the study was obtained from the aged-care provider and facility managers. Some of the intervention strategies were not visible\u0097for example, fortification of milk with milk powder or modification of recipes. Some residents may have been aware of some changes, such as provision of cheese and biscuits for snacks, but not the reason for the changes.\nThe sample size was determined on the basis of a hypothesised effect size and intra-cluster correlation coefficient (r). Under the hypothesis that the intervention reduces the risk of fracture by 30%, based on previous antifracture calcium/vitamin D intervention in this setting, and that r ranges from 0.10 to 0.50, the sample size needed was 25 to 50 residents per facility and 25 facilities per arm to achieve the power of 80%.6 From falls data, we used an r of 0.20 to calculate the sample size.15 To account for approximately 20% annual attrition, we recruited 60 facilities with a minimum of 50 residents per facility.\nAt the start of the study, 3980 permanent residents were living in the participating facilities. We refer to these residents as the inception cohort. Recruitment continued throughout the 24 months to ensure that the required sample size was maintained, so we included data from residents admitted to facilities that replaced initial residents lost to follow-up due to death or discharge in analyses. We refer to these residents as the replacement cohort. In total, an additional 3215 residents were admitted to facilities after the study had started. We obtained details of new residents and those lost to follow-up from admission and discharge records from each facility.\nAnalyses\nWe expressed baseline data as mean and standard deviation, with the unit of analysis being clusters. We expressed fracture incidence, falls, and deaths per 100 person years of follow-up. We used the product limit (Kaplan-Meier) method to determine the cumulative risk of an event. No data were missing for these primary and secondary outcomes. The duration of follow-up was based on date of study entry to date of an event. When no event occurred, duration of follow-up was date of study entry to date of study termination.\nAs individuals were \u0093nested\u0094 within clusters (facilities), the primary analysis was based on the mixed effects Cox\u0092s proportional hazards model; effects of intervention, age, and sex were fixed effects, and the facility was considered the random effect (see supplementary methods for additional statistical analysis). We expressed the results as a hazard ratio with 95% confidence limits. We used the \u0093coxme\u0094 package to estimate model parameters. We also used the Fine-Gray sub-distribution method with the \u0093cmprsk\u0094 package to do mortality competing risk analysis.\nWe tested between group differences in serum biomarkers and measurements of body composition and bone morphology at baseline with the weighted t test, with cluster being the unit of analysis. Biomarkers were log transformed if they were not normally distributed. We analysed effects of the intervention by using the mixed effects model in which the within person change in outcome was modelled as a function of treatment or control group, time of follow-up, age, weight, and sex. All analyses used the R Statistical Environment.\nAmendments to protocol and statistical analysis plan\nInitially, facilities were matched only by location to account for socioeconomic status. We also accounted for organisations, as they contributed varying numbers of facilities and had different policies and procedures. We included facilities providing less than two servings of dairy food daily, as dietary assessments for all residents was not feasible. We quantified two day instead of three day diets, as this was adequate to capture regular intakes.11 We did not assess osteocalcin, as sufficient information is obtained from C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and procollagen type 1 N propeptide. We used only all cause mortality as a tertiary outcome, as cardiovascular events were not obtainable and causes of death were poorly documented. We did not examine exploratory outcomes related to quality of life and muscle function, as unanticipated attrition reduced the sample size resulting in insufficient power to detect an effect of treatment. We did not include bayesian analyses and imputations, as no values were missing for falls and fracture outcomes (original and final study protocols).\nPatient and public involvement\nWe consulted aged care residents, providers, and food service staff after the initial feasibility study that guided the design of this intervention.16 The manuscript was read by non-academics.\nResults\nOf the 60 facilities, 54 completed the 24 month intervention (fig 1). One control facility and three intervention facilities withdrew after randomisation. Two intervention facilities closed at months 15 and 20, but we included the data up to the date of closure. At baseline, the two groups had comparable demographics and were vitamin D replete. Daily baseline calcium and protein intakes were 689 (SD 266) mg and 57 (16) g respectively (table 1; supplementary figure D).\nNutritional changes\nDairy food intake increased from 2.0 to 3.5 servings daily in the intervention facilities (fig 2). The additional dairy foods, equivalent to 250 mL of milk plus 20 g cheese or 100 g yoghurt, provided 562 (166) mg calcium, achieving 1142 (353) mg calcium daily, and 12 (6) g protein, achieving an intake of 69 (15) g (1.1 g/kg body weight) daily. In control facilities, residents\u0092 dairy intakes remained at less than two servings daily providing 700 (247) mg calcium and 58 (14) g protein (0.9 g/kg body weight) daily. No adverse gastrointestinal events related to the intervention were reported. No detectable within or between group differences in energy intake were observed during follow-up (fig 2). However, we observed group differences for the change in body weight (table 2). In absolute terms, no weight change occurred in the intervention group (0.3 (95% confidence interval ?0.8 to 1.4) kg; P=0.56). In controls, a weight loss of 1.4 (0.6 to 2.1) kg, (P<0.001) was due to a 0.3 (?0.6 to 0.0) kg decline in appendicular lean mass (P=0.03) and 0.8 kg (?1.6 to ?0.2) decline in total body fat mass (P=0.02).\nFractures, falls, and mortality\nDuring 90 557 person months of follow-up (mean 12.6 (8.9) months), 324 fractures occurred: 121 (3.7%) in the intervention group and 203 (5.2%) in controls\u0097a 33% risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.93; P=0.02). Post hoc analysis indicated that the incidence of hip fracture was 1.3% (n=42) in the intervention group and 2.4% (n=93) in controls\u0097a 46% risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.54, 0.35 to 0.83; P=0.005). The separation in cumulative incidence of fractures between the groups achieved significance at five months for all fractures (P=0.02) and hip fractures (P=0.02) (fig 3). Competing risk analysis adjusted for mortality showed that the intervention was associated with average reductions in fracture risk of 27% (hazard ratio 0.73, 0.58 to 0.92) for all fractures and 44% (0.56, 0.39 to 0.82) for hip fractures.\nThe cumulative incidence of falls was 57% (n=1879) in the intervention group and 62% (n=2423) in controls\u0097an 11% relative risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.89, 0.78 to 0.98; P=0.04). The separation in the incidence of falls between groups achieved significance at three months (P=0.04) (fig 3). All but one fracture was the result of a fall. Mortality did not differ between the intervention and control groups (27% (n=900) v 28% (n=1074), respectively; hazard ratio 1.01, 0.43 to 3.08; P=0.91) (fig 3). The numbers needing treatment to prevent any fracture, hip fracture, or a fall were 52, 82, and 17, respectively.\nTo explore the veracity of the observations made in the entire cohort (n=7195), we examined the effects of the intervention on fracture risk and falls relative to controls in a post hoc analyses of residents present at the start of the study (n=3980, the inception cohort) and residents added after its start (n=3215, the replacement cohort), separately. The inception cohort was older than the replacement cohort (mean 86.5 (8.1) v 85.2 (8.4) years; P<0.001). However, age did not differ between the intervention and control groups in either the inception cohort (mean 86.7 (8.2) v 86.4 (8.0) years, respectively; P=0.25) or the replacement cohort (85.1 (8.5) v 85.3 (8.2) years, respectively; P=0.601). We observed significant reductions in all fractures, hip fractures, and falls in the intervention group relative to the controls in both the inception and replacement cohorts (see supplementary figure E).\nBiochemistry and bone morphology\nThe subgroup providing data for biochemistry, body composition, and bone morphology did not differ from the entire cohort in age (mean 85.9 (8.2) v 85.6 (8.2) years), proportion of women to men (70% (n=74) v 69% (n=57)), and proportion with previous fractures (38% (n=40) v 39 (n=32)). As shown in table 2, at 12 months, we observed a 20.4% between group difference in serum C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (P=0.002), the result of no change in the intervention group and a 13.1% increase in controls (P<0.05). We observed no between group difference in procollagen type 1 N propeptide or parathyroid hormone, but we observed a 7.9% between group difference in serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (P=0.04), the result of a 5.9% increase in the intervention group (P<0.05) and no change in controls.\nWe observed a 1.8% between group difference in spine bone mineral density (P=0.04), the result of a 2.1% increase in the intervention group (P<0.001) and no change in controls. The 1.7% between group difference in femoral neck bone mineral density was not significant (P=0.09). The 3.3% between group difference in distal radius total volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.02) and 2.0% between group difference in distal tibial total volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.07) were the result of decreases at each site in controls (both P<0.05). We observed a 4.6% between group difference in distal radial trabecular volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.03) due to a non-significant decrease in controls and a 0.7% increase in distal tibia cortical porosity in controls (P<0.05).\nDiscussion\nThis nutritional approach using high calcium and high protein dairy foods to increase calcium and protein intakes in institutionalised older adults replete in vitamin D was associated with a 33% reduction in risk of fractures of any type, a 46% reduction in risk of hip fractures, and an 11% reduction in risk of falls relative to controls. We found no group difference in all cause mortality.\nMost interventions aimed at reducing fracture risk target a drug therapy to people with osteoporosis because they are at high risk of fracture. This approach confers a large benefit to the individual and does so cost effectively, because few people need to be treated to avert one event. However, averting fractures in small numbers of people at high risk does not reduce the burden of fractures in the community.\nThe population burden of fractures\u0097the number of events, morbidity, mortality, and cost to the community\u0097arises from the vast numbers of people with risk factors that confer a modest attributable risk to the individual.17 For example, most fragility fractures in the community arise among women with osteopenia (bone mineral density T score \u00962.5 to \u00961 SD) because they form the largest segment of the community.18 Likewise, most fractures attributable to nutritional inadequacy arise among the great many people with intakes of calcium and protein that are below recommended levels.19 This nutritional inadequacy confers a small attributable risk to the individual but accounts for a large attributable fraction of the fracture burden in the community as a whole. This is the Geoffrey Rose prevention paradox\u0097a community based approach producing a small benefit to an individual may still confer a large benefit to the community.17 Safety is essential because most individuals treated may derive little or no benefit from the intervention. For example, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension study reduced blood pressure by replacing a \u0093western\u0094 diet with a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, and low fat dairy foods\u0097an approach associated with fewer cardiovascular events.20\nComparison with other studies\nMost nutrition based studies assessing antifracture efficacy in aged care residents and people in the community used pharmacological doses of calcium with or without vitamin D.21 In a meta-analysis of 17 of these studies, only two studies reported a reduction in fracture risk\u0097a study of nursing home residents with calcium intakes <600 mg/day and vitamin D concentrations <50 nmol/L and a community based study in women and men ?65 years of age with mean calcium intakes of 700 mg/day.21 In the remaining 15 studies, poor compliance, large numbers of dropouts, and a low prevalence of the risk factor may have contributed to the null findings.2223 Benefits are unlikely if the prevalence of a risk factor (such as inadequate calcium and protein intakes) is low.24 For example, in the meta-analysis, reduction in fracture risk reported with treatment was confined to the 7272 individuals with calcium intakes <700 mg/day (risk ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.89), not the 45 241 individuals with calcium intakes above 700 mg daily.21 The reduction in fracture risk observed with calcium and protein rich foods in this study may have been the result of attention to several of the above factors. Compliance was optimised by supervised provision and consumption of the foods. Participants lost to follow-up were replaced by newly admitted residents. We intentionally targeted a cohort at high risk for fracture in whom low calcium and protein intakes were common and so were likely to partly contribute to the already high fracture burden in this community.\nMechanisms of fracture risk reduction\nThis nutritional intervention produced two unanticipated novel observations. The risk reduction for falls and fractures was detected by three and five months, respectively, and the relative risk reduction for fractures was similar to that found in trials using potent antiresorptive therapy to treat people at high risk due to osteoporosis. The two most likely explanations for each of these observations is a risk reduction for falls and slowing progression of bone fragility. Insulin-like growth factor 1 increased in the intervention group only, whereas the decrease in appendicular lean mass was confined to controls, consistent with the notion that protein intakes of 1-1.5 g/kg/day is needed to prevent protein catabolism and preserve or increase muscle mass in older adults, particularly those at risk of malnutrition or frailty.25 The increase in serum C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and deterioration in tibial and radial total volumetric bone mineral density in controls was not seen in the intervention group, consistent with slowing of bone loss and slowing of microstructural deterioration.26 These changes were modest, but slowing microstructural deterioration disproportionately reduces progression of bone fragility because fragility increases as a power function to the bone loss producing it.27\nMortality did not differ between the groups. Some, but not all, studies suggest that milk consumption is associated with increased mortality but consumption of yoghurt and cheese (fermented foods) with reduced mortality and favourable blood lipid profiles.282930 Fermented and non-fermented dairy foods were used during the intervention. Milk consumption did not differ between the intervention and control groups (data not shown).\nLimitations of study\nThe study has several limitations. Less than half of the participants had follow-up longer than 15 months. However, the reduction in risk of fractures and falls was detected within six months. Measures of dietary intakes and causes of secondary osteoporosis were obtained from the subgroup of 716 consented participants, not all 7195 residents, so compliance was monitored in about 10% of residents. However, recorded intakes of 55 000 foods and beverages are likely to be representative of all residents as most, if not all, food is provided by facilities. Assessment of body composition, bone morphology, and biochemistry was confined to a subgroup of residents. Attrition of these participants limited the power to examine differences in body composition, bone morphology, and biochemistry between the groups. Therefore, our ability to make inferences concerning the role of this intervention in slowing microstructural deterioration and loss of muscle mass is limited. Serum parathyroid hormone remained unchanged, perhaps owing to administration of around 1100 mg of calcium throughout the day as food, not as a single supplement of elemental calcium.31 Moreover, this intervention used whole dairy foods, so any potential benefit of other components of the dairy matrix cannot be determined.\nSummary and conclusions\nIn summary, ageing of the population is associated with a greater number of older adults needing full time institutionalised care. These individuals are often malnourished.5 Although the risk of fracture attributable to undernutrition may be small in an individual, the large number of older adults in aged care confers a large fracture burden in the community; institutionalised people are the source of about 30% of all hip fractures.217 A high calcium and high protein nutritional intervention reduced the risk of falls and fractures. This intervention was tailored to the preferences of the residents and was successfully delivered through the food service using regular retail milk, yoghurt, and cheese incorporated into existing menus. In conclusion, this nutritional intervention has widespread implications as a public health measure for fracture prevention in the aged care setting and potentially in the wider community.\n", "folder": "text/2023-06-20 full", "system_role": "You are a helpful assistant.", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 1000, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613", "qna": {"date": "2023-06-20 1431", "folder": "text/2023-06-20 full", "article_title": "Effect of dietary sources of calcium and protein on hip fractures and falls in older adults in residential care cluster randomised controlled trial", "system_role": "You are a helpful assistant.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613", "text": "Effect of dietary sources of calcium and protein on hip fractures and falls in older adults in residential care cluster randomised controlled trial\n\nIntroduction\nLongevity increases the proportion of older adults in the population.

Chapuy and colleagues showed antifracture efficacy with pharmacological doses of calcium and vitamin D in female nursing home residents with low calcium intakes and vitamin D deficiency.6 No studies have examined the effects of protein supplementation on reduction of fracture risk, despite evidence of improved muscle function and reduced falls.7\nConsumption of milk, yoghurt, and cheese, foods rich in calcium and protein, slows bone loss and improves insulin-like growth factor 1.89 These foods are widely available, palatable, and low cost and so are likely to be adhered to. Accordingly, we conducted a prospective, two year, cluster randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that achieving recommended intakes of 1300 mg/day calcium and 1 g protein/kg body weight will reduce the risk of fragility fractures and falls when targeted to institutionalised older adults replete in vitamin D but with intakes below these levels.\nMethods\nStudy design\nThis two year, cluster randomised controlled trial involved recruitment of 60 residential aged care facilities housing 7195 older adults in metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria, Australia, between December 2013 and August 2016. To ensure similar standards of care, we recruited only facilities accredited with the Australian Aged-Care Accreditation Agency that housed predominantly ambulant residents. These facilities are similar to residential care in the UK and assisted care facilities in the US. Facilities recruited were representative of charitable, private, and religious organisations, with an even distribution of small (?50 beds), medium (51-100 beds), and large (>100 beds) facilities (supplementary figure C). The ratio of women to men and the age of residents were representative of the national average.10\nInclusion criteria\nRandomisation was by facility, not by individuals. For inclusion, facilities were required to provide no more than two servings of dairy foods daily, which was assessed from menu audits, as this level of provision is associated with dietary intakes of <1 g/kg body weight and 600 mg calcium daily.11 Vitamin D adequacy is maintained in residents through routine supplementation as foods are not fortified with vitamin D. We included only permanent residents in data analyses\u0097that is, we excluded data from respite residents.\nRandomisation procedure\nThe unit of randomisation was facility, as the intervention was delivered to all residents by the food service at each facility. Eligible facilities were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either intervention (n=30) or control (n=30), with the control facilities maintaining their existing menus. The randomisation was done with the use of a computer, with block sizes being varied according to organisation (to ensure similar procedures and policies), and was stratified by geographical location (to ensure similar socioeconomic status). A statistician independent of the study did the randomisation and provided the concealed group allocation to the principal investigator (SI) who, in turn, conveyed this allocation to the facility. SI was not involved in any data collection. An organisation may have between two and 10 facilities, and randomisation was done within an organisation.\nConsent\nFacility managers consented to provide de-identified details of age and sex of residents, as well as access to all incident reports including those for falls and fractures. Reporting of all incidents of any nature is a mandatory requirement of all accredited aged care providers. The accreditation agency regularly audits incident reports. Facilities are sanctioned if breaches are observed, with potential for accreditation to be revoked and government funding terminated. Falls (time, location, circumstances, and outcome/injury), fractures, and other adverse events were verified from these incident reports. These reports were maintained at all facilities. An independent medically trained person blinded to study allocation verified fractures by using hospital radiographs and radiographic reports. Residents and families were informed of the study during regular meetings. A subset of 371 residents from all facilities voluntarily consented to have dietary intake recorded, medical records reviewed, blood sampling, and measurement of body composition, bone mineral density, and bone microarchitecture performed. A next of kin consented for an additional 345 residents to allow dietary intake to be recorded and medical records reviewed.\nIntervention\nWe classified dairy foods by using the Australian Dietary Guidelines, with a \u0093serving\u0094 defined as 250 mL of milk, 200 g of yoghurt, and 40 g of cheese.12 Lactose-free options were provided to accommodate the few participants (<0.001%) with reported lactose intolerance. Butter, cream, and ice cream were not provided, as they contain little calcium or protein. All facilities prepared and cooked foods on site. We assigned intervention facilities a food service dietician to assist food service staff to increase the provision of dairy foods at all meals and snacks. Methods used to increase dairy foods included use of milk powder to fortify milk used in recipes and beverages. Dairy based desserts and snacks were offered in place of less nutritious foods such as cakes and biscuits. Foods provided were based on the preferences expressed by the residents at intervention sites.\nDairy foods were provided in-kind by Fonterra International (New Zealand) and distributed by a commercial food distribution company not associated with the project (Bidfoods, Australia). Use of a single distributor ensured accurate recording of costs for all dairy foods provided, with invoices used to verify compliance data. During dietary assessments, foods and beverages were weighed on a food scale (\u00b11 g) (Sohnele Page Profi, Germany) at all facilities. During two days every three months, dieticians assessed compliance by using the validated visual estimation of plate waste, with data collected from 55 000 foods and beverages during the study.13 We used nutritional analysis software (FoodWorks, Australia) or the Australian food composition database NUTTAB 2010 to calculate nutrient intakes.\nData monitoring\nData safety monitoring was carried out by the Study Trial Review Board, which was provided with quarterly reports.\nOutcomes\nAs per the approved study protocol, all pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes have been reported. The primary outcome was time to fragility fracture. Secondary outcomes were time to fall and changes in bone morphology and biochemistry. The tertiary outcomes of all cause mortality and changes in body composition are also reported. Exploratory outcomes including quality of life and muscle function were not examined (see original and final study protocols). Fasting morning serum samples were obtained from 189 residents at baseline and 12 months for measurement of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (baseline only), C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (a measure of bone resorption), procollagen type 1 N propeptide (a measure of bone formation), parathyroid hormone (Roche Cobas E170), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (LIASON) (supplementary figure A).\nBody composition and bone morphology were assessed at baseline and 12 months in 72 residents (supplementary figure B). Total and appendicular (arms and legs) lean mass and fat mass were determined from total body scans, and bone mineral density was measured at the lumbar spine and femoral neck using dual x-ray absorptiometry (Prodigy, GE Lunar, Madison, WI, CV=1%). Volumetric bone mineral density (the amount of bone contained within the external volume of bone, in g/cm3) was measured at the distal tibia and distal radius by using high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (Scanco Medical AG, Switzerland, CV 0.5\u00964.0%).14 Cortical porosity was determined using automated image processing (StrAx1.0, Straxcorp, Melbourne, Australia).\nBlinding and sample size\nOnce a facility was randomised, only the principal investigator, food service research dieticians, facility managers, and food service staff were aware of the allocation. Data acquisition and analyses were carried out by staff blinded to group allocation (SP, XW, MB, AGZ, and TN). Residents were blinded to the study; permission to conduct the study was obtained from the aged-care provider and facility managers. Some of the intervention strategies were not visible\u0097for example, fortification of milk with milk powder or modification of recipes. Some residents may have been aware of some changes, such as provision of cheese and biscuits for snacks, but not the reason for the changes.\nThe sample size was determined on the basis of a hypothesised effect size and intra-cluster correlation coefficient (r). Under the hypothesis that the intervention reduces the risk of fracture by 30%, based on previous antifracture calcium/vitamin D intervention in this setting, and that r ranges from 0.10 to 0.50, the sample size needed was 25 to 50 residents per facility and 25 facilities per arm to achieve the power of 80%.6 From falls data, we used an r of 0.20 to calculate the sample size.15 To account for approximately 20% annual attrition, we recruited 60 facilities with a minimum of 50 residents per facility.\nAt the start of the study, 3980 permanent residents were living in the participating facilities. We refer to these residents as the inception cohort. Recruitment continued throughout the 24 months to ensure that the required sample size was maintained, so we included data from residents admitted to facilities that replaced initial residents lost to follow-up due to death or discharge in analyses. We refer to these residents as the replacement cohort. In total, an additional 3215 residents were admitted to facilities after the study had started. We obtained details of new residents and those lost to follow-up from admission and discharge records from each facility.\nAnalyses\nWe expressed baseline data as mean and standard deviation, with the unit of analysis being clusters. We expressed fracture incidence, falls, and deaths per 100 person years of follow-up. We used the product limit (Kaplan-Meier) method to determine the cumulative risk of an event. No data were missing for these primary and secondary outcomes. The duration of follow-up was based on date of study entry to date of an event. When no event occurred, duration of follow-up was date of study entry to date of study termination.\nAs individuals were \u0093nested\u0094 within clusters (facilities), the primary analysis was based on the mixed effects Cox\u0092s proportional hazards model; effects of intervention, age, and sex were fixed effects, and the facility was considered the random effect (see supplementary methods for additional statistical analysis). We expressed the results as a hazard ratio with 95% confidence limits. We used the \u0093coxme\u0094 package to estimate model parameters. We also used the Fine-Gray sub-distribution method with the \u0093cmprsk\u0094 package to do mortality competing risk analysis.\nWe tested between group differences in serum biomarkers and measurements of body composition and bone morphology at baseline with the weighted t test, with cluster being the unit of analysis. Biomarkers were log transformed if they were not normally distributed. We analysed effects of the intervention by using the mixed effects model in which the within person change in outcome was modelled as a function of treatment or control group, time of follow-up, age, weight, and sex. All analyses used the R Statistical Environment.\nAmendments to protocol and statistical analysis plan\nInitially, facilities were matched only by location to account for socioeconomic status. We also accounted for organisations, as they contributed varying numbers of facilities and had different policies and procedures. We included facilities providing less than two servings of dairy food daily, as dietary assessments for all residents was not feasible. We quantified two day instead of three day diets, as this was adequate to capture regular intakes.11 We did not assess osteocalcin, as sufficient information is obtained from C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and procollagen type 1 N propeptide. We used only all cause mortality as a tertiary outcome, as cardiovascular events were not obtainable and causes of death were poorly documented. We did not examine exploratory outcomes related to quality of life and muscle function, as unanticipated attrition reduced the sample size resulting in insufficient power to detect an effect of treatment. We did not include bayesian analyses and imputations, as no values were missing for falls and fracture outcomes (original and final study protocols).\nPatient and public involvement\nWe consulted aged care residents, providers, and food service staff after the initial feasibility study that guided the design of this intervention.16 The manuscript was read by non-academics.\nResults\nOf the 60 facilities, 54 completed the 24 month intervention (fig 1). One control facility and three intervention facilities withdrew after randomisation. Two intervention facilities closed at months 15 and 20, but we included the data up to the date of closure. At baseline, the two groups had comparable demographics and were vitamin D replete. Daily baseline calcium and protein intakes were 689 (SD 266) mg and 57 (16) g respectively (table 1; supplementary figure D).\nNutritional changes\nDairy food intake increased from 2.0 to 3.5 servings daily in the intervention facilities (fig 2). The additional dairy foods, equivalent to 250 mL of milk plus 20 g cheese or 100 g yoghurt, provided 562 (166) mg calcium, achieving 1142 (353) mg calcium daily, and 12 (6) g protein, achieving an intake of 69 (15) g (1.1 g/kg body weight) daily. In control facilities, residents\u0092 dairy intakes remained at less than two servings daily providing 700 (247) mg calcium and 58 (14) g protein (0.9 g/kg body weight) daily. No adverse gastrointestinal events related to the intervention were reported. No detectable within or between group differences in energy intake were observed during follow-up (fig 2). However, we observed group differences for the change in body weight (table 2). In absolute terms, no weight change occurred in the intervention group (0.3 (95% confidence interval ?0.8 to 1.4) kg; P=0.56). In controls, a weight loss of 1.4 (0.6 to 2.1) kg, (P<0.001) was due to a 0.3 (?0.6 to 0.0) kg decline in appendicular lean mass (P=0.03) and 0.8 kg (?1.6 to ?0.2) decline in total body fat mass (P=0.02).\nFractures, falls, and mortality\nDuring 90 557 person months of follow-up (mean 12.6 (8.9) months), 324 fractures occurred: 121 (3.7%) in the intervention group and 203 (5.2%) in controls\u0097a 33% risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.93; P=0.02). Post hoc analysis indicated that the incidence of hip fracture was 1.3% (n=42) in the intervention group and 2.4% (n=93) in controls\u0097a 46% risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.54, 0.35 to 0.83; P=0.005). The separation in cumulative incidence of fractures between the groups achieved significance at five months for all fractures (P=0.02) and hip fractures (P=0.02) (fig 3). Competing risk analysis adjusted for mortality showed that the intervention was associated with average reductions in fracture risk of 27% (hazard ratio 0.73, 0.58 to 0.92) for all fractures and 44% (0.56, 0.39 to 0.82) for hip fractures.\nThe cumulative incidence of falls was 57% (n=1879) in the intervention group and 62% (n=2423) in controls\u0097an 11% relative risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.89, 0.78 to 0.98; P=0.04). The separation in the incidence of falls between groups achieved significance at three months (P=0.04) (fig 3). All but one fracture was the result of a fall. Mortality did not differ between the intervention and control groups (27% (n=900) v 28% (n=1074), respectively; hazard ratio 1.01, 0.43 to 3.08; P=0.91) (fig 3). The numbers needing treatment to prevent any fracture, hip fracture, or a fall were 52, 82, and 17, respectively.\nTo explore the veracity of the observations made in the entire cohort (n=7195), we examined the effects of the intervention on fracture risk and falls relative to controls in a post hoc analyses of residents present at the start of the study (n=3980, the inception cohort) and residents added after its start (n=3215, the replacement cohort), separately. The inception cohort was older than the replacement cohort (mean 86.5 (8.1) v 85.2 (8.4) years; P<0.001). However, age did not differ between the intervention and control groups in either the inception cohort (mean 86.7 (8.2) v 86.4 (8.0) years, respectively; P=0.25) or the replacement cohort (85.1 (8.5) v 85.3 (8.2) years, respectively; P=0.601). We observed significant reductions in all fractures, hip fractures, and falls in the intervention group relative to the controls in both the inception and replacement cohorts (see supplementary figure E).\nBiochemistry and bone morphology\nThe subgroup providing data for biochemistry, body composition, and bone morphology did not differ from the entire cohort in age (mean 85.9 (8.2) v 85.6 (8.2) years), proportion of women to men (70% (n=74) v 69% (n=57)), and proportion with previous fractures (38% (n=40) v 39 (n=32)). As shown in table 2, at 12 months, we observed a 20.4% between group difference in serum C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (P=0.002), the result of no change in the intervention group and a 13.1% increase in controls (P<0.05). We observed no between group difference in procollagen type 1 N propeptide or parathyroid hormone, but we observed a 7.9% between group difference in serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (P=0.04), the result of a 5.9% increase in the intervention group (P<0.05) and no change in controls.\nWe observed a 1.8% between group difference in spine bone mineral density (P=0.04), the result of a 2.1% increase in the intervention group (P<0.001) and no change in controls. The 1.7% between group difference in femoral neck bone mineral density was not significant (P=0.09). The 3.3% between group difference in distal radius total volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.02) and 2.0% between group difference in distal tibial total volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.07) were the result of decreases at each site in controls (both P<0.05). We observed a 4.6% between group difference in distal radial trabecular volumetric bone mineral density (P=0.03) due to a non-significant decrease in controls and a 0.7% increase in distal tibia cortical porosity in controls (P<0.05).\nDiscussion\nThis nutritional approach using high calcium and high protein dairy foods to increase calcium and protein intakes in institutionalised older adults replete in vitamin D was associated with a 33% reduction in risk of fractures of any type, a 46% reduction in risk of hip fractures, and an 11% reduction in risk of falls relative to controls. We found no group difference in all cause mortality.\nMost interventions aimed at reducing fracture risk target a drug therapy to people with osteoporosis because they are at high risk of fracture. This approach confers a large benefit to the individual and does so cost effectively, because few people need to be treated to avert one event. However, averting fractures in small numbers of people at high risk does not reduce the burden of fractures in the community.\nThe population burden of fractures\u0097the number of events, morbidity, mortality, and cost to the community\u0097arises from the vast numbers of people with risk factors that confer a modest attributable risk to the individual.17 For example, most fragility fractures in the community arise among women with osteopenia (bone mineral density T score \u00962.5 to \u00961 SD) because they form the largest segment of the community.18 Likewise, most fractures attributable to nutritional inadequacy arise among the great many people with intakes of calcium and protein that are below recommended levels.19 This nutritional inadequacy confers a small attributable risk to the individual but accounts for a large attributable fraction of the fracture burden in the community as a whole. This is the Geoffrey Rose prevention paradox\u0097a community based approach producing a small benefit to an individual may still confer a large benefit to the community.17 Safety is essential because most individuals treated may derive little or no benefit from the intervention. For example, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension study reduced blood pressure by replacing a \u0093western\u0094 diet with a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, and low fat dairy foods\u0097an approach associated with fewer cardiovascular events.20\nComparison with other studies\nMost nutrition based studies assessing antifracture efficacy in aged care residents and people in the community used pharmacological doses of calcium with or without vitamin D.21 In a meta-analysis of 17 of these studies, only two studies reported a reduction in fracture risk\u0097a study of nursing home residents with calcium intakes <600 mg/day and vitamin D concentrations <50 nmol/L and a community based study in women and men ?65 years of age with mean calcium intakes of 700 mg/day.21 In the remaining 15 studies, poor compliance, large numbers of dropouts, and a low prevalence of the risk factor may have contributed to the null findings.2223 Benefits are unlikely if the prevalence of a risk factor (such as inadequate calcium and protein intakes) is low.24 For example, in the meta-analysis, reduction in fracture risk reported with treatment was confined to the 7272 individuals with calcium intakes <700 mg/day (risk ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.89), not the 45 241 individuals with calcium intakes above 700 mg daily.21 The reduction in fracture risk observed with calcium and protein rich foods in this study may have been the result of attention to several of the above factors. Compliance was optimised by supervised provision and consumption of the foods. Participants lost to follow-up were replaced by newly admitted residents. We intentionally targeted a cohort at high risk for fracture in whom low calcium and protein intakes were common and so were likely to partly contribute to the already high fracture burden in this community.\nMechanisms of fracture risk reduction\nThis nutritional intervention produced two unanticipated novel observations. The risk reduction for falls and fractures was detected by three and five months, respectively, and the relative risk reduction for fractures was similar to that found in trials using potent antiresorptive therapy to treat people at high risk due to osteoporosis. The two most likely explanations for each of these observations is a risk reduction for falls and slowing progression of bone fragility. Insulin-like growth factor 1 increased in the intervention group only, whereas the decrease in appendicular lean mass was confined to controls, consistent with the notion that protein intakes of 1-1.5 g/kg/day is needed to prevent protein catabolism and preserve or increase muscle mass in older adults, particularly those at risk of malnutrition or frailty.25 The increase in serum C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and deterioration in tibial and radial total volumetric bone mineral density in controls was not seen in the intervention group, consistent with slowing of bone loss and slowing of microstructural deterioration.26 These changes were modest, but slowing microstructural deterioration disproportionately reduces progression of bone fragility because fragility increases as a power function to the bone loss producing it.27\nMortality did not differ between the groups. Some, but not all, studies suggest that milk consumption is associated with increased mortality but consumption of yoghurt and cheese (fermented foods) with reduced mortality and favourable blood lipid profiles.282930 Fermented and non-fermented dairy foods were used during the intervention. Milk consumption did not differ between the intervention and control groups (data not shown).\nLimitations of study\nThe study has several limitations. Less than half of the participants had follow-up longer than 15 months. However, the reduction in risk of fractures and falls was detected within six months. Measures of dietary intakes and causes of secondary osteoporosis were obtained from the subgroup of 716 consented participants, not all 7195 residents, so compliance was monitored in about 10% of residents. However, recorded intakes of 55 000 foods and beverages are likely to be representative of all residents as most, if not all, food is provided by facilities. Assessment of body composition, bone morphology, and biochemistry was confined to a subgroup of residents. Attrition of these participants limited the power to examine differences in body composition, bone morphology, and biochemistry between the groups. Therefore, our ability to make inferences concerning the role of this intervention in slowing microstructural deterioration and loss of muscle mass is limited. Serum parathyroid hormone remained unchanged, perhaps owing to administration of around 1100 mg of calcium throughout the day as food, not as a single supplement of elemental calcium.31 Moreover, this intervention used whole dairy foods, so any potential benefit of other components of the dairy matrix cannot be determined.\nSummary and conclusions\nIn summary, ageing of the population is associated with a greater number of older adults needing full time institutionalised care. These individuals are often malnourished.5 Although the risk of fracture attributable to undernutrition may be small in an individual, the large number of older adults in aged care confers a large fracture burden in the community; institutionalised people are the source of about 30% of all hip fractures.217 A high calcium and high protein nutritional intervention reduced the risk of falls and fractures. This intervention was tailored to the preferences of the residents and was successfully delivered through the food service using regular retail milk, yoghurt, and cheese incorporated into existing menus. In conclusion, this nutritional intervention has widespread implications as a public health measure for fracture prevention in the aged care setting and potentially in the wider community.\n", "prep step": "Summarize the text for a LinkedIn post.", "summarization task": "In the summary, cover the following information:     \n- Identify the key points and statistics from this text that would make interesting or helpful health content.     \n- If available, include the effect sizes found in the research.

Despite the epidemic and its significant adverse medical sequelae [2,\u00a03], mechanisms driving such increases in obesity are not well understood. Overeating of highly palatable (HP) foods in the ubiquitous HP food cue environment and in stressful life contexts are known to contribute to weight gain and obesity risk [4-6], but underlying processes in these environmental contexts that promote overeating in humans is not well understood.\nHighly palatable (HP) foods are more liked, preferred and found to be rewarding in taste relative to less palatable foods. These HP foods include those high in sugar, with sweet taste, highly processed foods high in saturated fats or high carbohydrates making up savory tastes and combination of food groups prepared in ways that enhance taste and value or \u0091salience\u0092 of such foods to an individual. These foods are ubiquitous in our current obesogenic environment, and such highly palatable and processed foods and their related associations or\u0091cues\u0092 stimulate the brain reward and motivation pathways similar to reinforcing drugs of abuse, and via learning/conditioning mechanisms increase the likelihood of HP food seeking and consumption [4,\u00a07-11]. These HP foods are also associated with increased food cravings and intake [12], and consumption of fast foods such as potato chips, processed meats, sugar sweetened beverages all predict long term weight gain in large prospective cohorts of US men and women [13]. Despite such evidence that conditioned properties of HP foods increases greater food craving and promotes their intake, there are few experimental studies that examine the biobehavioral processes that may promote HP food craving and intake.\nStressful environments are also associated with greater food intake [14-16] and chronic stress levels are associated with greater weight gain and obesity risk [6,\u00a017-19]. Stressful experiences may increase demand for energy and promote gluconeogenesis and energy intake, that may also increase risk of higher food craving and intake [20]. Previous experimental studies assessing acute stress exposure effects on food intake have reported variable results [21-25]. While some research shows stress exposure increases high calorie food intake [17,\u00a024,\u00a026], others have shown reduced food intake with acute stress exposure in people with obesity [23,\u00a027]. However, this research varies by a number of experimental factors, including type of acute stressor utilized in the experiment, weight status of the participants, and type of food presented for intake and exposure time for food intake. More importantly, they have largely not addressed motivational status of the individual, i.e., food cravings, and whether stress increases food craving to promote HP food intake.\nBuilding on the previous literature from addiction models, where stress and drug cues each promote drug craving and facilitate risk of increased drug use [18], we conducted a preliminary experimental study to assess whether exposure to acute stress and HP food cues each increase food craving and intake in healthy lean and overweight individuals. We utilized a previously well-validated and extensively utilized individualized guided imagery method [28-35] for inducing stress, food cues and control neutral relaxing state in the laboratory. This was followed by assessment of HP food craving and intake in a food snack test (FST) after each exposure. Furthermore, as both cortisol and ghrelin have been associated with stress and with HP food intake [36,\u00a037], and are also altered by high BMI status [38], these hormones were repeatedly assessed throughout the study. We hypothesized that food cue and stress will each increase HP food cravings relative to the neutral control condition and that such increases in HP food craving will predict subsequent HP food intake. Furthermore, we hypothesized that significant changes in cortisol and ghrelin during food cue and with stress exposure, will be associated with HP food craving and intake.\nGo to:\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nScreening and Intake Procedures\nHealthy, non-smoking, non-substance using volunteers (12 men; 8 women; aged 18-45) were recruited from a community cohort of volunteers recruited from the greater New Haven area via flyers, radio, and social media advertisements. All volunteers completed medical, demographic, health assessments, including the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV-TR [39], Participants were excluded if they were cigarette smokers, had BMI above 38 due to risk of morbid obesity-related adverse health conditions, reported current dieting, met current DSM-IV-TR\u00a0dependence\u00a0criteria for any substance use disorders, or current other psychiatric disorders, including current eating disorders, had any current medical conditions and illnesses or if they were taking any medications. From 54 volunteers screened for this study, 16 were ineligible pertaining to these exclusions, while the others declined participation due to time constraints and changing their mind. Participants underwent breath alcohol testing, carbon monoxide testing, and urine toxicology screens to confirm being drug-free at each study appointment. Women who were pregnant, lactating or were on oral contraceptives as well as those who were peri or post-menopausal were also excluded. Participants received a physical examination by the admitting physician (JBG) to ensure all participants were in good health. Participants provided written informed consent and the study was approved by the Human Investigation Committee of the Yale University School of Medicine.\nScript Development and Imagery Training\nPrior to participation in the experimental procedures, all subjects participated in a structured interview session for imagery script development for the provocation of stress, food cue and control neutral relaxing contexts for the later laboratory experiment, as per our previously validated methods and structured manualized procedures [30,\u00a032,\u00a033,\u00a035,\u00a040]. Briefly, the stress imagery script was based on participants\u0092 descriptions of a recent personally stressful event which made them \u0093sad, mad, or upset, and with little control over the situation in the moment,\u0094 and that was experienced as \u0093most stressful.\u0094 \u0093Most stressful\u0094 was determined by assessing perceived stress on a 10-point Likert scale where 1 = not at all stressful and 10 = the most stress they felt in the past year. Individual calibration of stressful situations was conducted by only accepting situations rated as 8 or above as appropriate for script development. Stressful situations involving food intake or eating contexts were not allowed. The food cue scripts were developed by participants identifying a recent situation that included their favorite HP food-related stimuli and subsequent intake of those HP foods. Favorite food intake situations that were associated with negative affect or psychological distress were not allowed. A neutral-relaxing, non-physiologically arousing, and non-food related script was developed from the participants\u0092 description of a personally relaxing situation to serve as a control condition (See\u00a0Appendix A\u00a0for sample imagery scripts).\nImagery Training and Habituation Session:\u00a0\nParticipants were also provided with training in progressive relaxation and mental imagery in a 40 minute session prior to experimental sessions on Day 1 of admission as described below. During this session, an Intravenous (IV) heparin-treated catheter was inserted by the research nurse in the antecubital region of the participant\u0092s non-preferred arm for the participant to habituate to any potential stress of the IV insertion. No blood was drawn during this training session. The procedures for the training are outlined in the imagery training manual [40] and in previous work [30]. Briefly the progressive muscle relaxation procedure involved learning to monitor the tension in specific muscle groups by first tensing each muscle group, then releasing the tension, while directing attention towards the differences felt during tension and relaxation.\nExperimental Procedures:\nParticipants were admitted for a three-day, 2-night stay at the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation-Hospital Research Unit (HRU) located at the Yale New Haven Hospital, to ensure a controlled environment during the 3-day experiment. Upon admission on day 1, subjects were trained in progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery and habituated to the IV insertion, as per our previous work and as outlined in the personalized imagery procedures training manual [40]. On each experimental day, participants were brought into the testing room at 2:00PM, after eating a standard healthy lunch at noon. A heparin-treated catheter was inserted by the research nurse in the antecubital region of the participant\u0092s non-preferred arm. A 45-minute adaptation period followed, after which baseline plasma samples were drawn and subjective anxiety and food craving assessments were conducted before and after a 20 minute progressive relaxation procedure. Next, participants were provided with headphones and exposed to an audio recording of the 5-minute personalized guided imagery script of either their stress, food cue, or neutral-relaxing scenarios, only one condition per day in a randomized and counterbalanced order of presentation across subjects. We instructed participants to:\u00a0\u0093Close your eyes and imagine the situation being described, \u0091as if\u0092 it were happening right now. Let your body and mind get completely involved in the situation, doing what you would do in the real situation.\u0094\u00a0Immediately following imagery exposure on each day, and after blood draws and assessments, participants were presented with the food snack test (FST) which comprised 4 bowls of HP snacks of one each of chocolate pudding, potato chips, popcorn and mini chocolate chip cookies, and two bowls of healthy snacks of baby carrots and grapes, each portioned to ~500 calories (3000 calories per lab session). The presentation of the FST with HP foods serves as discrete HP food cues presented after imagery to assess effects on food motivation prior to food intake. Participants were then provided with the following instructions:\u00a0\u0093There are 6 bowls of different snacks on the tray. We will leave these here for the next hour and you can eat as much or as little as you like during the next hour\u0094.\u00a0All subjects were also videotaped for observed eating behavior coding. During this period, participants were not allowed to watch movies or do other activities but did have access to their phones. At the end of the hour, the tray was removed and the total calories consumed from each bowl of HP and healthy snacks was measured after each session as a measure of behavioral HP food motivation and intake. Food craving, anxiety, bloods draws for cortisol and ghrelin assessments were made at repeated timepoints throughout the session (Figure 1). All research staff were blind to the condition on each day as audiotapes were only marked by day and not by condition, which allowed for all assessments being conducted in a blinded manner.\nDependent Measures\nHP Food Craving\u00a0\nA brief 6-item food craving scale (FCS) was derived from the well-validated\u00a0Food Craving Inventory\u00a0(FCI, [41]), and included highly rated select high sugar, carbohydrate and fat items, for repeated assessment of food craving in an experimental setting. The specific FCI items rated included in the laboratory FCS were pizza, brownie, chocolate, cookies, ice cream and steak (on a 7 point scale). A total HP food craving score (sum of ratings) was computed at each timepoint of assessment as shown in\u00a0Figure 1.\nSubjective Anxiety Ratings\u00a0\nSubjective anxiety was rated on a 11-point scale anchored at 0 for \u0093not at all\u0094 and 10 for \u0093extremely anxious\u0094 measured at each assessment timepoint per session as shown in\u00a0Figure 1.\nMeasurement of Cortisol and Ghrelin\u00a0\nPlasma samples (8 mL) were collected at the same 8 consecutive time-points as food craving on each day (Figure 1). All plasma samples were collected in heparinized tubes that were immediately placed on ice after drawing. Within 30 minutes of collection, the blood was centrifuged at 4\u00b0C and the plasma was pooled and aliquoted for cortisol and for total ghrelin assays. All tubes were stored at ?70\u00b0C and analyzed using standard radioimmunoassay procedures as reported previously [19,\u00a031].\nFood Snack Test (FST) Calories Consumed:\u00a0\nAll snacks were carefully weighed and 500 calories of the snack foods of chocolate pudding, potato chips, popcorn, mini chocolate chip cookies, baby carrots and grapes were portioned into their respective bowls prior to each session as shown in\u00a0Figure 1. After the one-hour snacking period in each session, the amount of food snack consumed from each bowl was computed and the calories for each food was recorded, with a maximum of 500 calories per bowl for a total of 3000 calories for each laboratory session per day. HP food calories was a sum of the chocolate chip cookies, chocolate pudding, popcorn and potato chips, while the healthy food calories comprised the sum of calories of baby carrots and grapes consumed on each day.\nData Analytic Plan\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (SAS, Version 9.3) and all figures were created with GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).\nWe used Linear mixed effect (LME) models with a compound symmetry matrix structure for all analyses. The study design included the Between-Subjects factor of BMI [Lean(LN): below 25; Overweight/Obese(OW): 25-28] and Within-Subjects repeated factors, of Condition (Food cue, stress, neutral-relaxing) and Timepoint (baseline before imagery(?5), immediately following imagery(0), pre-snack timepoint prior to FST(+15), and 4 additional timepoints during ((+30, +45, +60) and post (+75) FST). Using these models, we tested the effects of BMI and Condition (food cue, stress relative to neutral cues) on food craving, cortisol, ghrelin and FST intake across time points. LME models in SAS also provide simple effects estimates with corresponding t-tests to deconstruct significant main effects and interactions. The specific contrasts were Stress (S) relative to neutral (N), Food Cue (FC) relative to N, and FC relative to N to deconstruct Condition main effects. In addition, BMI X Condition interaction effects were deconstructed with Condition effects as outlined above for each BMI group, and also for each Condition contrasting BMI groups, i.e., LN: S-N, FC-N, FC-S; OW: S-N, FC-N, FC-S; and LN vs. OW for S, FC and N conditions. In addition, Pearson product-moment correlation analyses were conducted to assess the relationship of pre-snacking food craving, cortisol and ghrelin and amount of HP food consumed during the FST.\nGo to:\nRESULTS\nThe subject sample comprised 12 men and 8 women, with 8 individuals with BMI\u0092s in the lean (LN; 38% women) and 12 in the overweight/obese (OWOB - BMI: 25-38; 42% women) range, with a mean age of 31.35 (SD: 7.39), mean education level of 15.2 years (SD: 2.07), mean IQ of 111.4 (SD:7.9), who were 35% Caucasian, 35% African American, 20% Hispanic and 10% Other. There were no differences between BMI groups on any of these demographic characteristics.\nPre-Snack HP Food Craving (FCS) and Subjective Anxiety Ratings:\nFor\u00a0subjective HP food craving, a significant effect of Condition (F(2,36)=12.74, p<.0001) and BMI Group X Condition (F(2,36)=4.93, p<.02) was observed. Simple effects t-test analyses indicated significantly higher food craving in the food cue relative to neutral (FC > N: t=4.92, p<.0001) and relative to stress(FC>S: t=3.45, p<.001). Simple effects for the BMI X Condition effect revealed the lean (LN) group showing greater craving only in the food cue relative to neutral condition (t=4.66, p<.0001), but the OW group showing food craving increases in both the food cue (t=2.27, p<.04) and in the stress (t=2.01, p<.05) relative to neutral conditions (see\u00a0Figure 2a).\nFor\u00a0HP FST intake, a main effect of Condition (F(2,36)=3.86, p<.03) was observed, indicating significantly higher levels of HP food calories consumed in the food cue (t=2.99, p<.01) relative to the neutral condition (Figure 2b). A trend level interaction of BMI Group X Condition (F(2,36)=3.31, p<.08) was also observed, resulting from greater HP food calories (HP FCAL) consumed in the food cue relative to neutral condition for the Lean (t=2.14, p<.04) only, but higher HPF CAL consumed in the stress condition for the OW relative to the LN group (t= 1.91, p<.05) (see\u00a0Figure 2b).\nFor\u00a0subjective anxiety, a significant effect of Condition (F(2,36)=8.7, p<.0008) and BMI Group X Condition (F(2,36)=3.71, p<.03) was observed. Simple effect contrasts revealed overall significantly higher anxiety in the food cue (t=2.02, p<.05) and in stress (t=2.11, p<.04) relative to the neutral condition, but this arose from the people with Lean BMIs showing no significant increases in anxiety across any condition, but the people with OW/OB BMIs showing increased anxiety in the food cue (t=2.10, p<.03) and in the stress (t=4.35, p<.001) relative to the neutral condition (see\u00a0Figure 2c).\nRelationship between Pre-Snack HP Food Craving and HP FST Calorie Consumed:\nPre-FST food craving scores (FCS_PreSnack) were found to be highly correlated with subsequent HP food calories (HPF_CAL) consumed in the food cue (r=.82, p<.0001) condition across groups but not in the neutral condition (r=.31, p<.18). On the other hand, stress-induced food craving predicted HP FST intake only in the OW group but not in the Lean group (OW: r=.68, p<.02; LN: r=.55, p<.12) (see\u00a0Figure 3a\u00a0-\u00a0?-3c3c).\nTotal Ghrelin Response and Relationship to HP Food Craving and Intake\nOverall LME analyses revealed a Condition main effect (F(2,35)=5.61, p<.008), but no significant BMI Group X Condition interaction (F(2,35)=0.75, p<.48). The Condition main effect resulted from stress (t=2.88, p<.007) and food cue (t=2.97, p<.005) exposure each increasing ghrelin relative to the neutral condition (see\u00a0Figure 4a). Secondary exploratory effect of group differences showed that ghrelin increases during both stress and in food cue relative to neutral conditions was due to increases in those in the OW/OB BMI group (FC vs N: t=2.54, p<.02 S vs N: t=3.25, p<.003) and not the lean group (FC vs N: t= 1.78, p<.08; S vs N: t=1.12, p<.27) (see\u00a0Fig 4a). Association between total ghrelin increases in each condition and food craving and intake were also conducted and revealed that stress-induced, but not food cue-induced increases in ghrelin were significantly associated with HP food craving and intake, and only in the OW group (see\u00a0Figure 4b\u00a0-\u00a0?-4c4c).\nDISCUSSION\nThis preliminary study is the first to directly compare the effects of both food cue and stress exposure on HP food craving and HP food intake in a 3-day human laboratory experiment conducted within a controlled hospital-based setting with healthy community adults. As both the ubiquitous HP food environment and stressors are known to increase HP food intake and obesity risk, a direct comparison of these contexts could identify similar and differential processes that may underlie food motivation and intake. As hypothesized, and similar to our previous work in addiction [18], we found that exposure to both personal food cues and to personal stressors relative to a neutral relaxing control cue resulted in increases in HP food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods in a standardized Food Snack Test (FST), but with differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups. Furthermore, we found that increased food craving in these contexts was highly associated with subsequent amounts of HP food snack intake. Finally, both ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. Together, these results support the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.\nExposure to food cue imagery led to significant increases in HP food craving prior to the presentation of the FST at the pre-snack timepoint in both lean and OW individuals. Moreover, food cue-related increases in food craving predicted significant increases in HP snack intake across both lean and OW individuals. These data are consistent with a significant literature indicating that rewarding stimuli and their related contexts increase motivation and wanting of rewarding stimuli via conditioning and/or incentive salience mechanisms [4,\u00a020,\u00a042]. Also, a number of basic science and human neuroimaging studies have shown that food cue stimulus exposure increases food craving and activate brain reward and motivation regions [4,\u00a07-11,\u00a018,\u00a043,\u00a044]. Current findings further indicate that such food cue-related increases in HP food craving promote HP snack intake with greater intake of HP foods in the food cue context relative to the neutral relaxing contexts across individuals. These data validate the real-world contexts of advertising of HP foods to promote greater sales and intake of HP foods.\nIn contrast, we found a differential impact of stress on HP food craving and intake by BMI group where stress significantly increased food craving relative to the neutral condition, but only in the overweight and not the lean group. Furthermore, stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group, suggesting that food motivational processes may be relevant in identifying those who are vulnerable to stress-induced eating. Previous laboratory studies have shown mixed results with some showing stress increasing food intake [17,\u00a024], but others reporting no consistent increases in intake [23,\u00a045]. While the methodology has varied across these studies, current findings suggest the need for direct comparison of BMI groups and consideration of weight-related adaptations in assessing stress effects on HP food motivation and intake. Current findings are also supported by a growing literature suggesting that BMI-related alterations impact not only metabolic hormones but also stress and reward processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake [18,\u00a020,\u00a044]. Together our findings on food cue- and stress- related effects on HP food motivation and intake suggests differential effects by BMI, that may in turn, point to different mechanisms that may drive weight gain and obesity risk in individuals who are lean versus those who are overweight.\nOur findings also show differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin responses and their contribution to HP food motivation and intake. Stress and food cue exposure increased ghrelin responses, but significantly for the OW and not the LN group. Furthermore, only in the OW group was stress-induced ghrelin increases significantly associated with both HP food craving and subsequent HP food intake. While ghrelin has well known homeostatic effects on feeding function [46,\u00a047], recent focus has been on its role in both stress and mood regulation as well as in hedonically motivated feeding behavior, partially via its effects on mesolimbic reward circuits [37,\u00a048]. Findings indicate that ghrelin can shift preferences to high palatable foods and increase the motivational aspects of food reward [48]. Ghrelin is also known to increase with stress and is involved in regulating anxiety and mood (36,\u00a049-51). Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that ghrelin administration increases the neural response to food pictures in areas associated with hedonic eating (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and ventral tegmental area) [52]. Additionally, there is growing evidence that feed-forward circuitry between stress and food reward maybe partly mediated by ghrelin [52,\u00a053]. In the current study, as the effects were specific to the OW group, they suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions.\nFinally, our findings also showed differential effects of cortisol responses to stress and food cue exposure. Notably, there was a significant increase in cortisol in the food cue relative to the neutral condition that was due to significant increases in cortisol in the lean group and not so in the OW group. Furthermore, food cue-related increases in cortisol was associated with greater food cue-related HP craving, suggesting a role for cortisol in food motivation. While glucocorticoids are often associated with the stress response, they are also known to play an important role in energy intake and regulation. Cortisol increases have been noted with intake of specific macronutrients, including carbohydrates, fats and proteins in animals and humans [6,\u00a054], with the source of cortisol increases to be via both adrenal and extra-adrenal production [54]. Furthermore, in our previous neuroimaging study, increases in cortisol during a mild hypoglycemic state was associated with greater activation of brain reward regions that promoted greater food craving [44]. Together, this previous research supports current findings of the association between greater cortisol responses to food cue exposure with food cue-induced HP food craving.\nWe did not see an overall significant increase in cortisol during stress exposure, but this was largely due to a lack of response in the OW group. Remarkably, the OW group showed blunted cortisol responses during stress and food cue relative to neutral conditions. This finding is consistent with growing evidence of blunted cortisol and autonomic responses to stress challenge in people who are OW or obese, along with altered autonomic and peripheral catecholamine responses to stress challenge in those weight groups [18,\u00a021-25,\u00a055]. HPA axis adaptations with low cortisol awakening responses have been reported in higher BMI groups, along with blunted responses to stress and reduced dopamine activity [20,\u00a056]. Thus, the current findings of lack of cortisol increases in the OW group leads one to speculate that such HPA axis adaptations may contribute to higher HP food craving and intake in food cue and in stress contexts. However, this is speculation and would need further testing in future studies.\nSeveral limitations of the current study need to be considered. First, the sample size was small and thus the findings are preliminary and need further validation. Also, due to the small sample size, sex differences and differential responses within the overweight groups were not assessed. It is possible that men and women differ in their food motivation and intake responses in food cue and stress contexts as shown in previous work [26,27]. Also, continuous assessment of BMI rather than arbitrary cutoffs for individuals in the lean, overweight and obese BMI range may provide greater sensitivity in assessing weight related adaptations. Thus, research with larger samples is required to replicate current findings and address these issues. Finally, as this study was conducted while participants were in a hospital, it is not clear whether the findings are generalizable to an outpatient experimental context or to real world food motivation and intake settings. On the other hand, as food cues and stress are among the most common contexts in which overeating of HP foods occur in the real world, the current study presents a well-controlled experimental model to study the biobehavioral processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake of highly palatable foods. Evidence of HP food motivation and increased snacking in these contexts is consistent with reports of obesogenic environments promoting increased HP food intake and weight gain in the real world. Furthermore, positive associations of HP food craving and intake by total ghrelin and cortisol responses suggests a role for metabolic and neuroendocrine adaptations in increased HP food motivation and intake.\n?\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n* This paper directly compares the effects of both food cue and stress exposure on highly palatable food craving and intake in a 3-day human laboratory experiment conducted within a controlled hospital-based setting with healthy community adults.\n* Results show that food cues and stress exposure increases food craving and subsequent snacking of highly palatable foods, and food cravings predict subsequent highly palatable food intake.\n* Ghrelin and cortisol hormones appear to play a role in food cue and stress related food motivation and intake.\n* These findings suggest the need for further carefully controlled studies to understand the biobehavioral processes that drive overeating and weight gain.\n\n", "folder": "text/2023-06-20 full", "system_role": "You are a helpful assistant.", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 1000, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613", "qna": {"date": "2023-06-20 1431", "folder": "text/2023-06-20 full", "article_title": "Food craving, cortisol and ghrelin responses in modeling highly palatable snack intake in the laboratory", "system_role": "You are a helpful assistant.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613", "text": "Food craving, cortisol and ghrelin responses in modeling highly palatable snack intake in the laboratory\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe United States is at the forefront of the global obesity epidemic with 67% of its population classified as overweight or obese (body mass index (BMI) ? 25kg/m2) [1-3]. Despite the epidemic and its significant adverse medical sequelae [2,\u00a03], mechanisms driving such increases in obesity are not well understood. Overeating of highly palatable (HP) foods in the ubiquitous HP food cue environment and in stressful life contexts are known to contribute to weight gain and obesity risk [4-6], but underlying processes in these environmental contexts that promote overeating in humans is not well understood.\nHighly palatable (HP) foods are more liked, preferred and found to be rewarding in taste relative to less palatable foods. These HP foods include those high in sugar, with sweet taste, highly processed foods high in saturated fats or high carbohydrates making up savory tastes and combination of food groups prepared in ways that enhance taste and value or \u0091salience\u0092 of such foods to an individual. These foods are ubiquitous in our current obesogenic environment, and such highly palatable and processed foods and their related associations or\u0091cues\u0092 stimulate the brain reward and motivation pathways similar to reinforcing drugs of abuse, and via learning/conditioning mechanisms increase the likelihood of HP food seeking and consumption [4,\u00a07-11]. These HP foods are also associated with increased food cravings and intake [12], and consumption of fast foods such as potato chips, processed meats, sugar sweetened beverages all predict long term weight gain in large prospective cohorts of US men and women [13]. Despite such evidence that conditioned properties of HP foods increases greater food craving and promotes their intake, there are few experimental studies that examine the biobehavioral processes that may promote HP food craving and intake.\nStressful environments are also associated with greater food intake [14-16] and chronic stress levels are associated with greater weight gain and obesity risk [6,\u00a017-19]. Stressful experiences may increase demand for energy and promote gluconeogenesis and energy intake, that may also increase risk of higher food craving and intake [20]. Previous experimental studies assessing acute stress exposure effects on food intake have reported variable results [21-25]. While some research shows stress exposure increases high calorie food intake [17,\u00a024,\u00a026], others have shown reduced food intake with acute stress exposure in people with obesity [23,\u00a027]. However, this research varies by a number of experimental factors, including type of acute stressor utilized in the experiment, weight status of the participants, and type of food presented for intake and exposure time for food intake. More importantly, they have largely not addressed motivational status of the individual, i.e., food cravings, and whether stress increases food craving to promote HP food intake.\nBuilding on the previous literature from addiction models, where stress and drug cues each promote drug craving and facilitate risk of increased drug use [18], we conducted a preliminary experimental study to assess whether exposure to acute stress and HP food cues each increase food craving and intake in healthy lean and overweight individuals. We utilized a previously well-validated and extensively utilized individualized guided imagery method [28-35] for inducing stress, food cues and control neutral relaxing state in the laboratory. This was followed by assessment of HP food craving and intake in a food snack test (FST) after each exposure. Furthermore, as both cortisol and ghrelin have been associated with stress and with HP food intake [36,\u00a037], and are also altered by high BMI status [38], these hormones were repeatedly assessed throughout the study. We hypothesized that food cue and stress will each increase HP food cravings relative to the neutral control condition and that such increases in HP food craving will predict subsequent HP food intake. Furthermore, we hypothesized that significant changes in cortisol and ghrelin during food cue and with stress exposure, will be associated with HP food craving and intake.\nGo to:\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nScreening and Intake Procedures\nHealthy, non-smoking, non-substance using volunteers (12 men; 8 women; aged 18-45) were recruited from a community cohort of volunteers recruited from the greater New Haven area via flyers, radio, and social media advertisements. All volunteers completed medical, demographic, health assessments, including the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV-TR [39], Participants were excluded if they were cigarette smokers, had BMI above 38 due to risk of morbid obesity-related adverse health conditions, reported current dieting, met current DSM-IV-TR\u00a0dependence\u00a0criteria for any substance use disorders, or current other psychiatric disorders, including current eating disorders, had any current medical conditions and illnesses or if they were taking any medications. From 54 volunteers screened for this study, 16 were ineligible pertaining to these exclusions, while the others declined participation due to time constraints and changing their mind. Participants underwent breath alcohol testing, carbon monoxide testing, and urine toxicology screens to confirm being drug-free at each study appointment. Women who were pregnant, lactating or were on oral contraceptives as well as those who were peri or post-menopausal were also excluded. Participants received a physical examination by the admitting physician (JBG) to ensure all participants were in good health. Participants provided written informed consent and the study was approved by the Human Investigation Committee of the Yale University School of Medicine.\nScript Development and Imagery Training\nPrior to participation in the experimental procedures, all subjects participated in a structured interview session for imagery script development for the provocation of stress, food cue and control neutral relaxing contexts for the later laboratory experiment, as per our previously validated methods and structured manualized procedures [30,\u00a032,\u00a033,\u00a035,\u00a040]. Briefly, the stress imagery script was based on participants\u0092 descriptions of a recent personally stressful event which made them \u0093sad, mad, or upset, and with little control over the situation in the moment,\u0094 and that was experienced as \u0093most stressful.\u0094 \u0093Most stressful\u0094 was determined by assessing perceived stress on a 10-point Likert scale where 1 = not at all stressful and 10 = the most stress they felt in the past year. Individual calibration of stressful situations was conducted by only accepting situations rated as 8 or above as appropriate for script development. Stressful situations involving food intake or eating contexts were not allowed. The food cue scripts were developed by participants identifying a recent situation that included their favorite HP food-related stimuli and subsequent intake of those HP foods. Favorite food intake situations that were associated with negative affect or psychological distress were not allowed. A neutral-relaxing, non-physiologically arousing, and non-food related script was developed from the participants\u0092 description of a personally relaxing situation to serve as a control condition (See\u00a0Appendix A\u00a0for sample imagery scripts).\nImagery Training and Habituation Session:\u00a0\nParticipants were also provided with training in progressive relaxation and mental imagery in a 40 minute session prior to experimental sessions on Day 1 of admission as described below. During this session, an Intravenous (IV) heparin-treated catheter was inserted by the research nurse in the antecubital region of the participant\u0092s non-preferred arm for the participant to habituate to any potential stress of the IV insertion. No blood was drawn during this training session. The procedures for the training are outlined in the imagery training manual [40] and in previous work [30]. Briefly the progressive muscle relaxation procedure involved learning to monitor the tension in specific muscle groups by first tensing each muscle group, then releasing the tension, while directing attention towards the differences felt during tension and relaxation.\nExperimental Procedures:\nParticipants were admitted for a three-day, 2-night stay at the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation-Hospital Research Unit (HRU) located at the Yale New Haven Hospital, to ensure a controlled environment during the 3-day experiment. Upon admission on day 1, subjects were trained in progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery and habituated to the IV insertion, as per our previous work and as outlined in the personalized imagery procedures training manual [40]. On each experimental day, participants were brought into the testing room at 2:00PM, after eating a standard healthy lunch at noon. A heparin-treated catheter was inserted by the research nurse in the antecubital region of the participant\u0092s non-preferred arm. A 45-minute adaptation period followed, after which baseline plasma samples were drawn and subjective anxiety and food craving assessments were conducted before and after a 20 minute progressive relaxation procedure. Next, participants were provided with headphones and exposed to an audio recording of the 5-minute personalized guided imagery script of either their stress, food cue, or neutral-relaxing scenarios, only one condition per day in a randomized and counterbalanced order of presentation across subjects. We instructed participants to:\u00a0\u0093Close your eyes and imagine the situation being described, \u0091as if\u0092 it were happening right now. Let your body and mind get completely involved in the situation, doing what you would do in the real situation.\u0094\u00a0Immediately following imagery exposure on each day, and after blood draws and assessments, participants were presented with the food snack test (FST) which comprised 4 bowls of HP snacks of one each of chocolate pudding, potato chips, popcorn and mini chocolate chip cookies, and two bowls of healthy snacks of baby carrots and grapes, each portioned to ~500 calories (3000 calories per lab session). The presentation of the FST with HP foods serves as discrete HP food cues presented after imagery to assess effects on food motivation prior to food intake. Participants were then provided with the following instructions:\u00a0\u0093There are 6 bowls of different snacks on the tray. We will leave these here for the next hour and you can eat as much or as little as you like during the next hour\u0094.\u00a0All subjects were also videotaped for observed eating behavior coding. During this period, participants were not allowed to watch movies or do other activities but did have access to their phones. At the end of the hour, the tray was removed and the total calories consumed from each bowl of HP and healthy snacks was measured after each session as a measure of behavioral HP food motivation and intake. Food craving, anxiety, bloods draws for cortisol and ghrelin assessments were made at repeated timepoints throughout the session (Figure 1). All research staff were blind to the condition on each day as audiotapes were only marked by day and not by condition, which allowed for all assessments being conducted in a blinded manner.\nDependent Measures\nHP Food Craving\u00a0\nA brief 6-item food craving scale (FCS) was derived from the well-validated\u00a0Food Craving Inventory\u00a0(FCI, [41]), and included highly rated select high sugar, carbohydrate and fat items, for repeated assessment of food craving in an experimental setting. The specific FCI items rated included in the laboratory FCS were pizza, brownie, chocolate, cookies, ice cream and steak (on a 7 point scale). A total HP food craving score (sum of ratings) was computed at each timepoint of assessment as shown in\u00a0Figure 1.\nSubjective Anxiety Ratings\u00a0\nSubjective anxiety was rated on a 11-point scale anchored at 0 for \u0093not at all\u0094 and 10 for \u0093extremely anxious\u0094 measured at each assessment timepoint per session as shown in\u00a0Figure 1.\nMeasurement of Cortisol and Ghrelin\u00a0\nPlasma samples (8 mL) were collected at the same 8 consecutive time-points as food craving on each day (Figure 1). All plasma samples were collected in heparinized tubes that were immediately placed on ice after drawing. Within 30 minutes of collection, the blood was centrifuged at 4\u00b0C and the plasma was pooled and aliquoted for cortisol and for total ghrelin assays. All tubes were stored at ?70\u00b0C and analyzed using standard radioimmunoassay procedures as reported previously [19,\u00a031].\nFood Snack Test (FST) Calories Consumed:\u00a0\nAll snacks were carefully weighed and 500 calories of the snack foods of chocolate pudding, potato chips, popcorn, mini chocolate chip cookies, baby carrots and grapes were portioned into their respective bowls prior to each session as shown in\u00a0Figure 1. After the one-hour snacking period in each session, the amount of food snack consumed from each bowl was computed and the calories for each food was recorded, with a maximum of 500 calories per bowl for a total of 3000 calories for each laboratory session per day. HP food calories was a sum of the chocolate chip cookies, chocolate pudding, popcorn and potato chips, while the healthy food calories comprised the sum of calories of baby carrots and grapes consumed on each day.\nData Analytic Plan\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (SAS, Version 9.3) and all figures were created with GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).\nWe used Linear mixed effect (LME) models with a compound symmetry matrix structure for all analyses. The study design included the Between-Subjects factor of BMI [Lean(LN): below 25; Overweight/Obese(OW): 25-28] and Within-Subjects repeated factors, of Condition (Food cue, stress, neutral-relaxing) and Timepoint (baseline before imagery(?5), immediately following imagery(0), pre-snack timepoint prior to FST(+15), and 4 additional timepoints during ((+30, +45, +60) and post (+75) FST). Using these models, we tested the effects of BMI and Condition (food cue, stress relative to neutral cues) on food craving, cortisol, ghrelin and FST intake across time points. LME models in SAS also provide simple effects estimates with corresponding t-tests to deconstruct significant main effects and interactions. The specific contrasts were Stress (S) relative to neutral (N), Food Cue (FC) relative to N, and FC relative to N to deconstruct Condition main effects. In addition, BMI X Condition interaction effects were deconstructed with Condition effects as outlined above for each BMI group, and also for each Condition contrasting BMI groups, i.e., LN: S-N, FC-N, FC-S; OW: S-N, FC-N, FC-S; and LN vs. OW for S, FC and N conditions. In addition, Pearson product-moment correlation analyses were conducted to assess the relationship of pre-snacking food craving, cortisol and ghrelin and amount of HP food consumed during the FST.\nGo to:\nRESULTS\nThe subject sample comprised 12 men and 8 women, with 8 individuals with BMI\u0092s in the lean (LN; 38% women) and 12 in the overweight/obese (OWOB - BMI: 25-38; 42% women) range, with a mean age of 31.35 (SD: 7.39), mean education level of 15.2 years (SD: 2.07), mean IQ of 111.4 (SD:7.9), who were 35% Caucasian, 35% African American, 20% Hispanic and 10% Other. There were no differences between BMI groups on any of these demographic characteristics.\nPre-Snack HP Food Craving (FCS) and Subjective Anxiety Ratings:\nFor\u00a0subjective HP food craving, a significant effect of Condition (F(2,36)=12.74, p<.0001) and BMI Group X Condition (F(2,36)=4.93, p<.02) was observed. Simple effects t-test analyses indicated significantly higher food craving in the food cue relative to neutral (FC > N: t=4.92, p<.0001) and relative to stress(FC>S: t=3.45, p<.001). Simple effects for the BMI X Condition effect revealed the lean (LN) group showing greater craving only in the food cue relative to neutral condition (t=4.66, p<.0001), but the OW group showing food craving increases in both the food cue (t=2.27, p<.04) and in the stress (t=2.01, p<.05) relative to neutral conditions (see\u00a0Figure 2a).\nFor\u00a0HP FST intake, a main effect of Condition (F(2,36)=3.86, p<.03) was observed, indicating significantly higher levels of HP food calories consumed in the food cue (t=2.99, p<.01) relative to the neutral condition (Figure 2b). A trend level interaction of BMI Group X Condition (F(2,36)=3.31, p<.08) was also observed, resulting from greater HP food calories (HP FCAL) consumed in the food cue relative to neutral condition for the Lean (t=2.14, p<.04) only, but higher HPF CAL consumed in the stress condition for the OW relative to the LN group (t= 1.91, p<.05) (see\u00a0Figure 2b).\nFor\u00a0subjective anxiety, a significant effect of Condition (F(2,36)=8.7, p<.0008) and BMI Group X Condition (F(2,36)=3.71, p<.03) was observed. Simple effect contrasts revealed overall significantly higher anxiety in the food cue (t=2.02, p<.05) and in stress (t=2.11, p<.04) relative to the neutral condition, but this arose from the people with Lean BMIs showing no significant increases in anxiety across any condition, but the people with OW/OB BMIs showing increased anxiety in the food cue (t=2.10, p<.03) and in the stress (t=4.35, p<.001) relative to the neutral condition (see\u00a0Figure 2c).\nRelationship between Pre-Snack HP Food Craving and HP FST Calorie Consumed:\nPre-FST food craving scores (FCS_PreSnack) were found to be highly correlated with subsequent HP food calories (HPF_CAL) consumed in the food cue (r=.82, p<.0001) condition across groups but not in the neutral condition (r=.31, p<.18). On the other hand, stress-induced food craving predicted HP FST intake only in the OW group but not in the Lean group (OW: r=.68, p<.02; LN: r=.55, p<.12) (see\u00a0Figure 3a\u00a0-\u00a0?-3c3c).\nTotal Ghrelin Response and Relationship to HP Food Craving and Intake\nOverall LME analyses revealed a Condition main effect (F(2,35)=5.61, p<.008), but no significant BMI Group X Condition interaction (F(2,35)=0.75, p<.48). The Condition main effect resulted from stress (t=2.88, p<.007) and food cue (t=2.97, p<.005) exposure each increasing ghrelin relative to the neutral condition (see\u00a0Figure 4a). Secondary exploratory effect of group differences showed that ghrelin increases during both stress and in food cue relative to neutral conditions was due to increases in those in the OW/OB BMI group (FC vs N: t=2.54, p<.02 S vs N: t=3.25, p<.003) and not the lean group (FC vs N: t= 1.78, p<.08; S vs N: t=1.12, p<.27) (see\u00a0Fig 4a). Association between total ghrelin increases in each condition and food craving and intake were also conducted and revealed that stress-induced, but not food cue-induced increases in ghrelin were significantly associated with HP food craving and intake, and only in the OW group (see\u00a0Figure 4b\u00a0-\u00a0?-4c4c).\nDISCUSSION\nThis preliminary study is the first to directly compare the effects of both food cue and stress exposure on HP food craving and HP food intake in a 3-day human laboratory experiment conducted within a controlled hospital-based setting with healthy community adults. As both the ubiquitous HP food environment and stressors are known to increase HP food intake and obesity risk, a direct comparison of these contexts could identify similar and differential processes that may underlie food motivation and intake. As hypothesized, and similar to our previous work in addiction [18], we found that exposure to both personal food cues and to personal stressors relative to a neutral relaxing control cue resulted in increases in HP food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods in a standardized Food Snack Test (FST), but with differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups. Furthermore, we found that increased food craving in these contexts was highly associated with subsequent amounts of HP food snack intake. Finally, both ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. Together, these results support the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.\nExposure to food cue imagery led to significant increases in HP food craving prior to the presentation of the FST at the pre-snack timepoint in both lean and OW individuals. Moreover, food cue-related increases in food craving predicted significant increases in HP snack intake across both lean and OW individuals. These data are consistent with a significant literature indicating that rewarding stimuli and their related contexts increase motivation and wanting of rewarding stimuli via conditioning and/or incentive salience mechanisms [4,\u00a020,\u00a042]. Also, a number of basic science and human neuroimaging studies have shown that food cue stimulus exposure increases food craving and activate brain reward and motivation regions [4,\u00a07-11,\u00a018,\u00a043,\u00a044]. Current findings further indicate that such food cue-related increases in HP food craving promote HP snack intake with greater intake of HP foods in the food cue context relative to the neutral relaxing contexts across individuals. These data validate the real-world contexts of advertising of HP foods to promote greater sales and intake of HP foods.\nIn contrast, we found a differential impact of stress on HP food craving and intake by BMI group where stress significantly increased food craving relative to the neutral condition, but only in the overweight and not the lean group. Furthermore, stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group, suggesting that food motivational processes may be relevant in identifying those who are vulnerable to stress-induced eating. Previous laboratory studies have shown mixed results with some showing stress increasing food intake [17,\u00a024], but others reporting no consistent increases in intake [23,\u00a045]. While the methodology has varied across these studies, current findings suggest the need for direct comparison of BMI groups and consideration of weight-related adaptations in assessing stress effects on HP food motivation and intake. Current findings are also supported by a growing literature suggesting that BMI-related alterations impact not only metabolic hormones but also stress and reward processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake [18,\u00a020,\u00a044]. Together our findings on food cue- and stress- related effects on HP food motivation and intake suggests differential effects by BMI, that may in turn, point to different mechanisms that may drive weight gain and obesity risk in individuals who are lean versus those who are overweight.\nOur findings also show differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin responses and their contribution to HP food motivation and intake. Stress and food cue exposure increased ghrelin responses, but significantly for the OW and not the LN group. Furthermore, only in the OW group was stress-induced ghrelin increases significantly associated with both HP food craving and subsequent HP food intake. While ghrelin has well known homeostatic effects on feeding function [46,\u00a047], recent focus has been on its role in both stress and mood regulation as well as in hedonically motivated feeding behavior, partially via its effects on mesolimbic reward circuits [37,\u00a048]. Findings indicate that ghrelin can shift preferences to high palatable foods and increase the motivational aspects of food reward [48]. Ghrelin is also known to increase with stress and is involved in regulating anxiety and mood (36,\u00a049-51). Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that ghrelin administration increases the neural response to food pictures in areas associated with hedonic eating (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and ventral tegmental area) [52]. Additionally, there is growing evidence that feed-forward circuitry between stress and food reward maybe partly mediated by ghrelin [52,\u00a053]. In the current study, as the effects were specific to the OW group, they suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions.\nFinally, our findings also showed differential effects of cortisol responses to stress and food cue exposure. Notably, there was a significant increase in cortisol in the food cue relative to the neutral condition that was due to significant increases in cortisol in the lean group and not so in the OW group. Furthermore, food cue-related increases in cortisol was associated with greater food cue-related HP craving, suggesting a role for cortisol in food motivation. While glucocorticoids are often associated with the stress response, they are also known to play an important role in energy intake and regulation. Cortisol increases have been noted with intake of specific macronutrients, including carbohydrates, fats and proteins in animals and humans [6,\u00a054], with the source of cortisol increases to be via both adrenal and extra-adrenal production [54]. Furthermore, in our previous neuroimaging study, increases in cortisol during a mild hypoglycemic state was associated with greater activation of brain reward regions that promoted greater food craving [44]. Together, this previous research supports current findings of the association between greater cortisol responses to food cue exposure with food cue-induced HP food craving.\nWe did not see an overall significant increase in cortisol during stress exposure, but this was largely due to a lack of response in the OW group. Remarkably, the OW group showed blunted cortisol responses during stress and food cue relative to neutral conditions. This finding is consistent with growing evidence of blunted cortisol and autonomic responses to stress challenge in people who are OW or obese, along with altered autonomic and peripheral catecholamine responses to stress challenge in those weight groups [18,\u00a021-25,\u00a055]. HPA axis adaptations with low cortisol awakening responses have been reported in higher BMI groups, along with blunted responses to stress and reduced dopamine activity [20,\u00a056]. Thus, the current findings of lack of cortisol increases in the OW group leads one to speculate that such HPA axis adaptations may contribute to higher HP food craving and intake in food cue and in stress contexts. However, this is speculation and would need further testing in future studies.\nSeveral limitations of the current study need to be considered. First, the sample size was small and thus the findings are preliminary and need further validation. Also, due to the small sample size, sex differences and differential responses within the overweight groups were not assessed. It is possible that men and women differ in their food motivation and intake responses in food cue and stress contexts as shown in previous work [26,27]. Also, continuous assessment of BMI rather than arbitrary cutoffs for individuals in the lean, overweight and obese BMI range may provide greater sensitivity in assessing weight related adaptations. Thus, research with larger samples is required to replicate current findings and address these issues. Finally, as this study was conducted while participants were in a hospital, it is not clear whether the findings are generalizable to an outpatient experimental context or to real world food motivation and intake settings. On the other hand, as food cues and stress are among the most common contexts in which overeating of HP foods occur in the real world, the current study presents a well-controlled experimental model to study the biobehavioral processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake of highly palatable foods. Evidence of HP food motivation and increased snacking in these contexts is consistent with reports of obesogenic environments promoting increased HP food intake and weight gain in the real world. Furthermore, positive associations of HP food craving and intake by total ghrelin and cortisol responses suggests a role for metabolic and neuroendocrine adaptations in increased HP food motivation and intake.\n?\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n* This paper directly compares the effects of both food cue and stress exposure on highly palatable food craving and intake in a 3-day human laboratory experiment conducted within a controlled hospital-based setting with healthy community adults.\n* Results show that food cues and stress exposure increases food craving and subsequent snacking of highly palatable foods, and food cravings predict subsequent highly palatable food intake.\n* Ghrelin and cortisol hormones appear to play a role in food cue and stress related food motivation and intake.\n* These findings suggest the need for further carefully controlled studies to understand the biobehavioral processes that drive overeating and weight gain.\n\n", "prep step": "Summarize the text for a LinkedIn post.", "summarization task": "In the summary, cover the following information:     \n- Identify the key points and statistics from this text that would make interesting or helpful health content.     \n- If available, include the effect sizes found in the research.

Chronic pain [i.e., pain that persists for ?3 mo (2)] in particular, affects ?20% of the global population (3, 4), with negative consequences to the individual, society, healthcare, and the economy. In the United States, the annual cost of chronic pain is estimated to be $635 million\u0097more than that of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes combined (5). However, chronic pain treatment has proven difficult due to the complex and multifactorial nature of pain (6). In a survey conducted across several European countries, 40% of chronic pain sufferers reported feeling dissatisfied with the effectiveness of their pain treatment(s) (4). Hence, more research on the mechanisms and factors contributing to a person\u0092s pain experience is needed. Given the various complexities of studying chronic pain (e.g., ethical, logistical, and medical considerations), such research is usually performed by administering various acute experimental pain stimuli to healthy individuals.\n\nRecent studies have shown that hypohydration can increase experimental pain sensitivity (7, 8). Mild hypohydration of <1% body mass loss, induced by prior fasting and exercise, was found to decrease pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) during a cold pressor task in men, compared with when they were rehydrated (7). These findings were supported in a later study, where subjective ratings of cold pressor pain in men were higher after 24 h of fluid restriction (1.4% body mass loss) than in the euhydrated condition (8). Similarly, a field study showed that hypohydrated cyclists perceived more intense pain in their leg muscles during an ultra-endurance race, compared with the euhydrated cyclists (9). However, these studies were primarily performed in men and the effects of hypohydration on pain in women have not been formally investigated.\n\nSeveral chronic pain conditions are more prevalent among women than men (10). Women also tend to display greater sensitivity to various experimental pain stimuli (11). Furthermore, pain perception in women may be influenced by hormonal fluctuations (primarily 17?-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle (12, 13). It is generally agreed that the severity of pain symptoms in several chronic pain conditions varies across the menstrual cycle (13, 14); however, whether the menstrual phase affects experimental pain sensitivity in healthy, pain-free women is still contestable (15, 16). The lack of accurate verification of menstrual phases and presence of various potential confounders (e.g., dysmenorrhea, dietary, and lifestyle factors) in many studies could explain the inconsistent findings (15). Some studies have attempted to address these issues (e.g., see Refs. 17 and 18), but such studies are scant and did not appear to impose a progesterone threshold to ensure only ovulatory cycles were included (19). Notably, none of the previous studies measured hydration status of participants at the time of testing, which may be influenced by menstrual phase (20, 21).\n\nThe ovarian hormones affect body fluid regulatory mechanisms (22), with potential implications for hydration status (20, 21). The mid-luteal phase (high 17?-estradiol and progesterone) is associated with an earlier release of arginine vasopressin (AVP)\u0097a fluid-regulatory hormone that increases renal water retention\u0097and thirst during exercise-induced dehydration or hypertonic saline infusion, compared with the early follicular phase (low 17?-estradiol and progesterone) (23, 24). This may potentially reduce the severity of dehydration for a given hydration challenge in the mid-luteal phase (20, 21). In the context of pain, this may suggest: 1) differences in the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration in the early follicular compared with mid-luteal phase, 2) potential variability in hydration status across the menstrual cycle may have confounded previous research on effects of the menstrual phase and experimental pain sensitivity, and 3) hypohydration may reduce the efficacy of pain treatments in women (21).\n\nImportantly, mild hypohydration appears to be common among women, with data from the United States showing approximately half of the 7,855 surveyed women meeting the hypohydration criterion (plasma tonicity > 295 mmol\u00b7L?1) (25). Therefore, the current study investigated the effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in women. We also examined whether the negative consequences of hypohydration on pain could be remedied by acute water ingestion. We hypothesized that 1) hypohydration would increase experimental pain sensitivity in women, 2) the magnitude of this increase in pain sensitivity would differ between the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases, and 3) acute water ingestion would reverse the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration.\n\nMETHODS\nEthical Approval\nThe study was approved by the Massey University Human Ethics Committee: Southern A (18/66). The study conformed to the requirements of the US Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (45 CFR, Part 46), and the standards set by the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki, except for registration in a database. All participants provided written, informed consent before all trials. Researchers were not blinded to the experimental conditions and analyses.\n\nParticipants\nTwenty-three healthy, eumenorrheic women initially volunteered for this study. As this is the first study, to our knowledge, that has investigated the effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase in combination, there was no reference study to base our sample size calculations on. As such, sample size was estimated from two previous studies; one on hypohydration and pain (? = 0.79 and effect size = 0.53) (8) and the other on a meta-analysis on menstrual phase effects on pain (effect size = 0.5 for ischemic pain, ? = 0.80) (12), which yielded required sample sizes of n = 17 and n = 27, respectively at an ? = 0.05. Therefore, we aimed for 17 > n < 27 and estimated the required number of participants for sufficient power to be n = 22.\n\nSix participants did not proceed with the experimental trials due to scheduling difficulties; thus, 17 women completed all experimental trials [means (SD): age, 28 (8) yr; height, 1.63 (0.07) m; body mass, 65.0 (10.8) kg]. Participants reported having regular menstrual cycles (i.e., 21\u009635 days) at the time of recruitment and had not used hormonal contraceptives within the past 6 mo. All participants were nonsmokers, had no pre-existing or history of medical, psychiatric, pain-related, or menstrual-related disorders (e.g., dysmenorrhea, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and premenstrual syndrome), and were not taking any medications. Taking into consideration these inclusion/exclusion criteria, women aged > 18 < 50 yr were recruited. All participants, except for one, were recreationally physically active, engaging in at least 150 min of structured exercise per week.\n\nExperimental Overview\nParticipants attended the laboratory on six occasions: two familiarization sessions, followed by four experimental trials. The four experimental trials were a full crossover of menstrual phase (EF and ML) and hydration status [euhydrated (EUH) and hypohydrated (HYPO)] and were performed over one or two menstrual cycles. The order of the experimental trials was randomized and counterbalanced, but the order of EUH and HYPO for each participant was maintained in the different menstrual phases. The experimental trials for each participant began at the same time of day (\u00b11 h) to minimize diurnal variation in pain sensitivity (26) and ovarian hormone concentrations (27). All trials were separated by at least 48 h and were performed under standard environmental conditions (22\u00b0C, 50% relative humidity, room illuminance of 600 lx).\n\nFamiliarization\nBefore the experimental trials, participants were familiarized with the ischemic pain test (see Ischemic Pain Test) on two separate occasions to minimize potential learning and anxiety effects. The first familiarization session also included measurement of participants\u0092 height and body mass (for calculation of fluid volume), and assessment of their maximal handgrip strength (see Maximal Handgrip Strength Assessment) to determine the absolute intensity for the submaximal contractions during the ischemic pain test. The number of familiarization sessions was determined from preliminary assessment of the time course of the learning effects, where pain outcome measures appeared to plateau after two sessions.\n\nMaximal Handgrip Strength Assessment\nUsing their nondominant hand, participants performed three maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) with a handgrip dynamometer (MLT003 Grip Force Transducer, ADInstruments Inc., CO) (28). Participants were asked to squeeze the dynamometer maximally for 5 s during each MVC, separated by 1 min of rest. Force output from the dynamometer was recorded (PowerLab, ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand) and displayed in real-time (LabChart Pro, ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand). Maximal handgrip strength was determined by calculating the mean of the peak values for the three MVCs. This assessment was only conducted once during the first familiarization session, rather than at the start of each experimental trial, to prevent potential effects of the MVCs on subsequent pain sensitivity (28). Furthermore, maximal handgrip strength does not appear to be affected by menstrual phase (19, 29) or hypohydration (30, 31).\n\nDietary and Lifestyle Control\nParticipants refrained from pain-relieving medications, alcohol, and strenuous exercise at least 12 h before the start of each experimental trial. Participants also maintained their habitual caffeine intake over this 24-h period to minimize confounding effects of caffeine on pain sensitivity (32) and psychological variables (33, 34). To prevent caffeine withdrawal during the hypohydrated trials, participants who normally consumed caffeinated beverages were given a caffeine tablet (No-Doz Awakeners, Novartis Consumer Health, Inc.) to take in place of the beverages. Participants recorded their diet, physical activity, and time to bed and wake (i.e., sleep duration) during the 24-h period before their first trial and were asked to replicate these for subsequent trials. Participants completed a dietary and lifestyle record sheet at the start of each trial to assess adherence to these instructions.\n\nMenstrual Cycle Phase and Hydration Intervention\nParticipants were tested during the EF and ML phases of their menstrual cycle to maximize the phase difference in ovarian hormone concentrations. The EF trials took place on days 4 (1) and 6 (2) and the ML trials on days 20 (2) and 22 (2), with day 1 representing start of menses and assuming a conventional 28-day menstrual cycle. Testing was scheduled using the three-step method (35) whereby self-reported menses onset and urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) testing (EasyCheck Ovulation Test, Phoenix Medcare, Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand) prospectively identified EF and ML, whereas measurement of serum 17?-estradiol and progesterone retrospectively confirmed ML. The EF phase was further verified by 17?-estradiol concentrations that were lower than in ML. Participants started daily LH testing 16 days before the end of a typical cycle until a positive LH test result was obtained (confirmed visually by the researchers), with ML trials then scheduled six to ten days after the positive LH test. To ensure ovulation had occurred and to minimize the likelihood of including anovulatory or luteal phase-deficient cycles, participants with progesterone < 5 ng\u00b7mL?1 were excluded from the final analyses (19, 36).\n\nTwenty-four hours before each trial, participants were instructed to either restrict fluid intake and avoid consumption of high-water content foods (>50%, e.g., soups, vegetables, and fruits) (HYPO), or to drink ad libitum (EUH). Participants recorded their food and fluid intake over this 24-h period retrospectively at the start of each trial (see Dietary and Lifestyle Control and Experimental Protocol).\n\nExperimental Protocol\nUpon the participants\u0092 arrival at the laboratory, a blood sample was obtained from the antecubital vein of the dominant arm via venepuncture. Participants then provided a urine sample and had their body mass measured. Urine specific gravity (USG) was measured immediately to confirm euhydration (USG < 1.020) or hypohydration (USG ? 1.020) (37). Participants then completed the dietary and lifestyle record sheet, Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (EUH only; see Measurements) and thirst ratings, followed by the ischemic pain test.\n\nImmediately after the pain test, participants ingested a glass of water (5 mL\u00b7kg?1 of body mass measured during the first familiarization) and finished it within 5 min. This volume of water was previously shown to produce an immediate decrease in thirst perception in hypohydrated men (38). A 30-min break followed, during which participants remained in the laboratory and performed their activity of choice (e.g., reading and watching videos) that was consistent for all trials. After the break, participants repeated the thirst ratings and ischemic pain test. The duration of the break was determined based on previous data that examined the reliability of pressure pain measurements taken before and after 30 min of rest (39). Pain thresholds at both time points were not different; however, pain ratings decreased after the 30-min break in women, but not in men. Although this suggests that more than 30 min may be required to ameliorate carryover effects, especially in women, we decided on 30 min to prevent boredom and restlessness since participants had to remain in the laboratory during this period.\n\nIschemic Pain Test\nThe ischemic pain test consisted of the Submaximal Effort Tourniquet Procedure (40). This experimental pain stimulus was chosen as it is more clinically relevant than other pain stimuli (e.g., noxious heat, mechanical pressure, and electrical stimulation) (41). A pneumatic cuff was positioned on the participant\u0092s nondominant arm, just above the elbow joint. The participant\u0092s arm was passively raised to a vertical position for 30 s to promote venous drainage. The pneumatic cuff was then inflated to 250 mmHg and a stopwatch was started. The participant\u0092s arm was immediately lowered to a horizontal position on the table, such that the forearm rests on the table with the elbow joint at a 90\u00b0 angle. To promote forearm ischemia, participants performed 25 handgrip exercises at 30% of their predetermined maximum handgrip strength (see Familiarization). Each contraction was sustained for 2 s and followed by 2 s of rest. Auditory signals indicated the start and end of each contraction. Participants received continuous visual feedback of their force output and the target force on a laptop screen.\n\nUpon completion of the handgrip exercises, the cuff remained inflated on the participant\u0092s arm and participants watched a nature documentary to standardize their attention throughout the remainder of the pain test. The volume of the video was maintained at 30% for all trials. One minute after the end of the handgrip exercises, participants rated their pain intensity and unpleasantness on a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) (42). Participants were asked to indicate verbally when they were no longer able or willing to endure the pain (pain tolerance). The stopwatch was then stopped; just before the cuff was deflated, participants rated their pain intensity and unpleasantness again, to verify that they had reached pain tolerance. Unknown to participants, a maximum time limit of 20 min was enforced for the pain test.\n\nMeasurements\nAnthropometric.\nParticipants\u0092 height and body mass were measured using a stadiometer (Seca, Hamburg, Germany; accurate to 0.1 cm) and electronic scale (Model X3M, HIWEIGH Technologies Limited, Shanghai, China; accurate to 10 g), respectively.\n\nOvarian hormone concentrations.\nVenous blood was collected into two 10 mL vacutainer tubes (Becton-Dickson, Oxford, UK). One tube contained clot activator for analysis of serum osmolality (Sosm), 17?-estradiol, and progesterone concentrations, whereas the other tube contained K3EDTA for analysis of plasma copeptin. The tube containing clot activator was inverted gently and left to clot for a minimum of 30 min at room temperature. The whole blood in both tubes was then centrifuged (Centrifuge 5804 R, Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) at 4\u00b0C and 260 g for 15 min to separate serum and plasma from whole blood. Aliquots of serum and plasma were then separated into three Eppendorf tubes (Genuine Axygen Quality) each and stored at ?80\u00b0C for further analysis. Commercially available enzyme-linked immune assays were used to measure concentrations of 17?-estradiol (Demeditec Diagnostics, Kiel, Germany) and progesterone (IBL International, Hamburg, Germany) in serum samples, with a sensitivity of 6.2 pg\u00b7mL?1 and 0.045 ng\u00b7mL?1, respectively, and an intra-assay variation of <6% and <7%, respectively. The ratio of progesterone to 17?-estradiol (P4:E2 ratio) was then calculated (43).\n\nHydration status.\nHydration status was assessed by measurement of Sosm, plasma copeptin concentrations, USG, ratings of thirst perception, and percent body mass change. Serum osmolality was measured via freezing-point depression (Digimatic osmometer Model 3D2, Advanced Instruments, Inc., Norwood, MA). Measurements were made in duplicate and averaged. If the two measurements differed by more than 5%, a third measurement was taken and the average of the two closest values was calculated. Plasma copeptin concentrations, a surrogate marker for AVP (44, 45), were measured with an automated immunofluorescent Copeptin proAVP KRYPTOR assay (B\u00b7R\u00b7A\u00b7H\u00b7M\u00b7S KRYPTOR compact PLUS analyzer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Henningsdorf, Germany), with a sensitivity of 1.08 pmol\u00b7L?1. Urine specific gravity was measured using a handheld clinical refractometer (Clinical Refractometer MASTER-SUR/NM, Atago Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Thirst perception was measured using pen and paper with a 10-cm VAS (46). Percent body mass change in HYPO was calculated from the EUH body mass within the same menstrual phase.\n\nPsychological variables.\nDepressive symptomatology was assessed using the CES-D (47). Given the 1-wk response timeframe of the CES-D, it was only administered once in each menstrual phase during the EUH trial.\n\nStatistical Analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software for Windows (IBM SPSS Statistics 20, NY). Descriptive values are reported as means (SD), unless otherwise stated. Data were assessed to ensure they were normally distributed and for sphericity, with no corrections needed. Data for Sosm, plasma copeptin, USG, body mass, 17?-estradiol, progesterone, and the P4:E2 ratio were assessed using a two-way (Phase \u00d7 Hydration) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). For thirst ratings, pain tolerance and pain intensity, and unpleasantness ratings, the data were analyzed by three-way (Phase \u00d7 Hydration \u00d7 Water) repeated-measures ANOVA. When main or interaction effects occurred for the two- or three-way ANOVA, post hoc pair-wise analyses were conducted using paired-samples t tests with Bonferroni correction, where appropriate. Data for CES-D and percent body mass change were analyzed using a paired-samples t test to compare means between menstrual phases. Bivariate Pearson\u0092s correlations were performed to examine the direction and strength of relationships between the main independent (i.e., hydration markers and ovarian hormone concentrations) and dependent (i.e., ischemic pain measures) variables measured at baseline (i.e., before water ingestion). All pairwise data were included in the correlation analyses to maximize statistical power. Effect sizes are reported as partial eta-squared (?2p\n) with demarcations of small (<0.06), medium (>0.06 and <0.14), and large (>0.14) effects, respectively (48). An a priori alpha of ? = 0.05 was used to demarcate statistically significant effects.\n\nRESULTS\nFollowing analysis of ovarian hormone concentrations, three participants did not meet the progesterone threshold of >5 ng\u00b7mL?1 and were excluded from subsequent analyses. Therefore, the following results are reported for the remaining 14 participants.\n\nSelf-Reported Sleep Duration and Depressive Symptomatology\nMean sleep duration across trials was 7.4 (1.6) h, which was not different between hydration conditions or menstrual phases (all P ? 0.15, ?2p\n ? 0.15). Incomplete data were collected for CES-D scores (n = 13). CES-D scores were not different between menstrual phases [EF: 10 (7) vs. ML: 12 (6); P = 0.55, ?2p\n?=?0.03].\n\nOvarian Hormone Concentrations\nBecause of the difficulty in obtaining blood samples in one or more trials for three participants, incomplete data were obtained for serum 17?-estradiol and progesterone concentrations (n = 11 each). Both progesterone [by 25.8 (25.9) vs. 0.5 (0.2) ng\u00b7mL?1; P = 0.009, ?2p\n?=?0.51] and 17?-estradiol [by 106 (58) vs. 52 (27) pg\u00b7mL?1; P = 0.001, ?2p\n?=?0.66] concentrations were higher in the ML compared with EF phase but were not dependent on hydration status (Phase \u00d7 Hydration: all P ? 0.46; ?2p\n ? 0.06) (Table 1). Accordingly, the P4:E2 ratio was also higher in the ML compared with EF phase (P = 0.005, ?2p\n?=?0.57) independent of hydration status (Phase \u00d7 Hydration: P = 0.78; ?2p\n?=?0.01). Progesterone, 17?-estradiol, and the P4:E2 ratio were all unaffected by hydration status (all P ? 0.46, ?2p\n ? 0.06).\n\nHydration Status\nBiochemical markers of hydration status obtained at baseline (i.e., before water ingestion) indicate that 24 h of fluid restriction was successful in eliciting mild dehydration (Table 2). Absolute body mass was lower in HYPO than in EUH (P = 0.006, ?2p\n?=?0.45) but this was not dependent on menstrual phase (Phase \u00d7 hydration: P = 0.31, ?2p\n?=?0.08). Therefore, average percent change in body mass from EUH to HYPO was 0.9% (1.3).\n\nBecause of the difficulty in obtaining blood samples, incomplete data were collected for Sosm (n = 10) and plasma copeptin (n = 9). Sosm was higher during HYPO than EUH (P = 0.001, ?2p\n?=?0.72) and was higher in EF than in ML (P = 0.03, ?2p\n?=?0.43), but these effects were not dependent on menstrual phase or hydration status, respectively (Phase \u00d7 Hydration: P = 0.22, ?2p\n?=?0.17). Both plasma copeptin (P = 0.04, ?2p\n?=?0.44) and USG (P < 0.001, ?2p\n?=?0.84) were also higher in HYPO than in EUH, but these were not dependent on menstrual phase (Phase \u00d7 hydration: both P ? 0.40, ?2p\n ? 0.09). In accordance with the significantly higher values of these biochemical markers, baseline thirst ratings were also higher during HYPO than in EUH (P < 0.001; ?2p\n?=?0.89), independent of menstrual phase (Phase \u00d7 Hydration: P = 0.67, ?2p\n?=?0.02).\n\nThirst Perception Ratings\nIncomplete data were collected for thirst perception ratings (n = 13). Overall, thirst was higher during HYPO than EUH [by 3.2 (1.2) cm; P < 0.001, ?2p\n?=?0.89] and was higher in ML than in EF [by 0.4 (0.6) cm; P = 0.04, ?2p\n?=?0.30], but these effects were not dependent on menstrual phase or hydration status, respectively (Phase \u00d7 hydration: P = 0.67, ?2p\n?=?0.02). Thirst ratings decreased after water ingestion (from baseline) by a larger extent during HYPO than in EUH [? 4.0 (2.3) vs. ? 0.6 (1.4) cm; Hydration \u00d7 Water: P < 0.001, ?2p\n?=?0.65], independent of menstrual phase (Phase \u00d7 Hydration \u00d7 Water: P = 0.47, ?\n2\np\n?=?0.05).\nIschemic Pain Tolerance\nOne participant was able to tolerate the ischemic pain for the maximum time limit of 20 min (1,200 s) in one trial (EUH trial in the ML phase) (Fig. 1). Her pain tolerance in this trial was therefore recorded as 1,200 s. Pain tolerance was lower during HYPO than in EUH [by 34 (46) s; P = 0.02, ?2p\n?=?0.37), independent of menstrual phase (Phase \u00d7 Hydration: P = 0.15, ?2p\n?=?0.15) or acute water ingestion (Hydration \u00d7 Water: P = 0.92; ?2p\n?=?0.001). Pain tolerance was unaffected by menstrual phase or acute water ingestion (both P ? 0.43, ?2p\n ? 0.05).\n\nIschemic Pain Intensity and Unpleasantness Ratings\nIncomplete data were collected for pain intensity (Fig. 2) and unpleasantness (Fig. 3) at 1 min after handgrip exercise (n = 12 each) because two participants had terminated the pain test before this time point. Both pain intensity [6.6 (1.3) vs. 5.9 (1.4) cm; P = 0.004, ?2p\n?=?0.55)] and pain unpleasantness [7.1 (1.3) vs. 6.4 (1.5) cm; P = 0.02, ?2p\n?=?0.40] ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise were higher during HYPO than in EUH, independent of menstrual phase (Phase \u00d7 Hydration: both P ? 0.15, ?2p\n ? 0.18). Both pain intensity (P = 0.004, ?2p\n?=?0.54) and pain unpleasantness (P = 0.04, ?2p\n?=?0.34) ratings increased after water ingestion (from baseline), independently of hydration status (Hydration \u00d7 Water: both P ? 0.50, ?2p\n ? 0.04) or menstrual phase (Phase \u00d7 Water: both P ? 0.53, ?2p\n ? 0.04).\n\nAt pain tolerance, however, both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness ratings were not different between hydration conditions or menstrual phases (all P ? 0.13, ?2p\n ? 0.17). After water ingestion, pain intensity ratings increased by 3.4 (0.6) cm from baseline (P = 0.04, ?2p\n?=?0.29) but pain unpleasantness was unaffected [+0.2 (4.6) cm; P = 0.10, ?2p\n?=?0.20], independent of hydration status (Hydration \u00d7 Water: both P ? 0.11, ?2p\n ? 0.19) or menstrual phase (Phase \u00d7 Water: both P ? 0.55, ?2p\n ? 0.03).\n\nCorrelations\nSerum concentrations of 17?-estradiol were negatively correlated with pain tolerance (r = ?0.31, P = 0.02) and positively correlated with pain unpleasantness ratings (r = 0.34, P = 0.02), but were not significantly associated with pain intensity ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (r = 0.23, P = 0.13). However, it should be noted that the strength of the significant correlations observed was weak (48) and therefore should be interpreted with caution. Neither progesterone nor the P4:E2 ratio was significantly associated with any of the ischemic pain measures (all r ? ?0.20, P ? 0.17). Similarly, no significant correlations were found between any of the hydration variables and ischemic pain measures (all r ? 0.20 and P ? 0.17).\n\nDISCUSSION\nThis study examined the independent and combined effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in healthy eumenorrheic women, and the potential efficacy of acute water ingestion as a remedy to the deleterious impact of hypohydration. The main findings were that: 1) mild hypohydration increased pain sensitivity, 2) menstrual phase did not affect pain sensitivity, nor did it influence the effect of hypohydration on pain, and 3) acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity.\n\nHypohydration and Pain in Women\nIndependent of menstrual phase, mild hypohydration following 24 h of fluid restriction reduced pain tolerance (?8%) and increased pain intensity (+13%) and pain unpleasantness (+12%) ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (hereafter referred to as pain ratings) during ischemic pain stimulation, when compared with euhydration. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies that showed negative effects of mild hypohydration on experimental pain sensitivity in men (7, 8). Ogino et al. (7) observed a decrease in pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) following a combination of exercise-induced dehydration and fluid restriction, whereas Bear et al. (8) found an increase in pain intensity ratings but no difference in pain thresholds after 24 h of fluid restriction. Therefore, the current findings extend these previous results to women by showing that mild hypohydration also increases experimental pain sensitivity in women. The previous studies also did not include pain measures that reflect the affective/emotional experience of pain (i.e., pain tolerance or pain unpleasantness ratings) that may be important for chronic pain, whereas both pain threshold and pain intensity ratings assess the sensory/discriminative aspect of pain (49, 50). Although Bear et al. (8) measured pain tolerance, the nature of the stimulus-response relationship for the cold pressor task\u0097i.e., plateau and gradual decline in the perceived intensity of the pain stimulus (41)\u0097resulted in a large proportion (?2/3) of participants who were able to tolerate the pain until the 4-min cut-off time, thereby precluding meaningful analyses of the results. This issue was not apparent with the ischemic pain test used in the present study, as there was only one instance where the 20-min time limit was reached. Therefore, the current findings further add to the previous data by showing that mild hypohydration also negatively impacts the affective/emotional aspect of pain, as evidenced by the decrease in pain tolerance and increase in pain unpleasantness ratings compared with EUH.\n\nThe exact mechanisms underlying the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration cannot be determined from the current data. However, one potential mechanism through which hypohydration may increase pain sensitivity is thirst perception. Geuter et al. (51) showed that an increase in thirst perception\u0097induced by consumption of salty snacks followed by 5 h of fluid deprivation\u0097led to an increase in pain intensity ratings during noxious heat stimulation, whereas subsequent ad libitum fluid intake, which reduced thirst perception, decreased pain ratings. In another study, stimulation of thirst sensation via hypertonic saline infusion increased pain intensity ratings during noxious pressure stimulation, which were associated with stronger activation of pain-related brain regions; namely, the anterior cingulate cortex and insula (52). Similar findings were reported in the study by Ogino et al. (7). These brain regions were previously shown to be activated and deactivated independently by an increase and decrease in thirst perception, respectively (52\u009654). However, it is not apparent from these data whether the increased pain sensitivity and pain-related brain activity were due to thirst perception per se, physiological hypohydration, or both.\n\nMenstrual Phase and Experimental Pain Sensitivity\nMenstrual phase did not modulate the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration, nor did it independently affect pain sensitivity. The lack of a menstrual phase effect on ischemic pain sensitivity is consistent with the findings of most previous studies that examined ischemic pain responses across the menstrual cycle (18, 55\u009658). In contrast, studies by Fillingim et al. (59) and Pfleeger et al. (60) observed greater pain sensitivity during the luteal compared with follicular phase. However, concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone were not measured in the study by Pfleeger et al. (60), whereas the specific definition of the luteal phase used by Fillingim et al. (59) differed from that in the current study. We examined the ML phase when concentrations of both 17?-estradiol and progesterone are elevated, whereas Fillingim et al. (59) included the late-luteal period in their classification of the luteal phase, during which concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone are declining rapidly and are less stable compared with the ML phase. Given that menstrual phases characterized by fluctuating or unstable 17?-estradiol levels have been associated with increased severity of various chronic pain conditions (14), this may explain why Fillingim et al. (59) observed phase differences in pain sensitivity whereas we did not.\n\nThe equivocal and inconclusive results regarding menstrual phase effects on experimental pain sensitivity are thought to be due, in part, to the lack of proper verification of menstrual phases through blood measurements of 17?-estradiol and progesterone (15, 16), making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relationship between menstrual phase/hormone status and pain sensitivity. Similar to previous observations (22, 23), Sosm was lower in the ML than EF phase (Table 2); however, this phase difference in hydration did not appear to impact any of the ischemic pain measures (Figs. 1\u00963). In this study, we showed that after hydration status was controlled, menstrual phases were properly verified and potential confounders (e.g., dietary and lifestyle factors and dysmenorrhea) were minimized, there was no difference in ischemic pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases. As such, our data suggest that the hormonal fluctuations within the menstrual cycle do not greatly impact pain sensitivity.\n\nInterestingly, although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phase, there was a positive correlation between 17?-estradiol and pain sensitivity, suggesting that women with higher baseline levels of 17?-estradiol may be more sensitive to pain than those with lower 17?-estradiol levels (i.e., between-subject effect). However, given the weak strength of the correlation (r = ?0.32) (48), this finding should be interpreted with caution.\n\nEffects of Acute Water Ingestion\nGiven that thirst perception may be a potential mechanism linking hypohydration and increased pain sensitivity, we hypothesized that acute water ingestion when hypohydrated would reduce pain sensitivity. This would also help to delineate the effects of thirst and hypohydration per se, on pain, since acute water ingestion would be expected to reduce thirst without altering hydration status (38, 61). However, contrary to our hypothesis, ischemic pain tolerance was not affected by ingestion of 5 mL\u00b7kg?1 of water, despite the significant decrease in thirst perception ratings. Meanwhile, ratings of both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness increased, which may appear counterintuitive as participants reported feeling more pain despite being less thirsty. These unexpected findings may be explained by carryover (sensitization) effects from the baseline pain test. A previous study showed that repeated pain stimulation within a single session produced a sensitization effect, whereby pain ratings increased gradually with each repeated stimulation (62). Therefore, this sensitization effect may have masked potential positive effects of acute water ingestion on pain. Future studies that either utilize a longer interval between the repeated pain tests, or perform the postwater ingestion pain test on a separate day, are required to gain further understanding on the relative importance of thirst perception and physiological hypohydration on pain.\n\nConsiderations\nThere are several considerations and limitations of this study that should be noted in addition to those already discussed earlier. First, only healthy, eumenorrheic women were included in this study, which ignores postmenopausal women and oral contraceptive pill users, who have different hormonal profiles compared with eumenorrheic women. Therefore, it is possible that hypohydration may affect pain sensitivity differently in these women compared with eumenorrheic women. Second, blood samples were not obtained after water ingestion to confirm that hydration status was not altered. However, previous data indicate that consuming a moderate volume of water, similar to that in the current study, does not acutely alter hydration status in hypohydrated men (38, 61). In addition, the relatively short interval of 30 min between water ingestion and the subsequent pain test was likely insufficient for hydration status to be altered, because a previous study showed that at least 75 min is required for 300 mL of water to be completely absorbed into the bloodstream (63). Third, as participants could not be blinded to the hydration intervention, the increased pain sensitivity observed during HYPO may have been confounded by nocebo effects (64, 65). Although participants were not aware of the study hypotheses, they were aware of the aims of the study, one of which was to investigate the effects of hypohydration on pain sensitivity. Given the negative connotations of hypohydration or dehydration, it is conceivable that participants would expect hypohydration to increase pain sensitivity, which may have subsequently influenced participants\u0092 actual responses to the ischemic pain test. Fourth, the body mass change values in HYPO may not accurately reflect the fluid losses induced by the 24 h of fluid restriction. Due to the scheduling constraints that included two experimental visits within 3 days per menstrual phase, we were unable to obtain a baseline body mass at the start of the hydration intervention; thus, body mass change in HYPO was calculated using EUH body mass. As the EUH and HYPO trials within each menstrual phase were separated by at least 48 h, it is likely that the values were confounded by factors other than the change in body water content (e.g., urine and fecal losses, food and fluid consumption). Acknowledging this limitation, we obtained other measures of hydration status (i.e., Sosm, USG, copeptin, and thirst ratings) in addition to body mass change for a more accurate assessment of hydrations status. Finally, our sample size may have limited our ability to detect statistically significant menstrual phase effects on pain. As such, the effects of menstrual phase on pain require further investigation. Our study could provide a reference for future studies with a similar design to base their sample size calculations on. Nevertheless, large effect sizes (?2p\n = 0.37\u00960.55) were obtained for the main effect of hypohydration on pain, with an observed power of 0.7\u00960.9, which suggests a low probability of false negatives.\n\nPerspectives and Significance\nOur data indicate that hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women and this effect may not be reversed immediately by water ingestion. Whereas, menstrual phase (EF vs. ML) does not appear to affect pain sensitivity. These findings suggest that insufficient water intake throughout the day may exacerbate pain perception in healthy women. Given the high prevalence of hypohydration among the general population (25), future studies should investigate whether hypohydration may worsen chronic pain conditions, and the potential efficacy of maintaining adequate hydration in alleviating pain symptoms. This may be especially important for older adults, who are more likely to be hypohydrated and experience chronic pain (25, 66). For human pain researchers, controlling or measuring hydration status of participants may be important to minimize confound, as clinically and physiologically relevant tests such as the cold pressor are affected (67). Although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases after controlling for hydration status, more high-quality research is required to accurately determine whether menstrual phase does or does not affect pain sensitivity. Therefore, until a consensus on the topic has been reached, our data do not discount the need for future pain researchers to verify menstrual phase.\n\n", "folder": "text/2023-06-20 full", "system_role": "You are a helpful assistant.", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 1000, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613", "qna": {"date": "2023-06-20 1431", "folder": "text/2023-06-20 full", "article_title": "Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women", "system_role": "You are a helpful assistant.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613", "text": "Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women\n\nINTRODUCTION\nPain is recognized as a public health problem (1). Chronic pain [i.e., pain that persists for ?3 mo (2)] in particular, affects ?20% of the global population (3, 4), with negative consequences to the individual, society, healthcare, and the economy. In the United States, the annual cost of chronic pain is estimated to be $635 million\u0097more than that of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes combined (5). However, chronic pain treatment has proven difficult due to the complex and multifactorial nature of pain (6). In a survey conducted across several European countries, 40% of chronic pain sufferers reported feeling dissatisfied with the effectiveness of their pain treatment(s) (4). Hence, more research on the mechanisms and factors contributing to a person\u0092s pain experience is needed. Given the various complexities of studying chronic pain (e.g., ethical, logistical, and medical considerations), such research is usually performed by administering various acute experimental pain stimuli to healthy individuals.\n\nRecent studies have shown that hypohydration can increase experimental pain sensitivity (7, 8). Mild hypohydration of <1% body mass loss, induced by prior fasting and exercise, was found to decrease pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) during a cold pressor task in men, compared with when they were rehydrated (7). These findings were supported in a later study, where subjective ratings of cold pressor pain in men were higher after 24 h of fluid restriction (1.4% body mass loss) than in the euhydrated condition (8). Similarly, a field study showed that hypohydrated cyclists perceived more intense pain in their leg muscles during an ultra-endurance race, compared with the euhydrated cyclists (9). However, these studies were primarily performed in men and the effects of hypohydration on pain in women have not been formally investigated.\n\nSeveral chronic pain conditions are more prevalent among women than men (10). Women also tend to display greater sensitivity to various experimental pain stimuli (11). Furthermore, pain perception in women may be influenced by hormonal fluctuations (primarily 17?-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle (12, 13). It is generally agreed that the severity of pain symptoms in several chronic pain conditions varies across the menstrual cycle (13, 14); however, whether the menstrual phase affects experimental pain sensitivity in healthy, pain-free women is still contestable (15, 16). The lack of accurate verification of menstrual phases and presence of various potential confounders (e.g., dysmenorrhea, dietary, and lifestyle factors) in many studies could explain the inconsistent findings (15). Some studies have attempted to address these issues (e.g., see Refs. 17 and 18), but such studies are scant and did not appear to impose a progesterone threshold to ensure only ovulatory cycles were included (19). Notably, none of the previous studies measured hydration status of participants at the time of testing, which may be influenced by menstrual phase (20, 21).\n\nThe ovarian hormones affect body fluid regulatory mechanisms (22), with potential implications for hydration status (20, 21). The mid-luteal phase (high 17?-estradiol and progesterone) is associated with an earlier release of arginine vasopressin (AVP)\u0097a fluid-regulatory hormone that increases renal water retention\u0097and thirst during exercise-induced dehydration or hypertonic saline infusion, compared with the early follicular phase (low 17?-estradiol and progesterone) (23, 24). This may potentially reduce the severity of dehydration for a given hydration challenge in the mid-luteal phase (20, 21). In the context of pain, this may suggest: 1) differences in the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration in the early follicular compared with mid-luteal phase, 2) potential variability in hydration status across the menstrual cycle may have confounded previous research on effects of the menstrual phase and experimental pain sensitivity, and 3) hypohydration may reduce the efficacy of pain treatments in women (21).\n\nImportantly, mild hypohydration appears to be common among women, with data from the United States showing approximately half of the 7,855 surveyed women meeting the hypohydration criterion (plasma tonicity > 295 mmol\u00b7L?1) (25). Therefore, the current study investigated the effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in women. We also examined whether the negative consequences of hypohydration on pain could be remedied by acute water ingestion. We hypothesized that 1) hypohydration would increase experimental pain sensitivity in women, 2) the magnitude of this increase in pain sensitivity would differ between the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases, and 3) acute water ingestion would reverse the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration.\n\nMETHODS\nEthical Approval\nThe study was approved by the Massey University Human Ethics Committee: Southern A (18/66). The study conformed to the requirements of the US Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (45 CFR, Part 46), and the standards set by the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki, except for registration in a database. All participants provided written, informed consent before all trials. Researchers were not blinded to the experimental conditions and analyses.\n\nParticipants\nTwenty-three healthy, eumenorrheic women initially volunteered for this study. As this is the first study, to our knowledge, that has investigated the effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase in combination, there was no reference study to base our sample size calculations on. As such, sample size was estimated from two previous studies; one on hypohydration and pain (? = 0.79 and effect size = 0.53) (8) and the other on a meta-analysis on menstrual phase effects on pain (effect size = 0.5 for ischemic pain, ? = 0.80) (12), which yielded required sample sizes of n = 17 and n = 27, respectively at an ? = 0.05. Therefore, we aimed for 17 > n < 27 and estimated the required number of participants for sufficient power to be n = 22.\n\nSix participants did not proceed with the experimental trials due to scheduling difficulties; thus, 17 women completed all experimental trials [means (SD): age, 28 (8) yr; height, 1.63 (0.07) m; body mass, 65.0 (10.8) kg]. Participants reported having regular menstrual cycles (i.e., 21\u009635 days) at the time of recruitment and had not used hormonal contraceptives within the past 6 mo. All participants were nonsmokers, had no pre-existing or history of medical, psychiatric, pain-related, or menstrual-related disorders (e.g., dysmenorrhea, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and premenstrual syndrome), and were not taking any medications. Taking into consideration these inclusion/exclusion criteria, women aged > 18 < 50 yr were recruited. All participants, except for one, were recreationally physically active, engaging in at least 150 min of structured exercise per week.\n\nExperimental Overview\nParticipants attended the laboratory on six occasions: two familiarization sessions, followed by four experimental trials. The four experimental trials were a full crossover of menstrual phase (EF and ML) and hydration status [euhydrated (EUH) and hypohydrated (HYPO)] and were performed over one or two menstrual cycles. The order of the experimental trials was randomized and counterbalanced, but the order of EUH and HYPO for each participant was maintained in the different menstrual phases. The experimental trials for each participant began at the same time of day (\u00b11 h) to minimize diurnal variation in pain sensitivity (26) and ovarian hormone concentrations (27). All trials were separated by at least 48 h and were performed under standard environmental conditions (22\u00b0C, 50% relative humidity, room illuminance of 600 lx).\n\nFamiliarization\nBefore the experimental trials, participants were familiarized with the ischemic pain test (see Ischemic Pain Test) on two separate occasions to minimize potential learning and anxiety effects. The first familiarization session also included measurement of participants\u0092 height and body mass (for calculation of fluid volume), and assessment of their maximal handgrip strength (see Maximal Handgrip Strength Assessment) to determine the absolute intensity for the submaximal contractions during the ischemic pain test. The number of familiarization sessions was determined from preliminary assessment of the time course of the learning effects, where pain outcome measures appeared to plateau after two sessions.\n\nMaximal Handgrip Strength Assessment\nUsing their nondominant hand, participants performed three maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) with a handgrip dynamometer (MLT003 Grip Force Transducer, ADInstruments Inc., CO) (28). Participants were asked to squeeze the dynamometer maximally for 5 s during each MVC, separated by 1 min of rest. Force output from the dynamometer was recorded (PowerLab, ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand) and displayed in real-time (LabChart Pro, ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand). Maximal handgrip strength was determined by calculating the mean of the peak values for the three MVCs. This assessment was only conducted once during the first familiarization session, rather than at the start of each experimental trial, to prevent potential effects of the MVCs on subsequent pain sensitivity (28). Furthermore, maximal handgrip strength does not appear to be affected by menstrual phase (19, 29) or hypohydration (30, 31).\n\nDietary and Lifestyle Control\nParticipants refrained from pain-relieving medications, alcohol, and strenuous exercise at least 12 h before the start of each experimental trial. Participants also maintained their habitual caffeine intake over this 24-h period to minimize confounding effects of caffeine on pain sensitivity (32) and psychological variables (33, 34). To prevent caffeine withdrawal during the hypohydrated trials, participants who normally consumed caffeinated beverages were given a caffeine tablet (No-Doz Awakeners, Novartis Consumer Health, Inc.) to take in place of the beverages. Participants recorded their diet, physical activity, and time to bed and wake (i.e., sleep duration) during the 24-h period before their first trial and were asked to replicate these for subsequent trials. Participants completed a dietary and lifestyle record sheet at the start of each trial to assess adherence to these instructions.\n\nMenstrual Cycle Phase and Hydration Intervention\nParticipants were tested during the EF and ML phases of their menstrual cycle to maximize the phase difference in ovarian hormone concentrations. The EF trials took place on days 4 (1) and 6 (2) and the ML trials on days 20 (2) and 22 (2), with day 1 representing start of menses and assuming a conventional 28-day menstrual cycle. Testing was scheduled using the three-step method (35) whereby self-reported menses onset and urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) testing (EasyCheck Ovulation Test, Phoenix Medcare, Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand) prospectively identified EF and ML, whereas measurement of serum 17?-estradiol and progesterone retrospectively confirmed ML. The EF phase was further verified by 17?-estradiol concentrations that were lower than in ML. Participants started daily LH testing 16 days before the end of a typical cycle until a positive LH test result was obtained (confirmed visually by the researchers), with ML trials then scheduled six to ten days after the positive LH test. To ensure ovulation had occurred and to minimize the likelihood of including anovulatory or luteal phase-deficient cycles, participants with progesterone < 5 ng\u00b7mL?1 were excluded from the final analyses (19, 36).\n\nTwenty-four hours before each trial, participants were instructed to either restrict fluid intake and avoid consumption of high-water content foods (>50%, e.g., soups, vegetables, and fruits) (HYPO), or to drink ad libitum (EUH). Participants recorded their food and fluid intake over this 24-h period retrospectively at the start of each trial (see Dietary and Lifestyle Control and Experimental Protocol).\n\nExperimental Protocol\nUpon the participants\u0092 arrival at the laboratory, a blood sample was obtained from the antecubital vein of the dominant arm via venepuncture. Participants then provided a urine sample and had their body mass measured. Urine specific gravity (USG) was measured immediately to confirm euhydration (USG < 1.020) or hypohydration (USG ? 1.020) (37). Participants then completed the dietary and lifestyle record sheet, Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (EUH only; see Measurements) and thirst ratings, followed by the ischemic pain test.\n\nImmediately after the pain test, participants ingested a glass of water (5 mL\u00b7kg?1 of body mass measured during the first familiarization) and finished it within 5 min. This volume of water was previously shown to produce an immediate decrease in thirst perception in hypohydrated men (38). A 30-min break followed, during which participants remained in the laboratory and performed their activity of choice (e.g., reading and watching videos) that was consistent for all trials. After the break, participants repeated the thirst ratings and ischemic pain test. The duration of the break was determined based on previous data that examined the reliability of pressure pain measurements taken before and after 30 min of rest (39). Pain thresholds at both time points were not different; however, pain ratings decreased after the 30-min break in women, but not in men. Although this suggests that more than 30 min may be required to ameliorate carryover effects, especially in women, we decided on 30 min to prevent boredom and restlessness since participants had to remain in the laboratory during this period.\n\nIschemic Pain Test\nThe ischemic pain test consisted of the Submaximal Effort Tourniquet Procedure (40). This experimental pain stimulus was chosen as it is more clinically relevant than other pain stimuli (e.g., noxious heat, mechanical pressure, and electrical stimulation) (41). A pneumatic cuff was positioned on the participant\u0092s nondominant arm, just above the elbow joint. The participant\u0092s arm was passively raised to a vertical position for 30 s to promote venous drainage. The pneumatic cuff was then inflated to 250 mmHg and a stopwatch was started. The participant\u0092s arm was immediately lowered to a horizontal position on the table, such that the forearm rests on the table with the elbow joint at a 90\u00b0 angle. To promote forearm ischemia, participants performed 25 handgrip exercises at 30% of their predetermined maximum handgrip strength (see Familiarization). Each contraction was sustained for 2 s and followed by 2 s of rest. Auditory signals indicated the start and end of each contraction. Participants received continuous visual feedback of their force output and the target force on a laptop screen.\n\nUpon completion of the handgrip exercises, the cuff remained inflated on the participant\u0092s arm and participants watched a nature documentary to standardize their attention throughout the remainder of the pain test. The volume of the video was maintained at 30% for all trials. One minute after the end of the handgrip exercises, participants rated their pain intensity and unpleasantness on a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) (42). Participants were asked to indicate verbally when they were no longer able or willing to endure the pain (pain tolerance). The stopwatch was then stopped; just before the cuff was deflated, participants rated their pain intensity and unpleasantness again, to verify that they had reached pain tolerance. Unknown to participants, a maximum time limit of 20 min was enforced for the pain test.\n\nMeasurements\nAnthropometric.\nParticipants\u0092 height and body mass were measured using a stadiometer (Seca, Hamburg, Germany; accurate to 0.1 cm) and electronic scale (Model X3M, HIWEIGH Technologies Limited, Shanghai, China; accurate to 10 g), respectively.\n\nOvarian hormone concentrations.\nVenous blood was collected into two 10 mL vacutainer tubes (Becton-Dickson, Oxford, UK). One tube contained clot activator for analysis of serum osmolality (Sosm), 17?-estradiol, and progesterone concentrations, whereas the other tube contained K3EDTA for analysis of plasma copeptin. The tube containing clot activator was inverted gently and left to clot for a minimum of 30 min at room temperature. The whole blood in both tubes was then centrifuged (Centrifuge 5804 R, Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) at 4\u00b0C and 260 g for 15 min to separate serum and plasma from whole blood. Aliquots of serum and plasma were then separated into three Eppendorf tubes (Genuine Axygen Quality) each and stored at ?80\u00b0C for further analysis. Commercially available enzyme-linked immune assays were used to measure concentrations of 17?-estradiol (Demeditec Diagnostics, Kiel, Germany) and progesterone (IBL International, Hamburg, Germany) in serum samples, with a sensitivity of 6.2 pg\u00b7mL?1 and 0.045 ng\u00b7mL?1, respectively, and an intra-assay variation of <6% and <7%, respectively. The ratio of progesterone to 17?-estradiol (P4:E2 ratio) was then calculated (43).\n\nHydration status.\nHydration status was assessed by measurement of Sosm, plasma copeptin concentrations, USG, ratings of thirst perception, and percent body mass change. Serum osmolality was measured via freezing-point depression (Digimatic osmometer Model 3D2, Advanced Instruments, Inc., Norwood, MA). Measurements were made in duplicate and averaged. If the two measurements differed by more than 5%, a third measurement was taken and the average of the two closest values was calculated. Plasma copeptin concentrations, a surrogate marker for AVP (44, 45), were measured with an automated immunofluorescent Copeptin proAVP KRYPTOR assay (B\u00b7R\u00b7A\u00b7H\u00b7M\u00b7S KRYPTOR compact PLUS analyzer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Henningsdorf, Germany), with a sensitivity of 1.08 pmol\u00b7L?1. Urine specific gravity was measured using a handheld clinical refractometer (Clinical Refractometer MASTER-SUR/NM, Atago Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Thirst perception was measured using pen and paper with a 10-cm VAS (46). Percent body mass change in HYPO was calculated from the EUH body mass within the same menstrual phase.\n\nPsychological variables.\nDepressive symptomatology was assessed using the CES-D (47). Given the 1-wk response timeframe of the CES-D, it was only administered once in each menstrual phase during the EUH trial.\n\nStatistical Analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software for Windows (IBM SPSS Statistics 20, NY). Descriptive values are reported as means (SD), unless otherwise stated. Data were assessed to ensure they were normally distributed and for sphericity, with no corrections needed. Data for Sosm, plasma copeptin, USG, body mass, 17?-estradiol, progesterone, and the P4:E2 ratio were assessed using a two-way (Phase \u00d7 Hydration) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). For thirst ratings, pain tolerance and pain intensity, and unpleasantness ratings, the data were analyzed by three-way (Phase \u00d7 Hydration \u00d7 Water) repeated-measures ANOVA. When main or interaction effects occurred for the two- or three-way ANOVA, post hoc pair-wise analyses were conducted using paired-samples t tests with Bonferroni correction, where appropriate. Data for CES-D and percent body mass change were analyzed using a paired-samples t test to compare means between menstrual phases. Bivariate Pearson\u0092s correlations were performed to examine the direction and strength of relationships between the main independent (i.e., hydration markers and ovarian hormone concentrations) and dependent (i.e., ischemic pain measures) variables measured at baseline (i.e., before water ingestion). All pairwise data were included in the correlation analyses to maximize statistical power. Effect sizes are reported as partial eta-squared (?2p\n) with demarcations of small (<0.06), medium (>0.06 and <0.14), and large (>0.14) effects, respectively (48). An a priori alpha of ? = 0.05 was used to demarcate statistically significant effects.\n\nRESULTS\nFollowing analysis of ovarian hormone concentrations, three participants did not meet the progesterone threshold of >5 ng\u00b7mL?1 and were excluded from subsequent analyses. Therefore, the following results are reported for the remaining 14 participants.\n\nSelf-Reported Sleep Duration and Depressive Symptomatology\nMean sleep duration across trials was 7.4 (1.6) h, which was not different between hydration conditions or menstrual phases (all P ? 0.15, ?2p\n ? 0.15). Incomplete data were collected for CES-D scores (n = 13). CES-D scores were not different between menstrual phases [EF: 10 (7) vs. ML: 12 (6); P = 0.55, ?2p\n?=?0.03].\n\nOvarian Hormone Concentrations\nBecause of the difficulty in obtaining blood samples in one or more trials for three participants, incomplete data were obtained for serum 17?-estradiol and progesterone concentrations (n = 11 each). Both progesterone [by 25.8 (25.9) vs. 0.5 (0.2) ng\u00b7mL?1; P = 0.009, ?2p\n?=?0.51] and 17?-estradiol [by 106 (58) vs. 52 (27) pg\u00b7mL?1; P = 0.001, ?2p\n?=?0.66] concentrations were higher in the ML compared with EF phase but were not dependent on hydration status (Phase \u00d7 Hydration: all P ? 0.46; ?2p\n ? 0.06) (Table 1). Accordingly, the P4:E2 ratio was also higher in the ML compared with EF phase (P = 0.005, ?2p\n?=?0.57) independent of hydration status (Phase \u00d7 Hydration: P = 0.78; ?2p\n?=?0.01). Progesterone, 17?-estradiol, and the P4:E2 ratio were all unaffected by hydration status (all P ? 0.46, ?2p\n ? 0.06).\n\nHydration Status\nBiochemical markers of hydration status obtained at baseline (i.e., before water ingestion) indicate that 24 h of fluid restriction was successful in eliciting mild dehydration (Table 2). Absolute body mass was lower in HYPO than in EUH (P = 0.006, ?2p\n?=?0.45) but this was not dependent on menstrual phase (Phase \u00d7 hydration: P = 0.31, ?2p\n?=?0.08). Therefore, average percent change in body mass from EUH to HYPO was 0.9% (1.3).\n\nBecause of the difficulty in obtaining blood samples, incomplete data were collected for Sosm (n = 10) and plasma copeptin (n = 9). Sosm was higher during HYPO than EUH (P = 0.001, ?2p\n?=?0.72) and was higher in EF than in ML (P = 0.03, ?2p\n?=?0.43), but these effects were not dependent on menstrual phase or hydration status, respectively (Phase \u00d7 Hydration: P = 0.22, ?2p\n?=?0.17). Both plasma copeptin (P = 0.04, ?2p\n?=?0.44) and USG (P < 0.001, ?2p\n?=?0.84) were also higher in HYPO than in EUH, but these were not dependent on menstrual phase (Phase \u00d7 hydration: both P ? 0.40, ?2p\n ? 0.09). In accordance with the significantly higher values of these biochemical markers, baseline thirst ratings were also higher during HYPO than in EUH (P < 0.001; ?2p\n?=?0.89), independent of menstrual phase (Phase \u00d7 Hydration: P = 0.67, ?2p\n?=?0.02).\n\nThirst Perception Ratings\nIncomplete data were collected for thirst perception ratings (n = 13). Overall, thirst was higher during HYPO than EUH [by 3.2 (1.2) cm; P < 0.001, ?2p\n?=?0.89] and was higher in ML than in EF [by 0.4 (0.6) cm; P = 0.04, ?2p\n?=?0.30], but these effects were not dependent on menstrual phase or hydration status, respectively (Phase \u00d7 hydration: P = 0.67, ?2p\n?=?0.02). Thirst ratings decreased after water ingestion (from baseline) by a larger extent during HYPO than in EUH [? 4.0 (2.3) vs. ? 0.6 (1.4) cm; Hydration \u00d7 Water: P < 0.001, ?2p\n?=?0.65], independent of menstrual phase (Phase \u00d7 Hydration \u00d7 Water: P = 0.47, ?\n2\np\n?=?0.05).\nIschemic Pain Tolerance\nOne participant was able to tolerate the ischemic pain for the maximum time limit of 20 min (1,200 s) in one trial (EUH trial in the ML phase) (Fig. 1). Her pain tolerance in this trial was therefore recorded as 1,200 s. Pain tolerance was lower during HYPO than in EUH [by 34 (46) s; P = 0.02, ?2p\n?=?0.37), independent of menstrual phase (Phase \u00d7 Hydration: P = 0.15, ?2p\n?=?0.15) or acute water ingestion (Hydration \u00d7 Water: P = 0.92; ?2p\n?=?0.001). Pain tolerance was unaffected by menstrual phase or acute water ingestion (both P ? 0.43, ?2p\n ? 0.05).\n\nIschemic Pain Intensity and Unpleasantness Ratings\nIncomplete data were collected for pain intensity (Fig. 2) and unpleasantness (Fig. 3) at 1 min after handgrip exercise (n = 12 each) because two participants had terminated the pain test before this time point. Both pain intensity [6.6 (1.3) vs. 5.9 (1.4) cm; P = 0.004, ?2p\n?=?0.55)] and pain unpleasantness [7.1 (1.3) vs. 6.4 (1.5) cm; P = 0.02, ?2p\n?=?0.40] ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise were higher during HYPO than in EUH, independent of menstrual phase (Phase \u00d7 Hydration: both P ? 0.15, ?2p\n ? 0.18). Both pain intensity (P = 0.004, ?2p\n?=?0.54) and pain unpleasantness (P = 0.04, ?2p\n?=?0.34) ratings increased after water ingestion (from baseline), independently of hydration status (Hydration \u00d7 Water: both P ? 0.50, ?2p\n ? 0.04) or menstrual phase (Phase \u00d7 Water: both P ? 0.53, ?2p\n ? 0.04).\n\nAt pain tolerance, however, both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness ratings were not different between hydration conditions or menstrual phases (all P ? 0.13, ?2p\n ? 0.17). After water ingestion, pain intensity ratings increased by 3.4 (0.6) cm from baseline (P = 0.04, ?2p\n?=?0.29) but pain unpleasantness was unaffected [+0.2 (4.6) cm; P = 0.10, ?2p\n?=?0.20], independent of hydration status (Hydration \u00d7 Water: both P ? 0.11, ?2p\n ? 0.19) or menstrual phase (Phase \u00d7 Water: both P ? 0.55, ?2p\n ? 0.03).\n\nCorrelations\nSerum concentrations of 17?-estradiol were negatively correlated with pain tolerance (r = ?0.31, P = 0.02) and positively correlated with pain unpleasantness ratings (r = 0.34, P = 0.02), but were not significantly associated with pain intensity ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (r = 0.23, P = 0.13). However, it should be noted that the strength of the significant correlations observed was weak (48) and therefore should be interpreted with caution. Neither progesterone nor the P4:E2 ratio was significantly associated with any of the ischemic pain measures (all r ? ?0.20, P ? 0.17). Similarly, no significant correlations were found between any of the hydration variables and ischemic pain measures (all r ? 0.20 and P ? 0.17).\n\nDISCUSSION\nThis study examined the independent and combined effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in healthy eumenorrheic women, and the potential efficacy of acute water ingestion as a remedy to the deleterious impact of hypohydration. The main findings were that: 1) mild hypohydration increased pain sensitivity, 2) menstrual phase did not affect pain sensitivity, nor did it influence the effect of hypohydration on pain, and 3) acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity.\n\nHypohydration and Pain in Women\nIndependent of menstrual phase, mild hypohydration following 24 h of fluid restriction reduced pain tolerance (?8%) and increased pain intensity (+13%) and pain unpleasantness (+12%) ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (hereafter referred to as pain ratings) during ischemic pain stimulation, when compared with euhydration. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies that showed negative effects of mild hypohydration on experimental pain sensitivity in men (7, 8). Ogino et al. (7) observed a decrease in pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) following a combination of exercise-induced dehydration and fluid restriction, whereas Bear et al. (8) found an increase in pain intensity ratings but no difference in pain thresholds after 24 h of fluid restriction. Therefore, the current findings extend these previous results to women by showing that mild hypohydration also increases experimental pain sensitivity in women. The previous studies also did not include pain measures that reflect the affective/emotional experience of pain (i.e., pain tolerance or pain unpleasantness ratings) that may be important for chronic pain, whereas both pain threshold and pain intensity ratings assess the sensory/discriminative aspect of pain (49, 50). Although Bear et al. (8) measured pain tolerance, the nature of the stimulus-response relationship for the cold pressor task\u0097i.e., plateau and gradual decline in the perceived intensity of the pain stimulus (41)\u0097resulted in a large proportion (?2/3) of participants who were able to tolerate the pain until the 4-min cut-off time, thereby precluding meaningful analyses of the results. This issue was not apparent with the ischemic pain test used in the present study, as there was only one instance where the 20-min time limit was reached. Therefore, the current findings further add to the previous data by showing that mild hypohydration also negatively impacts the affective/emotional aspect of pain, as evidenced by the decrease in pain tolerance and increase in pain unpleasantness ratings compared with EUH.\n\nThe exact mechanisms underlying the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration cannot be determined from the current data. However, one potential mechanism through which hypohydration may increase pain sensitivity is thirst perception. Geuter et al. (51) showed that an increase in thirst perception\u0097induced by consumption of salty snacks followed by 5 h of fluid deprivation\u0097led to an increase in pain intensity ratings during noxious heat stimulation, whereas subsequent ad libitum fluid intake, which reduced thirst perception, decreased pain ratings. In another study, stimulation of thirst sensation via hypertonic saline infusion increased pain intensity ratings during noxious pressure stimulation, which were associated with stronger activation of pain-related brain regions; namely, the anterior cingulate cortex and insula (52). Similar findings were reported in the study by Ogino et al. (7). These brain regions were previously shown to be activated and deactivated independently by an increase and decrease in thirst perception, respectively (52\u009654). However, it is not apparent from these data whether the increased pain sensitivity and pain-related brain activity were due to thirst perception per se, physiological hypohydration, or both.\n\nMenstrual Phase and Experimental Pain Sensitivity\nMenstrual phase did not modulate the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration, nor did it independently affect pain sensitivity. The lack of a menstrual phase effect on ischemic pain sensitivity is consistent with the findings of most previous studies that examined ischemic pain responses across the menstrual cycle (18, 55\u009658). In contrast, studies by Fillingim et al. (59) and Pfleeger et al. (60) observed greater pain sensitivity during the luteal compared with follicular phase. However, concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone were not measured in the study by Pfleeger et al. (60), whereas the specific definition of the luteal phase used by Fillingim et al. (59) differed from that in the current study. We examined the ML phase when concentrations of both 17?-estradiol and progesterone are elevated, whereas Fillingim et al. (59) included the late-luteal period in their classification of the luteal phase, during which concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone are declining rapidly and are less stable compared with the ML phase. Given that menstrual phases characterized by fluctuating or unstable 17?-estradiol levels have been associated with increased severity of various chronic pain conditions (14), this may explain why Fillingim et al. (59) observed phase differences in pain sensitivity whereas we did not.\n\nThe equivocal and inconclusive results regarding menstrual phase effects on experimental pain sensitivity are thought to be due, in part, to the lack of proper verification of menstrual phases through blood measurements of 17?-estradiol and progesterone (15, 16), making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relationship between menstrual phase/hormone status and pain sensitivity. Similar to previous observations (22, 23), Sosm was lower in the ML than EF phase (Table 2); however, this phase difference in hydration did not appear to impact any of the ischemic pain measures (Figs. 1\u00963). In this study, we showed that after hydration status was controlled, menstrual phases were properly verified and potential confounders (e.g., dietary and lifestyle factors and dysmenorrhea) were minimized, there was no difference in ischemic pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases. As such, our data suggest that the hormonal fluctuations within the menstrual cycle do not greatly impact pain sensitivity.\n\nInterestingly, although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phase, there was a positive correlation between 17?-estradiol and pain sensitivity, suggesting that women with higher baseline levels of 17?-estradiol may be more sensitive to pain than those with lower 17?-estradiol levels (i.e., between-subject effect). However, given the weak strength of the correlation (r = ?0.32) (48), this finding should be interpreted with caution.\n\nEffects of Acute Water Ingestion\nGiven that thirst perception may be a potential mechanism linking hypohydration and increased pain sensitivity, we hypothesized that acute water ingestion when hypohydrated would reduce pain sensitivity. This would also help to delineate the effects of thirst and hypohydration per se, on pain, since acute water ingestion would be expected to reduce thirst without altering hydration status (38, 61). However, contrary to our hypothesis, ischemic pain tolerance was not affected by ingestion of 5 mL\u00b7kg?1 of water, despite the significant decrease in thirst perception ratings. Meanwhile, ratings of both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness increased, which may appear counterintuitive as participants reported feeling more pain despite being less thirsty. These unexpected findings may be explained by carryover (sensitization) effects from the baseline pain test. A previous study showed that repeated pain stimulation within a single session produced a sensitization effect, whereby pain ratings increased gradually with each repeated stimulation (62). Therefore, this sensitization effect may have masked potential positive effects of acute water ingestion on pain. Future studies that either utilize a longer interval between the repeated pain tests, or perform the postwater ingestion pain test on a separate day, are required to gain further understanding on the relative importance of thirst perception and physiological hypohydration on pain.\n\nConsiderations\nThere are several considerations and limitations of this study that should be noted in addition to those already discussed earlier. First, only healthy, eumenorrheic women were included in this study, which ignores postmenopausal women and oral contraceptive pill users, who have different hormonal profiles compared with eumenorrheic women. Therefore, it is possible that hypohydration may affect pain sensitivity differently in these women compared with eumenorrheic women. Second, blood samples were not obtained after water ingestion to confirm that hydration status was not altered. However, previous data indicate that consuming a moderate volume of water, similar to that in the current study, does not acutely alter hydration status in hypohydrated men (38, 61). In addition, the relatively short interval of 30 min between water ingestion and the subsequent pain test was likely insufficient for hydration status to be altered, because a previous study showed that at least 75 min is required for 300 mL of water to be completely absorbed into the bloodstream (63). Third, as participants could not be blinded to the hydration intervention, the increased pain sensitivity observed during HYPO may have been confounded by nocebo effects (64, 65). Although participants were not aware of the study hypotheses, they were aware of the aims of the study, one of which was to investigate the effects of hypohydration on pain sensitivity. Given the negative connotations of hypohydration or dehydration, it is conceivable that participants would expect hypohydration to increase pain sensitivity, which may have subsequently influenced participants\u0092 actual responses to the ischemic pain test. Fourth, the body mass change values in HYPO may not accurately reflect the fluid losses induced by the 24 h of fluid restriction. Due to the scheduling constraints that included two experimental visits within 3 days per menstrual phase, we were unable to obtain a baseline body mass at the start of the hydration intervention; thus, body mass change in HYPO was calculated using EUH body mass. As the EUH and HYPO trials within each menstrual phase were separated by at least 48 h, it is likely that the values were confounded by factors other than the change in body water content (e.g., urine and fecal losses, food and fluid consumption). Acknowledging this limitation, we obtained other measures of hydration status (i.e., Sosm, USG, copeptin, and thirst ratings) in addition to body mass change for a more accurate assessment of hydrations status. Finally, our sample size may have limited our ability to detect statistically significant menstrual phase effects on pain. As such, the effects of menstrual phase on pain require further investigation. Our study could provide a reference for future studies with a similar design to base their sample size calculations on. Nevertheless, large effect sizes (?2p\n = 0.37\u00960.55) were obtained for the main effect of hypohydration on pain, with an observed power of 0.7\u00960.9, which suggests a low probability of false negatives.\n\nPerspectives and Significance\nOur data indicate that hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women and this effect may not be reversed immediately by water ingestion. Whereas, menstrual phase (EF vs. ML) does not appear to affect pain sensitivity. These findings suggest that insufficient water intake throughout the day may exacerbate pain perception in healthy women. Given the high prevalence of hypohydration among the general population (25), future studies should investigate whether hypohydration may worsen chronic pain conditions, and the potential efficacy of maintaining adequate hydration in alleviating pain symptoms. This may be especially important for older adults, who are more likely to be hypohydrated and experience chronic pain (25, 66). For human pain researchers, controlling or measuring hydration status of participants may be important to minimize confound, as clinically and physiologically relevant tests such as the cold pressor are affected (67). Although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases after controlling for hydration status, more high-quality research is required to accurately determine whether menstrual phase does or does not affect pain sensitivity. Therefore, until a consensus on the topic has been reached, our data do not discount the need for future pain researchers to verify menstrual phase.\n\n", "prep step": "Summarize the text for a LinkedIn post.", "summarization task": "In the summary, cover the following information:     \n- Identify the key points and statistics from this text that would make interesting or helpful health content.     \n- If available, include the effect sizes found in the research.

Higher weight individuals are stigmatized across many contexts, including healthcare, employment and income, education, media, and interpersonal relationships [1]. Repeated exposure to weight stigma may be consequential as considerable evidence suggests that weight stigma undermines physical health even when controlling for body mass index (BMI), which addresses the potential confound that higher adiposity begets both weight stigma and poorer health. For instance, weight discrimination predicts physiological dysregulation involving a suite of outcomes (e.g., blood pressure; inflammation; cholesterol) [2], and even mortality [3]. These findings indicate a vulnerable health profile of individuals stigmatized for their weight, particularly those with overweight or obesity. Yet, it remains unclear how weight stigma may also impact several health behaviors, which is one likely pathway through which weight stigma \u0093gets under the skin\u0094 to generate poorer health outcomes. Scholars have previously suggested that weight stigma may play a positive role in motivating individuals to engage in health behaviors that could lead to weight loss\u0097presumably as a way to improve health [4]. This contention, however, is not empirically supported. Rather, stigmatizing individuals for their weight is consistently associated with negative consequences [5]. Although health behaviors are modifiable ways to improve health across the weight spectrum, individuals who experience weight stigma may cope with this mistreatment by engaging in health compromising behaviors. For instance, a person who has been stigmatized because of their size may be less likely to go to the gym, as this is an environment that puts them at risk for further stigmatization. Individuals encountering weight stigma may also eat to comfort their distress [6]. Although previous research has shown that, independent of BMI, weight stigma is associated with increased maladaptive eating behaviors and decreased motivation to exercise [7], less is known about other common health behaviors such as alcohol use and sleep. Thus, the present study examined the relationship between weight stigma and several modifiable health behaviors in a large U.S. sample. In the next section, the existing literature on weight stigma is outlined across four different health behaviors: eating behavior, physical activity, alcohol use, and sleep. Where available, findings pertaining to gender differences in these areas of research are summarized. As will become evident below, there are notable gaps in this literature that we address in the present study. \n\nWEIGHT STIGMA AND EATING BEHAVIOR \n\nEating a healthy diet helps prevent noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer [8]. However, weight stigma may pose one barrier to healthy eating behavior. In laboratory settings, stigmatizing individuals with higher weight (or individuals who perceived themselves as such) led to short-term increases in eating of highfat, -sugar, and -calorie foods [9]. This eating is theorized to be a form of comfort eating due to the stress of weight stigma [6] and at least one study has found an association between weight stigma and emotional eating [10]. Weight stigma is also associated with unhealthy weight control behaviors and disordered eating such as binge eating [11]. Additionally, there is some longitudinal evidence that shows the potential long-term effects of weight stigma on adolescents\u0092 eating and weight control practices. For example, one study found that adolescent girls who were labeled \u0093too fat\u0094 showed increased bulimic and unhealthy weight control behaviors (e.g., using diet pills) 5 years later [12]. \n\nWEIGHT STIGMA AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY \n\nEngaging in regular physical activity is associated with numerous health benefits, including lower risk for premature all-cause mortality, hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [13]. For higher weight individuals, weight stigma may be a barrier to engage in physical activity, though the findings are mixed. Some studies have shown that weight stigma is associated with greater exercise avoidance [14] and lower exercise selfefficacy and intentions [15]. One study found that weight bias internalization was associated with lower levels of exercise and self-efficacy, while experienced weight stigma predicted higher levels of exercise [16]. Yet other research found a positive relationship between weight discrimination and greater sedentary behavior among middle-aged and older adults [17]. \n\nWEIGHT STIGMA AND ALCOHOL USE \n\nAlcohol consumption, particularly heavy drinking, has been associated with heart disease, stroke, and some cancers [18]. There is a large body of research showing that perceived discrimination on the basis of other stigmatized identities is linked to substance use, including alcohol [19] and preliminary evidence suggests that experiencing weight stigma is associated with alcohol dependence [20]. Internalizing anti-fat attitudes may also encourage unhealthy coping mechanisms, as seen with medical students of higher weight who turn to alcohol or drugs [21]. Given the link between psychological distress and alcohol consumption [22], it is also plausible that the distress associated with weight stigma spurs unhealthy alcohol consumption. \n\nWEIGHT STIGMA AND SLEEP DISTURBANCE \n\nThere is a noticeable lack of research in the weight stigma literature on sleep [23], but there is reason to believe a relationship may exist given research on other stigmatized identities. For example, one systematic review found strong evidence that perceived discrimination is associated with poorer sleep, from both cross-sectional and prospective data [24]. In a large, nationally representative U.S. sample, individuals who experienced more everyday discrimination had worse objective sleep and reported greater sleep difficulties [25]. Another representative study found that perceived racial discrimination in healthcare environments independently predicted sleep disturbance [26]. Individuals with higher weight may likewise experience disturbed sleep given the chronic and pervasive nature of weight stigma. \n\nWEIGHT STIGMA AND GENDER DIFFERENCES \n\nA significant portion of weight stigma research has focused on women with higher weight. The dearth of research on men is likely due in part to evidence that women are more likely to experience weight stigma [27]. However, recent findings indicate that weight stigma is prevalent among men as well [28]. Previous research has also shown that not all weight stigma findings related to health behaviors are uniform across genders. For example, one study found that weight teasing by family members was associated with unhealthy weight control behaviors (e.g., skipping meals, fasting) among both males and females, however only females reported extreme weight control behaviors (e.g., using laxatives, vomiting) [29]. Gender differences have also been documented in adolescence as weight-related teasing predicted greater unhealthy weight control behaviors among boys, while girls were more likely to diet [30]. In the domain of physical activity, weight stigma was associated with more vigorous physical activity among higher weight men, but not for women [31]. In sum, there is still much to be determined in the domain of weight stigma and health behaviors. The present study fills a critical gap in the extant literature by examining multiple health behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sleep, alcohol use, eating behavior) at once, across gender and weight status. It was hypothesized that: (1) Greater weight stigma would be associated with poorer health behaviors in the domains of physical activity, sleep disturbance, alcohol use, disordered eating, and comfort eating; (2) Weight status would moderate the association of weight stigma with health behaviors, such that the relationship would be stronger for individuals with higher BMIs and selfperceived weight. Given limited prior research, we made no directional hypotheses regarding gender differences. All a priori hypotheses and confirmatory analyses were preregistered on the Open Science Framework, https://osf.io/ g4wz9?view_only=d0fafe6d7cc24846b1b1cd6b59a3783e.\n\nMETHODS \n\nParticipants The UCLA North General Institutional Review Board approved the present study. Participants (N = 2022) in the United States were recruited for the Eating in America Study through a panel on the online survey platform, Qualtrics, between December 2019 and January 2020. Individuals who were English speaking and at least 18 years of age were eligible to participate. Individuals were census matched according to national quotas for age, self-reported gender, income, race/ethnicity, and census region in the U. S. Eligible participants reviewed an online information sheet and gave their consent to participate. Several steps were taken to obtain the final analytic sample in this cross-sectional study. First, a random sample (n = 500) was removed from the full dataset (N = 2022) to conduct exploratory analyses; the final exploratory sample was comprised of 438 participants after exclusion criteria were applied. Then, participants were removed from the full dataset if they met at least one of the following exclusion criteria: failed attention checks (n = 202), biologically implausible height (90 inches; n = 25), weight (1000 lb; n = 29), or BMI values (70; n = 65) [32]. This yielded a sample size of 1759 after removing 263 individuals. Finally, any individuals from the exploratory sample who had not already been excluded were removed to obtain the final sample (N = 1327 participants). The exploratory sample was not included in the confirmatory analyses. Measures Participants completed a series of self-report measures, including assessments of daily experiences with anticipated weight stigma and weight-based discrimination, physical activity, sleep disturbance, alcohol use, disordered eating, comfort eating, demographic questions, and anthropometric measurements. Weight stigma Weight stigma was assessed using a 2-item composite measure of daily anticipated and experienced weight stigma (see validation work in Online Supplementary Materials 4). Individuals indicated the frequency of anticipating weight stigma (\u0093In your day-to-day life, how often are you concerned about or worried you will be negatively stereotyped or mistreated because of your weight?\u0094) and experiencing weight stigma (\u0093In your day-to-day life, how often are you treated with less respect, harassed, or discriminated against because of your weight?\u0094) on a 4-point response scale from (Not at all\u0096Often). A mean score was computed (? = 0.86). Physical activity Physical activity was measured with the validated [33], single item Stanford Leisure-Time Activity Categorical Item (LCAT), which comprises six activity categories ranging from sedentary to very active based on national health recommendations determined by the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Heart Association. Each category corresponds to an intensity level based on metabolic equivalents (METs). Participants selected the category that best described their physical activity over the past month. Sleep disturbance Sleep disturbance was assessed using the 6-item Sleep Disturbance short form from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System item bank [34]. Participants reported sleep quality over the past week on a 5-point scale (Very Poor\u0096Very Good) and frequency of sleep disturbance in the past week on a 5-point scale (Not at all\u0096Very Much). A mean score was calculated for each individual, with higher scores indicating greater sleep disturbance (? = 0.90). Alcohol use Alcohol use was measured by the 3-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-C [35]. Participants indicated quantity of drinks on a typical day in the past year using a 6- point scale (0\u009610 or more drinks), frequency of drinking behavior in the past 30 days on a 6-point scale (Never\u0096Six or more times a week) and frequency of binge drinking behavior in the past year on a 5-point scale (Never\u0096Daily or Almost Daily). All three items were summed to calculate a total alcohol use score (? = 0.75). Disordered eating Disordered eating was measured using the 12-item Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire Short (EDE-QS) [36]. Participants indicated their eating and food-related behaviors, thoughts, and feelings over the past 7 days on a 4- point rating scale (0\u00967 days or Not at all\u0096Markedly). Response values range from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating higher eating disorder symptomatology. A mean disordered eating score was calculated (? = 0.89). Comfort eating Comfort eating was defined as, \u0093When feeling a negative emotion, some people eat more food and/or eat more unhealthy food than usual\u0097a behavior described as comfort eating.\u0094 Participants indicated their frequency of comfort eating by selecting the number of days they engaged in comfort eating in the last 30 days. This item is distinct from disordered eating, as measured by the EDE-QS, which assesses food intake and compulsive exercise in relation to weight and body image concerns. Perceived weight status We assessed perceived weight status on a 7-point Likert scale (Very Underweight\u0096Very Overweight) in which participants identified their perceived weight category [37]. Body mass index (BMI) BMI was calculated from self-reported height and weight and categorized as: \u0093Underweight,\u0094 30. Covariates Covariates of age, highest level of education, gender (Woman, Man, Non-Binary/Other), race/ethnicity, and BMI were included in the analyses to test the independent effect of weight stigma on the outcomes. Analytic strategy Exploratory analyses We employed a two-stage investigation to run exploratory and confirmatory analyses [38]. In stage 1, exploratory analyses were conducted on a random subset (n = 438) to examine associations between weight stigma and the dependent variables: physical activity, sleep disturbance, alcohol use, disordered eating, and comfort eating, controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and BMI. Linear regression models estimated for each behavioral variable found that all health behaviors except for physical activity were significantly associated with the composite weight stigma measure. These exploratory analyses appear in Online Supplementary Materials 1. In stage 2, only the remaining unexamined data (N = 1327) were used to conduct the confirmatory analyses. As noted in the pre-registration, physical activity was included despite it not emerging as significant in preliminary analyses given the conflicting existing literature. In our analyses, we controlled for BMI to ensure that the relationship between weight stigma and health behaviors was not a result of confounder bias, that is, to ensure that this relationship did not emerge simply because higher BMI individuals report both greater weight stigma and poorer health behaviors. It is possible that BMI is instead a collider, or a variable that is caused by both our predictor and outcome variables [39]. Controlling for a collider can artificially create an association where one may not exist. Although greater weight stigma [40] and poorer health behaviors [41] can predict higher BMI, the results from our unadjusted models (see Table 3) are consistent with the adjusted models, suggesting that controlling for BMI does not introduce collider bias. We also examined BMI as a moderator of the relationship between weight stigma and health behaviors, as previous work has shown that effects of weight stigma exposure increase as weight increases [42]. Statistical analyses Using linear regression models, the composite weight stigma score was entered as the main predictor variable and 1502 K. M. Lee et al. the following health behaviors were entered as the dependent variables in separate models: physical activity, sleep disturbance, alcohol use, disordered eating, and comfort eating. Age, education, race/ethnicity, gender, and BMI were included as a priori covariates. All variables were normally distributed, except for comfort eating in the exploratory and confirmatory samples. The skewed distributions were corrected using natural log transformations and all analyses were performed with the natural log values for comfort eating. For moderation analyses, PROCESS macro (model #1) [43] was used to test the effects of BMI, perceived weight status, and gender as unique moderators on the relationship between weight stigma and all health behaviors. The same covariates were included in these models. BMI was added as a covariate in the models testing perceived weight status and gender as moderators. Given that the same pattern of results emerged for perceived weight status, these analyses appear in Online Supplementary Materials 2.\n\nRESULTS \n\nThe overall sample (N = 1327) had a mean age of 47.7 years (SD = 17.2) with an average BMI of 28.0 (SD = 7.4; range: 12.0\u009668.4). Table 1 lists sample characteristics for confirmatory and exploratory samples. Those with missing data were excluded from the confirmatory analyses: BMI (n = 1), physical activity (n = 4), and comfort eating (n = 2). Confirmatory zero-order correlations among study variables appear in Table 2 and exploratory zero-order correlations and descriptive statistics appear in Table 4. In the confirmatory sample, 42% of participants reported weight stigma. Linear regressions estimated the associations between weight stigma and the continuous outcomes of physical activity, sleep disturbance, alcohol use, disordered eating, and comfort eating (Table 3). Adjusting for covariates of age, BMI, education, gender, and race/ethnicity, weight stigma was significantly associated with all outcomes, except for physical activity. These findings replicate those of the exploratory regression analyses from stage 1 of the investigation (see Online Supplementary Materials 1). Unadjusted models showed significant associations between weight stigma and all outcomes (Table 3). Eta-squared (?2 ) effect size calculations indicate that weight stigma uniquely accounted for 17.5% of the variance in disordered eating; 4.0% of the variance in sleep disturbance; 3.2% of the variance in comfort eating; and 0.7% of the variance for alcohol use. Moderation models tested whether BMI modified the association of weight stigma with outcomes. BMI significantly moderated the association of weight stigma with disordered eating (b = ?0.01, SE = 0.002, 95% CI [?0.01, ?0.005], t(1319) = ?4.45, p < 0.001; Fig. 1) and alcohol use (b = ?0.03, SE = 0.01, 95% CI [?0.05, ?0.01], t (1319) = ?2.72, p = 0.007; Fig. 2), but not the other health behaviors (see Online Supplementary Materials 3, Table 3). Using the Johnson\u0096Neyman technique, the relationship between weight stigma and disordered eating appeared to be weaker as BMI increased, up to a BMI of 55.5 (\u0093severe obesity\u0094) and between weight stigma and alcohol, up to a BMI of 32.09 (\u0093obesity\u0094). Lastly, exploratory moderation analyses were conducted to test the effect of gender on the relationship between weight stigma and health behaviors. No significant interaction effects were observed (see Online Supplementary Materials 3, Table 4).\n\nDISCUSSION \n\nThe present study employed a two-stage research investigation to examine the relationship between weight stigma and several health behaviors in a large sample of U.S. adults. As predicted, weight stigma was significantly associated with greater disordered eating, comfort eating, alcohol use, and sleep disturbance, after controlling for covariates. No such relationship was observed for physical activity. Targeting health behaviors (e.g., eating) to achieve weight loss is common in weight-focused health promotion policies. These policies assume that individuals can improve their health by losing weight, employing weight stigma as one strategy for motivating behavior change [5]. However, our findings indicate that weight stigma is associated with poorer health behaviors, independent of BMI. Given that physical health and weight are largely shaped by factors outside of an individual\u0092s control (i.e., genetics and social determinants like socioeconomic status) [5], it is concerning that multiple behaviors, for which individuals have some control over, may be undermined by weight stigma. Furthermore, a lower BMI may not necessarily be protective against weight stigma. In our sample, individuals across the weight spectrum, not only those with overweight or obese BMIs, reported weight stigma. In fact, moderation analyses indicated that individuals with lower BMIs showed greater disordered eating and alcohol use in the face of weight stigma. These results emerged despite individuals with higher weight reporting greater daily weight stigma. One explanation for the observed differences in health behavioral outcomes across the weight spectrum is that infrequent health behaviors may be less likely to be enacted as coping strategies. For instance, previous research has shown that alcohol use decreases as BMI increases among females with higher weight [44]. Thus, using food, instead of alcohol, may be the more common coping strategy among individuals with higher BMIs, as previous research suggests [45]. Nonetheless, the sizes of the moderation effects were very small, with some confidence intervals functionally at zero, and thus further interpretation of the present findings should only be done with caution. Prior research has found conflicting evidence for the relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. Some studies have found that greater weight stigma is associated with short-term increases in reported exercise behavior [16, 46]. Others have shown that weight stigma is positively correlated with increased exercise avoidance, but has no direct link to self-reported exercise [14, 47]. The current study adds to the latter base of evidence showing no relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. One possible explanation is that participants were asked about their daily experiences with weight stigma, which may not correspond to their level of physical activity over the past month. Ecological momentary assessment methodology may provide better insight into this relationship, as demonstrated by Vartanian et al. who examined health motivations following stigmatizing events in daily life [48]. Despite emerging evidence that weight stigma is prevalent among men [28], there is a lack of research on men\u0092s health outcomes related to weight stigma. In this study, moderation by gender was not observed for any outcome. These results are consistent with previous research reporting no gender differences in poor health outcomes such as mortality and obesity due to weight stigma [3, 49]. Men may also feel pressured to meet societal body standards and thus may display the same magnitude of associations between weight stigma and health behaviors. It is recommended that the null gender findings are interpreted with caution, as more research is needed. How might weight stigma influence an individual\u0092s health behaviors? One potential mechanism is stress. Previous work suggests that weight stigma is stressful [6, 50] and experimental lab studies manipulating weight stigma have shown that individuals with higher weight, as well as those who perceive themselves as overweight, show elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol following exposure to a weight-stigmatizing event [51, 52]. Additionally, some research has found that individuals who experience more weight-based discrimination have higher hair cortisol levels\u0097a finding most pronounced in those at the highest BMI [53]. Individuals who experience greater stress may engage in more unhealthy coping behaviors. Indeed, stress can drive changes in behaviors such as eating, physical activity, and sleep [54]. For example, Tataranni et al. administered synthetic cortisol vs. placebo and found greater food consumption in the cortisol group [55]. This early work is supported by accumulating evidence that cortisol is associated with increased caloric intake and greater abdominal fat storage [56]. The health behavior pathway may not be independent from that of stress but rather reflect a serial mediation model, wherein weight stigma increases stress that in turn causes decrements in health behaviors. The present study contributes to the weight stigma literature in several ways. As noted, a key strength of this study is the assessment of several health behaviors within a large, national census-matched sample. Previous studies that have examined weight stigma in relation to different health behaviors have often had small sample sizes or were limited to female subjects. Thus, the present study may provide more generalizable information about health behaviors in the U.S. A related strength of the study is that higher BMI scores were well-represented in the sample, with 31.4% meeting BMI criteria for obesity. This is a closer estimate of the proportion of the American population that is classified with obesity (42%) compared to previous studies [57]. Therefore, there is greater confidence that these findings reflect the experiences of individuals with obesity in the population, aiding generalizability. Lastly, we enhance reproducibility by presenting a twostage research program of exploratory and confirmatory analyses based on recommended open science practices. There are some limitations to consider. First, a composite weight stigma score was used due to survey constraints. While early tests indicate good construct validity, additional psychometric testing is warranted (see Online Supplementary Materials 4). Another limitation is the use of selfreported weight, which is subject to inaccuracies. Additionally, the data collection period overlapped with winter holidays. Individuals may have made new year\u0092s health resolutions, and therefore the self-reported health behaviors may be more indicative of newly established goals rather than typical health habits. However, such resolutions would likely dampen, rather than magnify, the relationship between weight stigma and poor health behaviors. Lastly, the study is cross-sectional and therefore causal direction cannot be determined. Weight stigma may operate as a feedback loop that leads to weight gain through certain behaviors such as comfort eating [6], but further investigation is required. Given survey constraints, weight bias internalization was not assessed. Future research should build on these findings to determine the potential role of weight bias internalization in these health behaviors. Despite these limitations, these study\u0092s findings show that weight stigma is significantly associated with several health behaviors. If future research confirms that this is indeed a causal relationship, weight stigma could cumulatively undermine physical health over time. Taken together, these findings highlight weight stigma as a potential barrier to healthy behaviors, and suggest that one strategy to improve population health may be to reduce weight stigma. Though more research is needed, it may be important to employ more weight-inclusive approaches to health promotion, such as removing stigmatizing language or weight outcomes from health policies and program objectives [5].\nPage 1 of 1\n\n", "folder": "text/2023-06-20 full", "system_role": "You are a helpful assistant.", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 1000, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613", "qna": {"date": "2023-06-20 1431", "folder": "text/2023-06-20 full", "article_title": "Weight stigma and health behaviors: evidence from the Eating in America Study", "system_role": "You are a helpful assistant.", "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613", "text": "Weight stigma and health behaviors: evidence from the Eating in America Study\n\nINTRODUCTION \nWeight stigma is pervasive. Higher weight individuals are stigmatized across many contexts, including healthcare, employment and income, education, media, and interpersonal relationships [1]. Repeated exposure to weight stigma may be consequential as considerable evidence suggests that weight stigma undermines physical health even when controlling for body mass index (BMI), which addresses the potential confound that higher adiposity begets both weight stigma and poorer health. For instance, weight discrimination predicts physiological dysregulation involving a suite of outcomes (e.g., blood pressure; inflammation; cholesterol) [2], and even mortality [3]. These findings indicate a vulnerable health profile of individuals stigmatized for their weight, particularly those with overweight or obesity. Yet, it remains unclear how weight stigma may also impact several health behaviors, which is one likely pathway through which weight stigma \u0093gets under the skin\u0094 to generate poorer health outcomes. Scholars have previously suggested that weight stigma may play a positive role in motivating individuals to engage in health behaviors that could lead to weight loss\u0097presumably as a way to improve health [4]. This contention, however, is not empirically supported. Rather, stigmatizing individuals for their weight is consistently associated with negative consequences [5]. Although health behaviors are modifiable ways to improve health across the weight spectrum, individuals who experience weight stigma may cope with this mistreatment by engaging in health compromising behaviors. For instance, a person who has been stigmatized because of their size may be less likely to go to the gym, as this is an environment that puts them at risk for further stigmatization. Individuals encountering weight stigma may also eat to comfort their distress [6]. Although previous research has shown that, independent of BMI, weight stigma is associated with increased maladaptive eating behaviors and decreased motivation to exercise [7], less is known about other common health behaviors such as alcohol use and sleep. Thus, the present study examined the relationship between weight stigma and several modifiable health behaviors in a large U.S. sample. In the next section, the existing literature on weight stigma is outlined across four different health behaviors: eating behavior, physical activity, alcohol use, and sleep. Where available, findings pertaining to gender differences in these areas of research are summarized. As will become evident below, there are notable gaps in this literature that we address in the present study. \n\nWEIGHT STIGMA AND EATING BEHAVIOR \n\nEating a healthy diet helps prevent noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer [8]. However, weight stigma may pose one barrier to healthy eating behavior. In laboratory settings, stigmatizing individuals with higher weight (or individuals who perceived themselves as such) led to short-term increases in eating of highfat, -sugar, and -calorie foods [9]. This eating is theorized to be a form of comfort eating due to the stress of weight stigma [6] and at least one study has found an association between weight stigma and emotional eating [10]. Weight stigma is also associated with unhealthy weight control behaviors and disordered eating such as binge eating [11]. Additionally, there is some longitudinal evidence that shows the potential long-term effects of weight stigma on adolescents\u0092 eating and weight control practices. For example, one study found that adolescent girls who were labeled \u0093too fat\u0094 showed increased bulimic and unhealthy weight control behaviors (e.g., using diet pills) 5 years later [12]. \n\nWEIGHT STIGMA AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY \n\nEngaging in regular physical activity is associated with numerous health benefits, including lower risk for premature all-cause mortality, hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [13]. For higher weight individuals, weight stigma may be a barrier to engage in physical activity, though the findings are mixed. Some studies have shown that weight stigma is associated with greater exercise avoidance [14] and lower exercise selfefficacy and intentions [15]. One study found that weight bias internalization was associated with lower levels of exercise and self-efficacy, while experienced weight stigma predicted higher levels of exercise [16]. Yet other research found a positive relationship between weight discrimination and greater sedentary behavior among middle-aged and older adults [17]. \n\nWEIGHT STIGMA AND ALCOHOL USE \n\nAlcohol consumption, particularly heavy drinking, has been associated with heart disease, stroke, and some cancers [18]. There is a large body of research showing that perceived discrimination on the basis of other stigmatized identities is linked to substance use, including alcohol [19] and preliminary evidence suggests that experiencing weight stigma is associated with alcohol dependence [20]. Internalizing anti-fat attitudes may also encourage unhealthy coping mechanisms, as seen with medical students of higher weight who turn to alcohol or drugs [21]. Given the link between psychological distress and alcohol consumption [22], it is also plausible that the distress associated with weight stigma spurs unhealthy alcohol consumption. \n\nWEIGHT STIGMA AND SLEEP DISTURBANCE \n\nThere is a noticeable lack of research in the weight stigma literature on sleep [23], but there is reason to believe a relationship may exist given research on other stigmatized identities. For example, one systematic review found strong evidence that perceived discrimination is associated with poorer sleep, from both cross-sectional and prospective data [24]. In a large, nationally representative U.S. sample, individuals who experienced more everyday discrimination had worse objective sleep and reported greater sleep difficulties [25]. Another representative study found that perceived racial discrimination in healthcare environments independently predicted sleep disturbance [26]. Individuals with higher weight may likewise experience disturbed sleep given the chronic and pervasive nature of weight stigma. \n\nWEIGHT STIGMA AND GENDER DIFFERENCES \n\nA significant portion of weight stigma research has focused on women with higher weight. The dearth of research on men is likely due in part to evidence that women are more likely to experience weight stigma [27]. However, recent findings indicate that weight stigma is prevalent among men as well [28]. Previous research has also shown that not all weight stigma findings related to health behaviors are uniform across genders. For example, one study found that weight teasing by family members was associated with unhealthy weight control behaviors (e.g., skipping meals, fasting) among both males and females, however only females reported extreme weight control behaviors (e.g., using laxatives, vomiting) [29]. Gender differences have also been documented in adolescence as weight-related teasing predicted greater unhealthy weight control behaviors among boys, while girls were more likely to diet [30]. In the domain of physical activity, weight stigma was associated with more vigorous physical activity among higher weight men, but not for women [31]. In sum, there is still much to be determined in the domain of weight stigma and health behaviors. The present study fills a critical gap in the extant literature by examining multiple health behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sleep, alcohol use, eating behavior) at once, across gender and weight status. It was hypothesized that: (1) Greater weight stigma would be associated with poorer health behaviors in the domains of physical activity, sleep disturbance, alcohol use, disordered eating, and comfort eating; (2) Weight status would moderate the association of weight stigma with health behaviors, such that the relationship would be stronger for individuals with higher BMIs and selfperceived weight. Given limited prior research, we made no directional hypotheses regarding gender differences. All a priori hypotheses and confirmatory analyses were preregistered on the Open Science Framework, https://osf.io/ g4wz9?view_only=d0fafe6d7cc24846b1b1cd6b59a3783e.\n\nMETHODS \n\nParticipants The UCLA North General Institutional Review Board approved the present study. Participants (N = 2022) in the United States were recruited for the Eating in America Study through a panel on the online survey platform, Qualtrics, between December 2019 and January 2020. Individuals who were English speaking and at least 18 years of age were eligible to participate. Individuals were census matched according to national quotas for age, self-reported gender, income, race/ethnicity, and census region in the U. S. Eligible participants reviewed an online information sheet and gave their consent to participate. Several steps were taken to obtain the final analytic sample in this cross-sectional study. First, a random sample (n = 500) was removed from the full dataset (N = 2022) to conduct exploratory analyses; the final exploratory sample was comprised of 438 participants after exclusion criteria were applied. Then, participants were removed from the full dataset if they met at least one of the following exclusion criteria: failed attention checks (n = 202), biologically implausible height (90 inches; n = 25), weight (1000 lb; n = 29), or BMI values (70; n = 65) [32]. This yielded a sample size of 1759 after removing 263 individuals. Finally, any individuals from the exploratory sample who had not already been excluded were removed to obtain the final sample (N = 1327 participants). The exploratory sample was not included in the confirmatory analyses. Measures Participants completed a series of self-report measures, including assessments of daily experiences with anticipated weight stigma and weight-based discrimination, physical activity, sleep disturbance, alcohol use, disordered eating, comfort eating, demographic questions, and anthropometric measurements. Weight stigma Weight stigma was assessed using a 2-item composite measure of daily anticipated and experienced weight stigma (see validation work in Online Supplementary Materials 4). Individuals indicated the frequency of anticipating weight stigma (\u0093In your day-to-day life, how often are you concerned about or worried you will be negatively stereotyped or mistreated because of your weight?\u0094) and experiencing weight stigma (\u0093In your day-to-day life, how often are you treated with less respect, harassed, or discriminated against because of your weight?\u0094) on a 4-point response scale from (Not at all\u0096Often). A mean score was computed (? = 0.86). Physical activity Physical activity was measured with the validated [33], single item Stanford Leisure-Time Activity Categorical Item (LCAT), which comprises six activity categories ranging from sedentary to very active based on national health recommendations determined by the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Heart Association. Each category corresponds to an intensity level based on metabolic equivalents (METs). Participants selected the category that best described their physical activity over the past month. Sleep disturbance Sleep disturbance was assessed using the 6-item Sleep Disturbance short form from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System item bank [34]. Participants reported sleep quality over the past week on a 5-point scale (Very Poor\u0096Very Good) and frequency of sleep disturbance in the past week on a 5-point scale (Not at all\u0096Very Much). A mean score was calculated for each individual, with higher scores indicating greater sleep disturbance (? = 0.90). Alcohol use Alcohol use was measured by the 3-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-C [35]. Participants indicated quantity of drinks on a typical day in the past year using a 6- point scale (0\u009610 or more drinks), frequency of drinking behavior in the past 30 days on a 6-point scale (Never\u0096Six or more times a week) and frequency of binge drinking behavior in the past year on a 5-point scale (Never\u0096Daily or Almost Daily). All three items were summed to calculate a total alcohol use score (? = 0.75). Disordered eating Disordered eating was measured using the 12-item Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire Short (EDE-QS) [36]. Participants indicated their eating and food-related behaviors, thoughts, and feelings over the past 7 days on a 4- point rating scale (0\u00967 days or Not at all\u0096Markedly). Response values range from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating higher eating disorder symptomatology. A mean disordered eating score was calculated (? = 0.89). Comfort eating Comfort eating was defined as, \u0093When feeling a negative emotion, some people eat more food and/or eat more unhealthy food than usual\u0097a behavior described as comfort eating.\u0094 Participants indicated their frequency of comfort eating by selecting the number of days they engaged in comfort eating in the last 30 days. This item is distinct from disordered eating, as measured by the EDE-QS, which assesses food intake and compulsive exercise in relation to weight and body image concerns. Perceived weight status We assessed perceived weight status on a 7-point Likert scale (Very Underweight\u0096Very Overweight) in which participants identified their perceived weight category [37]. Body mass index (BMI) BMI was calculated from self-reported height and weight and categorized as: \u0093Underweight,\u0094 30. Covariates Covariates of age, highest level of education, gender (Woman, Man, Non-Binary/Other), race/ethnicity, and BMI were included in the analyses to test the independent effect of weight stigma on the outcomes. Analytic strategy Exploratory analyses We employed a two-stage investigation to run exploratory and confirmatory analyses [38]. In stage 1, exploratory analyses were conducted on a random subset (n = 438) to examine associations between weight stigma and the dependent variables: physical activity, sleep disturbance, alcohol use, disordered eating, and comfort eating, controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and BMI. Linear regression models estimated for each behavioral variable found that all health behaviors except for physical activity were significantly associated with the composite weight stigma measure. These exploratory analyses appear in Online Supplementary Materials 1. In stage 2, only the remaining unexamined data (N = 1327) were used to conduct the confirmatory analyses. As noted in the pre-registration, physical activity was included despite it not emerging as significant in preliminary analyses given the conflicting existing literature. In our analyses, we controlled for BMI to ensure that the relationship between weight stigma and health behaviors was not a result of confounder bias, that is, to ensure that this relationship did not emerge simply because higher BMI individuals report both greater weight stigma and poorer health behaviors. It is possible that BMI is instead a collider, or a variable that is caused by both our predictor and outcome variables [39]. Controlling for a collider can artificially create an association where one may not exist. Although greater weight stigma [40] and poorer health behaviors [41] can predict higher BMI, the results from our unadjusted models (see Table 3) are consistent with the adjusted models, suggesting that controlling for BMI does not introduce collider bias. We also examined BMI as a moderator of the relationship between weight stigma and health behaviors, as previous work has shown that effects of weight stigma exposure increase as weight increases [42]. Statistical analyses Using linear regression models, the composite weight stigma score was entered as the main predictor variable and 1502 K. M. Lee et al. the following health behaviors were entered as the dependent variables in separate models: physical activity, sleep disturbance, alcohol use, disordered eating, and comfort eating. Age, education, race/ethnicity, gender, and BMI were included as a priori covariates. All variables were normally distributed, except for comfort eating in the exploratory and confirmatory samples. The skewed distributions were corrected using natural log transformations and all analyses were performed with the natural log values for comfort eating. For moderation analyses, PROCESS macro (model #1) [43] was used to test the effects of BMI, perceived weight status, and gender as unique moderators on the relationship between weight stigma and all health behaviors. The same covariates were included in these models. BMI was added as a covariate in the models testing perceived weight status and gender as moderators. Given that the same pattern of results emerged for perceived weight status, these analyses appear in Online Supplementary Materials 2.\n\nRESULTS \n\nThe overall sample (N = 1327) had a mean age of 47.7 years (SD = 17.2) with an average BMI of 28.0 (SD = 7.4; range: 12.0\u009668.4). Table 1 lists sample characteristics for confirmatory and exploratory samples. Those with missing data were excluded from the confirmatory analyses: BMI (n = 1), physical activity (n = 4), and comfort eating (n = 2). Confirmatory zero-order correlations among study variables appear in Table 2 and exploratory zero-order correlations and descriptive statistics appear in Table 4. In the confirmatory sample, 42% of participants reported weight stigma. Linear regressions estimated the associations between weight stigma and the continuous outcomes of physical activity, sleep disturbance, alcohol use, disordered eating, and comfort eating (Table 3). Adjusting for covariates of age, BMI, education, gender, and race/ethnicity, weight stigma was significantly associated with all outcomes, except for physical activity. These findings replicate those of the exploratory regression analyses from stage 1 of the investigation (see Online Supplementary Materials 1). Unadjusted models showed significant associations between weight stigma and all outcomes (Table 3). Eta-squared (?2 ) effect size calculations indicate that weight stigma uniquely accounted for 17.5% of the variance in disordered eating; 4.0% of the variance in sleep disturbance; 3.2% of the variance in comfort eating; and 0.7% of the variance for alcohol use. Moderation models tested whether BMI modified the association of weight stigma with outcomes. BMI significantly moderated the association of weight stigma with disordered eating (b = ?0.01, SE = 0.002, 95% CI [?0.01, ?0.005], t(1319) = ?4.45, p < 0.001; Fig. 1) and alcohol use (b = ?0.03, SE = 0.01, 95% CI [?0.05, ?0.01], t (1319) = ?2.72, p = 0.007; Fig. 2), but not the other health behaviors (see Online Supplementary Materials 3, Table 3). Using the Johnson\u0096Neyman technique, the relationship between weight stigma and disordered eating appeared to be weaker as BMI increased, up to a BMI of 55.5 (\u0093severe obesity\u0094) and between weight stigma and alcohol, up to a BMI of 32.09 (\u0093obesity\u0094). Lastly, exploratory moderation analyses were conducted to test the effect of gender on the relationship between weight stigma and health behaviors. No significant interaction effects were observed (see Online Supplementary Materials 3, Table 4).\n\nDISCUSSION \n\nThe present study employed a two-stage research investigation to examine the relationship between weight stigma and several health behaviors in a large sample of U.S. adults. As predicted, weight stigma was significantly associated with greater disordered eating, comfort eating, alcohol use, and sleep disturbance, after controlling for covariates. No such relationship was observed for physical activity. Targeting health behaviors (e.g., eating) to achieve weight loss is common in weight-focused health promotion policies. These policies assume that individuals can improve their health by losing weight, employing weight stigma as one strategy for motivating behavior change [5]. However, our findings indicate that weight stigma is associated with poorer health behaviors, independent of BMI. Given that physical health and weight are largely shaped by factors outside of an individual\u0092s control (i.e., genetics and social determinants like socioeconomic status) [5], it is concerning that multiple behaviors, for which individuals have some control over, may be undermined by weight stigma. Furthermore, a lower BMI may not necessarily be protective against weight stigma. In our sample, individuals across the weight spectrum, not only those with overweight or obese BMIs, reported weight stigma. In fact, moderation analyses indicated that individuals with lower BMIs showed greater disordered eating and alcohol use in the face of weight stigma. These results emerged despite individuals with higher weight reporting greater daily weight stigma. One explanation for the observed differences in health behavioral outcomes across the weight spectrum is that infrequent health behaviors may be less likely to be enacted as coping strategies. For instance, previous research has shown that alcohol use decreases as BMI increases among females with higher weight [44]. Thus, using food, instead of alcohol, may be the more common coping strategy among individuals with higher BMIs, as previous research suggests [45]. Nonetheless, the sizes of the moderation effects were very small, with some confidence intervals functionally at zero, and thus further interpretation of the present findings should only be done with caution. Prior research has found conflicting evidence for the relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. Some studies have found that greater weight stigma is associated with short-term increases in reported exercise behavior [16, 46]. Others have shown that weight stigma is positively correlated with increased exercise avoidance, but has no direct link to self-reported exercise [14, 47]. The current study adds to the latter base of evidence showing no relationship between weight stigma and physical activity. One possible explanation is that participants were asked about their daily experiences with weight stigma, which may not correspond to their level of physical activity over the past month. Ecological momentary assessment methodology may provide better insight into this relationship, as demonstrated by Vartanian et al. who examined health motivations following stigmatizing events in daily life [48]. Despite emerging evidence that weight stigma is prevalent among men [28], there is a lack of research on men\u0092s health outcomes related to weight stigma. In this study, moderation by gender was not observed for any outcome. These results are consistent with previous research reporting no gender differences in poor health outcomes such as mortality and obesity due to weight stigma [3, 49]. Men may also feel pressured to meet societal body standards and thus may display the same magnitude of associations between weight stigma and health behaviors. It is recommended that the null gender findings are interpreted with caution, as more research is needed. How might weight stigma influence an individual\u0092s health behaviors? One potential mechanism is stress. Previous work suggests that weight stigma is stressful [6, 50] and experimental lab studies manipulating weight stigma have shown that individuals with higher weight, as well as those who perceive themselves as overweight, show elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol following exposure to a weight-stigmatizing event [51, 52]. Additionally, some research has found that individuals who experience more weight-based discrimination have higher hair cortisol levels\u0097a finding most pronounced in those at the highest BMI [53]. Individuals who experience greater stress may engage in more unhealthy coping behaviors. Indeed, stress can drive changes in behaviors such as eating, physical activity, and sleep [54]. For example, Tataranni et al. administered synthetic cortisol vs. placebo and found greater food consumption in the cortisol group [55]. This early work is supported by accumulating evidence that cortisol is associated with increased caloric intake and greater abdominal fat storage [56]. The health behavior pathway may not be independent from that of stress but rather reflect a serial mediation model, wherein weight stigma increases stress that in turn causes decrements in health behaviors. The present study contributes to the weight stigma literature in several ways.
