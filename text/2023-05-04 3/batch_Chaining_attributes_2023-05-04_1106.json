The combination of diffi culty falling asleep, staying asleep, and having nonrestor\u0002ative sleep was not associated with an increased risk of hypertension; however, participants reporting dif\u0002fi culty falling asleep or sleep continuity problems had a slightly increased risk of hypertension at follow-up (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.03-1.3), even after control\u0002ling for confounders, so, the effects are somewhat inconsistent. If insomnia is associated with an increased risk of hypertension, it does not appear to be the case in older adults. In the Cardiovascular Health Study, a prospective cohort study of 1,419 older persons aged 73 years at baseline with a 6-year follow-up, insomnia complaints did not predict incident hypertension. 21 Lanfranchi et al 22 examined 13 subjects with normal BP but with chronic primary insomnia ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria) and 13 sex- and age-matched good sleepers using 24-h beat-to-beat BP along with electroencephalography spectral analysis. The sub\u0002jects with insomnia had higher nighttime systolic BP and a decrease in the day-to-night systolic BP dip\u0002ping compared with the good sleepers (both P 5 .01). Daytime diastolic BP ( P 5 .02) and nighttime diastolic BP ( P 5 .01) were higher in the subjects with insom\u0002nia, whereas the day-to-night diastolic BP dipping did not differ between the groups. A borderline asso\u0002ciation (r 5 0.38; P 5 .08) was noted between night\u0002time systolic BP and electroencephalography activity in the b frequency. Another confounder when examining the associa\u0002tion between insomnia and hypertension risk is that insomnia can lead to short sleep duration, and short sleep duration affects hypertension risk. Vgontzas et al 23 examined the joint effect of insomnia and objective short sleep duration on hypertension in a cross-sectional, population-based sample of 1,741 randomly selected adults from Pennsylvania. Insom\u0002nia was associated with a signifi cantly higher risk for hypertension and when confounding variables were adjusted for (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.6-3.7; P , .05).
