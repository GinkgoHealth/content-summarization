Conclusions
A growing number of studies have used the <5000 steps/day cut-point since it was first proposed to categorize individuals as sedentary(McKercher et al. 2009; Schmidt et al. 2009) or inactive(Cavanaugh et al. 2010; Hirvensalo et al. 2011; Tudor-Locke et al. 2001) and have subsequently included it in a more fully expanded graduated step index (Tudor-Locke and Bassett 2004; Tudor-Locke et al. 2008b). The profile of individuals more likely to be taking <5000 steps/day includes having a relatively lower household income and being female, older, of African-American vs. European-American heritage, a current vs. never smoker, and (or) living with chronic disease and (or) disability (including morbid obesity). Although the fallwinter season in the Northern hemisphere appears to discourage taking >5000 steps/day, little else is known about how other contextual factors foster such low levels of step-defined physical activity. Adverse measures of body composition have been consistently associated with taking <5000 steps/day in a range of population samples. Indicators of cardiometabolic risk, and specifically metabolic syndrome, have also been associated with taking <5000 steps/day. Using <5000 steps/day to identify and recruit physically inactive and (or) sedentary individuals to interventions focused on increasing physical activity and (or) reducing sedentary behaviours seems to be a prudent approach to maximizing the potential for effect in a population most at need, but this approach has not yet been adopted systematically. Interventions have typically focused on attaining a singular and lofty goal (e.g., 10?000 steps/day) (Bravata et al. 2007) and not necessarily on shifting individuals who take relatively few steps/day onto the next immediately higher categories (e.g., low active, defined as 50007500 steps/day, or somewhat active, defined as 75009999 steps/day (Tudor-Locke and Bassett 2004; Tudor-Locke et al. 2008b)). Short-term interventions to reduce step-defined physical activity to values <5000 steps/day conducted with small samples of young, healthy, and active individuals have shown dramatic adverse effects on a number of health parameters. Consistent implementation of a standardized steps/day definition for a sedentary lifestyle index would facilitate comparisons among studies and groups; however, unique sample distributions (i.e., generally active, or generally low active) may require tolerance for a degree of flexibility, including segmenting the <5000 steps/day category into basal activity (<2500 steps/day) and limited activity (25004999 steps/day) (Tudor-Locke et al. 2009a). A standardized definition would be useful for screening, recruiting, and tracking purposes. Although additional research is needed to further illuminate the appropriateness of using <5000 steps/day as a step-defined sedentary lifestyle index, especially its application across different types of objective monitoring technologies, it clearly demonstrates multiform utility for researchers and practitioners and, perhaps most importantly, for communicating with the general public at this time. There is currently little evidence to advocate any specific value indicative of a step-defined sedentary lifestyle index in children or adolescents.

Summary: Studies have found that taking 5000 steps or fewer per day can be considered as being inactive or sedentary. People who take fewer steps tend to have lower incomes, be female, older, and have chronic diseases or disabilities. Being inactive or sedentary can lead to negative changes in body composition and increase the risk of heart disease and other health problems. To help people become more active, it is a good idea to identify those who take fewer than 5000 steps per day and encourage them to increase their physical activity. It would be helpful to have a standard definition of steps per day to make it easier to compare different studies and groups.```",,,,"Rewrite this summary to include a statement of how it is relevant for the audience.

Interventions have typically focused on attaining a singular and lofty goal (e.g., 10?000 steps/day) (Bravata et al. 2007) and not necessarily on shifting individuals who take relatively few steps/day onto the next immediately higher categories (e.g., low active, defined as 50007500 steps/day, or somewhat active, defined as 75009999 steps/day (Tudor-Locke and Bassett 2004; Tudor-Locke et al. 2008b)). Short-term interventions to reduce step-defined physical activity to values <5000 steps/day conducted with small samples of young, healthy, and active individuals have shown dramatic adverse effects on a number of health parameters. Consistent implementation of a standardized steps/day definition for a sedentary lifestyle index would facilitate comparisons among studies and groups; however, unique sample distributions (i.e., generally active, or generally low active) may require tolerance for a degree of flexibility, including segmenting the <5000 steps/day category into basal activity (<2500 steps/day) and limited activity (25004999 steps/day) (Tudor-Locke et al. 2009a). A standardized definition would be useful for screening, recruiting, and tracking purposes. Although additional research is needed to further illuminate the appropriateness of using <5000 steps/day as a step-defined sedentary lifestyle index, especially its application across different types of objective monitoring technologies, it clearly demonstrates multiform utility for researchers and practitioners and, perhaps most importantly, for communicating with the general public at this time. There is currently little evidence to advocate any specific value indicative of a step-defined sedentary lifestyle index in children or adolescents.

""Research shows that people who take fewer than 5000 steps a day are considered inactive and are more likely to have health problems. It's important to gradually increase physical activity instead of trying to reach a big goal all at once. Having a clear definition of what it means to be inactive would be helpful for tracking progress. #fitness #health #physicalactivity""",,,,"Rewrite this summary to include a statement of how it is relevant for the audience.
