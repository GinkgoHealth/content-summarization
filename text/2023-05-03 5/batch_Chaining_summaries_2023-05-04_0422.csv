International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand Protein and Exercise 2022 article Protein safety
* Despite a plethora of studies demonstrating safety, much concern still exists surrounding the clinical implications of consuming increased amounts of protein, particularly on renal and hepatic health. The majority of these concerns stem from renal failure patients and educational dogma that has not been rewritten as evidence mounts to the contrary. Certainly, it is clear that people in renal failure benefit from protein-restricted diets [], but extending this pathophysiology to otherwise healthy exercise-trained individuals who are not clinically compromised is inappropriate. Published reviews on this topic consistently report that an increased intake of protein by competitive athletes and active individuals provides no indication of hepato-renal harm or damage [, ]. This is supported by a recent commentary [] which referenced recent reports from the World Health Organization [] where they indicated a lack of evidence linking a high protein diet to renal disease. Likewise, the panel charged with establishing reference nutrient values for Australia and New Zealand also stated there was no published evidence that elevated intakes of protein exerted any negative impact on kidney function in athletes or in general [].
* Recently, Antonio and colleagues published a series of original investigations that prescribed extremely high amounts of protein (~3.44.4 g/kg/day) and have consistently reported no harmful effects []. The first study in 2014 had resistance-trained individuals consume an extremely high protein diet (4.4 g/kg/day) for eight weeks and reported no change in adverse outcomes []. A follow-up investigation [] required participants to ingest up to 3.4 g/kg/day of protein for eight weeks while following a prescribed resistance training program and reported no changes in any of the blood parameters commonly used to assess clinical health (e.g., there was no effect on kidney or liver function). Their next study employed a crossover study design in twelve healthy resistance-trained men in which each participant was tested before and after for body composition as well as blood-markers of health and performance []. In one eight-week block, participants followed their normal (habitual) diet (2.6 g/kg/day) and in the other eight-week block, participants were prescribed to ingest greater than 3.0 g/kg/day resulting in an average protein intake of 2.9 g/kg/day over the entire 16-week study. No changes in body composition were reported, and importantly, no clinical side effects were observed throughout the study. Finally, the same group of authors published a one-year crossover study [] in fourteen healthy resistance-trained men. When prescribed to a high protein diet, the participants were instructed to ingest 3 g/kg/day and achieved an average intake of 3.3 g/kg/day and when following their normal diet they consumed 2.5 g/kg/day. This investigation showed that the chronic consumption of a high protein diet (i.e., for 1 year) had no harmful effects on kidney or liver function. Furthermore, there were no alterations in clinical markers of metabolism and blood lipids.
Key points
* Multiple review articles indicate that no controlled scientific evidence exists indicating that increased intakes of protein pose any health risks in healthy, exercising individuals.
* Statements by large regulatory bodies have also indicated that concerns about ones health secondary to ingesting high amounts of protein are unfounded.
* A series of controlled investigations spanning up to one year in duration utilizing protein intakes of up to 2.53.3 g/kg/day in healthy resistance-trained individuals consistently indicate that increased intakes of protein exert no harmful effect on blood lipids or markers of kidney and liver function.

International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand Protein and Exercise 2022 article Protein safety
* Despite a plethora of studies demonstrating safety, much concern still exists surrounding the clinical implications of consuming increased amounts of protein, particularly on renal and hepatic health. The majority of these concerns stem from renal failure patients and educational dogma that has not been rewritten as evidence mounts to the contrary. Certainly, it is clear that people in renal failure benefit from protein-restricted diets [], but extending this pathophysiology to otherwise healthy exercise-trained individuals who are not clinically compromised is inappropriate. Published reviews on this topic consistently report that an increased intake of protein by competitive athletes and active individuals provides no indication of hepato-renal harm or damage [, ]. This is supported by a recent commentary [] which referenced recent reports from the World Health Organization [] where they indicated a lack of evidence linking a high protein diet to renal disease. Likewise, the panel charged with establishing reference nutrient values for Australia and New Zealand also stated there was no published evidence that elevated intakes of protein exerted any negative impact on kidney function in athletes or in general [].
* Recently, Antonio and colleagues published a series of original investigations that prescribed extremely high amounts of protein (~3.44.4 g/kg/day) and have consistently reported no harmful effects []. The first study in 2014 had resistance-trained individuals consume an extremely high protein diet (4.4 g/kg/day) for eight weeks and reported no change in adverse outcomes []. A follow-up investigation [] required participants to ingest up to 3.4 g/kg/day of protein for eight weeks while following a prescribed resistance training program and reported no changes in any of the blood parameters commonly used to assess clinical health (e.g., there was no effect on kidney or liver function). Their next study employed a crossover study design in twelve healthy resistance-trained men in which each participant was tested before and after for body composition as well as blood-markers of health and performance []. In one eight-week block, participants followed their normal (habitual) diet (2.6 g/kg/day) and in the other eight-week block, participants were prescribed to ingest greater than 3.0 g/kg/day resulting in an average protein intake of 2.9 g/kg/day over the entire 16-week study. No changes in body composition were reported, and importantly, no clinical side effects were observed throughout the study. Finally, the same group of authors published a one-year crossover study [] in fourteen healthy resistance-trained men. When prescribed to a high protein diet, the participants were instructed to ingest 3 g/kg/day and achieved an average intake of 3.3 g/kg/day and when following their normal diet they consumed 2.5 g/kg/day. This investigation showed that the chronic consumption of a high protein diet (i.e., for 1 year) had no harmful effects on kidney or liver function. Furthermore, there were no alterations in clinical markers of metabolism and blood lipids.
Key points
* Multiple review articles indicate that no controlled scientific evidence exists indicating that increased intakes of protein pose any health risks in healthy, exercising individuals.
* Statements by large regulatory bodies have also indicated that concerns about ones health secondary to ingesting high amounts of protein are unfounded.
* A series of controlled investigations spanning up to one year in duration utilizing protein intakes of up to 2.53.3 g/kg/day in healthy resistance-trained individuals consistently indicate that increased intakes of protein exert no harmful effect on blood lipids or markers of kidney and liver function.

Likewise, the panel charged with establishing reference nutrient values for Australia and New Zealand also stated there was no published evidence that elevated intakes of protein exerted any negative impact on kidney function in athletes or in general [].
* Recently, Antonio and colleagues published a series of original investigations that prescribed extremely high amounts of protein (~3.44.4 g/kg/day) and have consistently reported no harmful effects []. The first study in 2014 had resistance-trained individuals consume an extremely high protein diet (4.4 g/kg/day) for eight weeks and reported no change in adverse outcomes []. A follow-up investigation [] required participants to ingest up to 3.4 g/kg/day of protein for eight weeks while following a prescribed resistance training program and reported no changes in any of the blood parameters commonly used to assess clinical health (e.g., there was no effect on kidney or liver function). Their next study employed a crossover study design in twelve healthy resistance-trained men in which each participant was tested before and after for body composition as well as blood-markers of health and performance []. In one eight-week block, participants followed their normal (habitual) diet (2.6 g/kg/day) and in the other eight-week block, participants were prescribed to ingest greater than 3.0 g/kg/day resulting in an average protein intake of 2.9 g/kg/day over the entire 16-week study. No changes in body composition were reported, and importantly, no clinical side effects were observed throughout the study. Finally, the same group of authors published a one-year crossover study [] in fourteen healthy resistance-trained men. When prescribed to a high protein diet, the participants were instructed to ingest 3 g/kg/day and achieved an average intake of 3.3 g/kg/day and when following their normal diet they consumed 2.5 g/kg/day. This investigation showed that the chronic consumption of a high protein diet (i.e., for 1 year) had no harmful effects on kidney or liver function. Furthermore, there were no alterations in clinical markers of metabolism and blood lipids.
Key points
* Multiple review articles indicate that no controlled scientific evidence exists indicating that increased intakes of protein pose any health risks in healthy, exercising individuals.
* Statements by large regulatory bodies have also indicated that concerns about ones health secondary to ingesting high amounts of protein are unfounded.
* A series of controlled investigations spanning up to one year in duration utilizing protein intakes of up to 2.53.3 g/kg/day in healthy resistance-trained individuals consistently indicate that increased intakes of protein exert no harmful effect on blood lipids or markers of kidney and liver function.

* Despite a plethora of studies demonstrating safety, much concern still exists surrounding the clinical implications of consuming increased amounts of protein, particularly on renal and hepatic health. The majority of these concerns stem from renal failure patients and educational dogma that has not been rewritten as evidence mounts to the contrary.

This is supported by a recent commentary [] which referenced recent reports from the World Health Organization [] where they indicated a lack of evidence linking a high protein diet to renal disease. Likewise, the panel charged with establishing reference nutrient values for Australia and New Zealand also stated there was no published evidence that elevated intakes of protein exerted any negative impact on kidney function in athletes or in general [].
* Recently, Antonio and colleagues published a series of original investigations that prescribed extremely high amounts of protein (~3.44.4 g/kg/day) and have consistently reported no harmful effects []. The first study in 2014 had resistance-trained individuals consume an extremely high protein diet (4.4 g/kg/day) for eight weeks and reported no change in adverse outcomes []. A follow-up investigation [] required participants to ingest up to 3.4 g/kg/day of protein for eight weeks while following a prescribed resistance training program and reported no changes in any of the blood parameters commonly used to assess clinical health (e.g., there was no effect on kidney or liver function). Their next study employed a crossover study design in twelve healthy resistance-trained men in which each participant was tested before and after for body composition as well as blood-markers of health and performance []. In one eight-week block, participants followed their normal (habitual) diet (2.6 g/kg/day) and in the other eight-week block, participants were prescribed to ingest greater than 3.0 g/kg/day resulting in an average protein intake of 2.9 g/kg/day over the entire 16-week study. No changes in body composition were reported, and importantly, no clinical side effects were observed throughout the study. Finally, the same group of authors published a one-year crossover study [] in fourteen healthy resistance-trained men. When prescribed to a high protein diet, the participants were instructed to ingest 3 g/kg/day and achieved an average intake of 3.3 g/kg/day and when following their normal diet they consumed 2.5 g/kg/day. This investigation showed that the chronic consumption of a high protein diet (i.e., for 1 year) had no harmful effects on kidney or liver function. Furthermore, there were no alterations in clinical markers of metabolism and blood lipids.
Key points
* Multiple review articles indicate that no controlled scientific evidence exists indicating that increased intakes of protein pose any health risks in healthy, exercising individuals.
* Statements by large regulatory bodies have also indicated that concerns about ones health secondary to ingesting high amounts of protein are unfounded.
* A series of controlled investigations spanning up to one year in duration utilizing protein intakes of up to 2.53.3 g/kg/day in healthy resistance-trained individuals consistently indicate that increased intakes of protein exert no harmful effect on blood lipids or markers of kidney and liver function.

This is supported by a recent commentary [] which referenced recent reports from the World Health Organization [] where they indicated a lack of evidence linking a high protein diet to renal disease. Likewise, the panel charged with establishing reference nutrient values for Australia and New Zealand also stated there was no published evidence that elevated intakes of protein exerted any negative impact on kidney function in athletes or in general [].
* Recently, Antonio and colleagues published a series of original investigations that prescribed extremely high amounts of protein (~3.44.4 g/kg/day) and have consistently reported no harmful effects []. The first study in 2014 had resistance-trained individuals consume an extremely high protein diet (4.4 g/kg/day) for eight weeks and reported no change in adverse outcomes []. A follow-up investigation [] required participants to ingest up to 3.4 g/kg/day of protein for eight weeks while following a prescribed resistance training program and reported no changes in any of the blood parameters commonly used to assess clinical health (e.g., there was no effect on kidney or liver function). Their next study employed a crossover study design in twelve healthy resistance-trained men in which each participant was tested before and after for body composition as well as blood-markers of health and performance []. In one eight-week block, participants followed their normal (habitual) diet (2.6 g/kg/day) and in the other eight-week block, participants were prescribed to ingest greater than 3.0 g/kg/day resulting in an average protein intake of 2.9 g/kg/day over the entire 16-week study. No changes in body composition were reported, and importantly, no clinical side effects were observed throughout the study. Finally, the same group of authors published a one-year crossover study [] in fourteen healthy resistance-trained men. When prescribed to a high protein diet, the participants were instructed to ingest 3 g/kg/day and achieved an average intake of 3.3 g/kg/day and when following their normal diet they consumed 2.5 g/kg/day. This investigation showed that the chronic consumption of a high protein diet (i.e., for 1 year) had no harmful effects on kidney or liver function. Furthermore, there were no alterations in clinical markers of metabolism and blood lipids.
Key points
* Multiple review articles indicate that no controlled scientific evidence exists indicating that increased intakes of protein pose any health risks in healthy, exercising individuals.
* Statements by large regulatory bodies have also indicated that concerns about ones health secondary to ingesting high amounts of protein are unfounded.
* A series of controlled investigations spanning up to one year in duration utilizing protein intakes of up to 2.53.3 g/kg/day in healthy resistance-trained individuals consistently indicate that increased intakes of protein exert no harmful effect on blood lipids or markers of kidney and liver function.

International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand Protein and Exercise 2022 article Recommended intake
* Proteins provide the building blocks of all tissues via their constituent amino acids. Athletes consume dietary protein to repair and rebuild skeletal muscle and connective tissues following intense training bouts or athletic events. During in the 1980s and early 1990s Tarnopolsky [], Phillips [], and Lemon [] first demonstrated that total protein needs were 50 to 175% greater in athletes than sedentary controls. A report in 2004 by Phillips [] summarized the findings surrounding protein requirements in resistance-trained athletes. Using a regression approach, he concluded that a protein intake of 1.2 g of protein per kg of body weight per day (g/kg/day) should be recommended, and when the upper limit of a 95% confidence interval was included the amount approached 1.33 g/kg/day. A key consideration regarding these recommended values is that all generated data were obtained using the nitrogen balance technique, which is known to underestimate protein requirements. Interestingly, two of the included papers had prescribed protein intakes of 2.4 and 2.5 g/kg/day, respectively [, ]. All data points from these two studies also had the highest levels of positive nitrogen balance. For an athlete seeking to ensure an anabolic environment, higher daily protein intakes might be needed. Another challenge that underpins the ability to universally and successfully recommend daily protein amounts are factors related to the volume of the exercise program, age, body composition and training status of the athlete; as well as the total energy intake in the diet, particularly for athletes who desire to lose fat and are restricting calories to accomplish this goal []. For these reasons, and due to an increase of published studies in areas related to optimal protein dosing, timing and composition, protein needs are being recommended within this position stand on a per meal basis.
* For example, Moore [] found that muscle and albumin protein synthesis was optimized at approximately 20 g of egg protein at rest. Witard et al. [] provided incremental doses of whey protein (0, 10, 20 and 40 g) in conjunction with an acute bout of resistance exercise and concluded that a minimum protein dose of 20 g optimally promoted MPS rates. Finally, Yang and colleagues [] had 37 elderly men (average age of 71 years) consume incremental doses of whey protein isolate (0, 10, 20 and 40 g/dose) in combination with a single bout of lower body resistance exercise and concluded that a 40 g dose of whey protein isolate is needed in this population to maximize rates of MPS. Furthermore, while results from these studies offer indications of what optimal absolute dosing amounts may be, Phillips [] concluded that a relative dose of 0.25 g of protein per kg of body weight per dose might operate as an optimal supply of high-quality protein. Once a total daily target protein intake has been achieved, the frequency and pattern with which optimal doses are ingested may serve as a key determinant of overall changes in protein synthetic rates.
* Research indicates that rates of MPS rapidly rise to peak levels within 30 min of protein ingestion and are maintained for up to three hours before rapidly beginning to lower to basal rates of MPS even though amino acids are still elevated in the blood []. Using an oral ingestion model of 48 g of whey protein in healthy young men, rates of myofibrillar protein synthesis increased three-fold within 4590 min before slowly declining to basal rates of MPS all while plasma concentration of EAAs remained significantly elevated []. While human models have not fully explored the mechanistic basis of this muscle-full phenomenon, an energy deficit theory has been proposed which hypothesizes that rates of MPS were blunted even though plasma concentrations of amino acids remained elevated because a relative lack of cellular ATP was available to drive the synthetic process []. While largely unexplored in a human model, these authors relied upon an animal model and were able to reinstate increases in MPS using the consumption of leucine and carbohydrate 135 min after ingestion of the first meal. As such, it is suggested that individuals attempting to restrict caloric intake should consume three to four whole meals consisting of 2040 g of protein per meal. While this recommendation stems primarily from initial work that indicated protein doses of 2040 g favorably promote increased rates of MPS [, , ], Kim and colleagues [] recently reported that a 70 g dose of protein promoted a more favorable net balance of protein when compared to a 40 g dose due to a stronger attenuation of rates of muscle protein breakdown.
* For those attempting to increase their calories, we suggest consuming small snacks between meals consisting of both a complete protein and a carbohydrate source. This contention is supported by research from Paddon-Jones et al. [] that used a 28-day bed rest model. These researchers compared three 850-cal mixed macronutrient meals to three 850-cal meals combined with three 180-cal amino acid-carbohydrate snacks between meals. Results demonstrated that subjects, who also consumed the small snacks, experienced a 23% increase in muscle protein fractional synthesis and successful maintenance of strength throughout the bed rest trial. Additionally, using a protein distribution pattern of 2025 g doses every three hours in response to a single bout of lower body resistance exercise appears to promote the greatest increase in MPS rates and phosphorylation of key intramuscular proteins linked to muscle hypertrophy []. Finally, in a series of experiments, Arciero and colleagues [, ] employed a protein pacing strategy involving equitable distribution of effective doses of protein (46 meals/day of 2040 g per meal) alone and combined with multicomponent exercise training. Using this approach, their results consistently demonstrate positive changes in body composition [, ] and physical performance outcomes in both lean [, ] and overweight/obese populations [, , ]. This simple addition could provide benefits for individuals looking to increase muscle mass and improve body composition in general while also striving to maintain or improve health and performance.
Key points
* The current RDA for protein is 0.8 g/kg/day with multiple lines of evidence indicating this value is not an appropriate amount for a training athlete to meet their daily needs.
* While previous recommendations have suggested a daily intake of 1.21.3 g/kg/day is an appropriate amount, most of this work was completed using the nitrogen balance technique, which is known to systematically underestimate protein needs.
* Daily and per dose needs are combinations of many factors including volume of exercise, age, body composition, total energy intake and training status of the athlete.
* Daily intakes of 1.4 to 2.0 g/kg/day operate as a minimum recommended amount while greater amounts may be needed for people attempting to restrict energy intake while maintaining fat-free mass.
* Recommendations regarding the optimal protein intake per serving for athletes to maximize MPS are mixed and are dependent upon age and recent resistance exercise stimuli. General recommendations are 0.25 g of a high-quality protein per kg of body weight, or an absolute dose of 2040 g.
* Higher doses (~40 g) are likely needed to maximize MPS responses in elderly individuals.
* Even higher amounts (~70 g) appear to be necessary to promote attenuation of muscle protein breakdown.
* Pacing or spreading these feeding episodes approximately three hours apart has been consistently reported to promote sustained, increased levels of MPS and performance benefits.

* Proteins provide the building blocks of all tissues via their constituent amino acids. Athletes consume dietary protein to repair and rebuild skeletal muscle and connective tissues following intense training bouts or athletic events. During in the 1980s and early 1990s Tarnopolsky [], Phillips [], and Lemon [] first demonstrated that total protein needs were 50 to 175% greater in athletes than sedentary controls. A report in 2004 by Phillips [] summarized the findings surrounding protein requirements in resistance-trained athletes. Using a regression approach, he concluded that a protein intake of 1.2 g of protein per kg of body weight per day (g/kg/day) should be recommended, and when the upper limit of a 95% confidence interval was included the amount approached 1.33 g/kg/day. A key consideration regarding these recommended values is that all generated data were obtained using the nitrogen balance technique, which is known to underestimate protein requirements. Interestingly, two of the included papers had prescribed protein intakes of 2.4 and 2.5 g/kg/day, respectively [, ]. All data points from these two studies also had the highest levels of positive nitrogen balance.

Results demonstrated that subjects, who also consumed the small snacks, experienced a 23% increase in muscle protein fractional synthesis and successful maintenance of strength throughout the bed rest trial. Additionally, using a protein distribution pattern of 2025 g doses every three hours in response to a single bout of lower body resistance exercise appears to promote the greatest increase in MPS rates and phosphorylation of key intramuscular proteins linked to muscle hypertrophy []. Finally, in a series of experiments, Arciero and colleagues [, ] employed a protein pacing strategy involving equitable distribution of effective doses of protein (46 meals/day of 2040 g per meal) alone and combined with multicomponent exercise training. Using this approach, their results consistently demonstrate positive changes in body composition [, ] and physical performance outcomes in both lean [, ] and overweight/obese populations [, , ]. This simple addition could provide benefits for individuals looking to increase muscle mass and improve body composition in general while also striving to maintain or improve health and performance.
Key points
* The current RDA for protein is 0.8 g/kg/day with multiple lines of evidence indicating this value is not an appropriate amount for a training athlete to meet their daily needs.
* While previous recommendations have suggested a daily intake of 1.21.3 g/kg/day is an appropriate amount, most of this work was completed using the nitrogen balance technique, which is known to systematically underestimate protein needs.
* Daily and per dose needs are combinations of many factors including volume of exercise, age, body composition, total energy intake and training status of the athlete.
* Daily intakes of 1.4 to 2.0 g/kg/day operate as a minimum recommended amount while greater amounts may be needed for people attempting to restrict energy intake while maintaining fat-free mass.
* Recommendations regarding the optimal protein intake per serving for athletes to maximize MPS are mixed and are dependent upon age and recent resistance exercise stimuli. General recommendations are 0.25 g of a high-quality protein per kg of body weight, or an absolute dose of 2040 g.
* Higher doses (~40 g) are likely needed to maximize MPS responses in elderly individuals.
* Even higher amounts (~70 g) appear to be necessary to promote attenuation of muscle protein breakdown.
* Pacing or spreading these feeding episodes approximately three hours apart has been consistently reported to promote sustained, increased levels of MPS and performance benefits.

International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand Protein and Exercise 2022 article Recommended intake
* Proteins provide the building blocks of all tissues via their constituent amino acids. Athletes consume dietary protein to repair and rebuild skeletal muscle and connective tissues following intense training bouts or athletic events. During in the 1980s and early 1990s Tarnopolsky [], Phillips [], and Lemon [] first demonstrated that total protein needs were 50 to 175% greater in athletes than sedentary controls. A report in 2004 by Phillips [] summarized the findings surrounding protein requirements in resistance-trained athletes. Using a regression approach, he concluded that a protein intake of 1.2 g of protein per kg of body weight per day (g/kg/day) should be recommended, and when the upper limit of a 95% confidence interval was included the amount approached 1.33 g/kg/day. A key consideration regarding these recommended values is that all generated data were obtained using the nitrogen balance technique, which is known to underestimate protein requirements. Interestingly, two of the included papers had prescribed protein intakes of 2.4 and 2.5 g/kg/day, respectively [, ]. All data points from these two studies also had the highest levels of positive nitrogen balance. For an athlete seeking to ensure an anabolic environment, higher daily protein intakes might be needed. Another challenge that underpins the ability to universally and successfully recommend daily protein amounts are factors related to the volume of the exercise program, age, body composition and training status of the athlete; as well as the total energy intake in the diet, particularly for athletes who desire to lose fat and are restricting calories to accomplish this goal []. For these reasons, and due to an increase of published studies in areas related to optimal protein dosing, timing and composition, protein needs are being recommended within this position stand on a per meal basis.
* For example, Moore [] found that muscle and albumin protein synthesis was optimized at approximately 20 g of egg protein at rest. Witard et al. [] provided incremental doses of whey protein (0, 10, 20 and 40 g) in conjunction with an acute bout of resistance exercise and concluded that a minimum protein dose of 20 g optimally promoted MPS rates. Finally, Yang and colleagues [] had 37 elderly men (average age of 71 years) consume incremental doses of whey protein isolate (0, 10, 20 and 40 g/dose) in combination with a single bout of lower body resistance exercise and concluded that a 40 g dose of whey protein isolate is needed in this population to maximize rates of MPS. Furthermore, while results from these studies offer indications of what optimal absolute dosing amounts may be, Phillips [] concluded that a relative dose of 0.25 g of protein per kg of body weight per dose might operate as an optimal supply of high-quality protein. Once a total daily target protein intake has been achieved, the frequency and pattern with which optimal doses are ingested may serve as a key determinant of overall changes in protein synthetic rates.
* Research indicates that rates of MPS rapidly rise to peak levels within 30 min of protein ingestion and are maintained for up to three hours before rapidly beginning to lower to basal rates of MPS even though amino acids are still elevated in the blood []. Using an oral ingestion model of 48 g of whey protein in healthy young men, rates of myofibrillar protein synthesis increased three-fold within 4590 min before slowly declining to basal rates of MPS all while plasma concentration of EAAs remained significantly elevated []. While human models have not fully explored the mechanistic basis of this muscle-full phenomenon, an energy deficit theory has been proposed which hypothesizes that rates of MPS were blunted even though plasma concentrations of amino acids remained elevated because a relative lack of cellular ATP was available to drive the synthetic process []. While largely unexplored in a human model, these authors relied upon an animal model and were able to reinstate increases in MPS using the consumption of leucine and carbohydrate 135 min after ingestion of the first meal. As such, it is suggested that individuals attempting to restrict caloric intake should consume three to four whole meals consisting of 2040 g of protein per meal. While this recommendation stems primarily from initial work that indicated protein doses of 2040 g favorably promote increased rates of MPS [, , ], Kim and colleagues [] recently reported that a 70 g dose of protein promoted a more favorable net balance of protein when compared to a 40 g dose due to a stronger attenuation of rates of muscle protein breakdown.
* For those attempting to increase their calories, we suggest consuming small snacks between meals consisting of both a complete protein and a carbohydrate source. This contention is supported by research from Paddon-Jones et al. [] that used a 28-day bed rest model. These researchers compared three 850-cal mixed macronutrient meals to three 850-cal meals combined with three 180-cal amino acid-carbohydrate snacks between meals. Results demonstrated that subjects, who also consumed the small snacks, experienced a 23% increase in muscle protein fractional synthesis and successful maintenance of strength throughout the bed rest trial.

According to the International Society of Sports Nutrition, the current recommended daily intake of 0.8g/kg/day is not enough for training athletes. Instead, a daily intake of 1.4 to 2.0g/kg/day is recommended, with higher amounts needed for those restricting calories. Optimal protein intake per serving varies by age and recent exercise, but a general recommendation is 0.25g/kg of body weight or an absolute dose of 20-40g.

International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand Protein and Exercise 2022 article Recommended intake
* Proteins provide the building blocks of all tissues via their constituent amino acids. Athletes consume dietary protein to repair and rebuild skeletal muscle and connective tissues following intense training bouts or athletic events. During in the 1980s and early 1990s Tarnopolsky [], Phillips [], and Lemon [] first demonstrated that total protein needs were 50 to 175% greater in athletes than sedentary controls. A report in 2004 by Phillips [] summarized the findings surrounding protein requirements in resistance-trained athletes. Using a regression approach, he concluded that a protein intake of 1.2 g of protein per kg of body weight per day (g/kg/day) should be recommended, and when the upper limit of a 95% confidence interval was included the amount approached 1.33 g/kg/day. A key consideration regarding these recommended values is that all generated data were obtained using the nitrogen balance technique, which is known to underestimate protein requirements. Interestingly, two of the included papers had prescribed protein intakes of 2.4 and 2.5 g/kg/day, respectively [, ]. All data points from these two studies also had the highest levels of positive nitrogen balance. For an athlete seeking to ensure an anabolic environment, higher daily protein intakes might be needed. Another challenge that underpins the ability to universally and successfully recommend daily protein amounts are factors related to the volume of the exercise program, age, body composition and training status of the athlete; as well as the total energy intake in the diet, particularly for athletes who desire to lose fat and are restricting calories to accomplish this goal []. For these reasons, and due to an increase of published studies in areas related to optimal protein dosing, timing and composition, protein needs are being recommended within this position stand on a per meal basis.
* For example, Moore [] found that muscle and albumin protein synthesis was optimized at approximately 20 g of egg protein at rest. Witard et al. [] provided incremental doses of whey protein (0, 10, 20 and 40 g) in conjunction with an acute bout of resistance exercise and concluded that a minimum protein dose of 20 g optimally promoted MPS rates. Finally, Yang and colleagues [] had 37 elderly men (average age of 71 years) consume incremental doses of whey protein isolate (0, 10, 20 and 40 g/dose) in combination with a single bout of lower body resistance exercise and concluded that a 40 g dose of whey protein isolate is needed in this population to maximize rates of MPS. Furthermore, while results from these studies offer indications of what optimal absolute dosing amounts may be, Phillips [] concluded that a relative dose of 0.25 g of protein per kg of body weight per dose might operate as an optimal supply of high-quality protein. Once a total daily target protein intake has been achieved, the frequency and pattern with which optimal doses are ingested may serve as a key determinant of overall changes in protein synthetic rates.
* Research indicates that rates of MPS rapidly rise to peak levels within 30 min of protein ingestion and are maintained for up to three hours before rapidly beginning to lower to basal rates of MPS even though amino acids are still elevated in the blood []. Using an oral ingestion model of 48 g of whey protein in healthy young men, rates of myofibrillar protein synthesis increased three-fold within 4590 min before slowly declining to basal rates of MPS all while plasma concentration of EAAs remained significantly elevated []. While human models have not fully explored the mechanistic basis of this muscle-full phenomenon, an energy deficit theory has been proposed which hypothesizes that rates of MPS were blunted even though plasma concentrations of amino acids remained elevated because a relative lack of cellular ATP was available to drive the synthetic process []. While largely unexplored in a human model, these authors relied upon an animal model and were able to reinstate increases in MPS using the consumption of leucine and carbohydrate 135 min after ingestion of the first meal. As such, it is suggested that individuals attempting to restrict caloric intake should consume three to four whole meals consisting of 2040 g of protein per meal. While this recommendation stems primarily from initial work that indicated protein doses of 2040 g favorably promote increased rates of MPS [, , ], Kim and colleagues [] recently reported that a 70 g dose of protein promoted a more favorable net balance of protein when compared to a 40 g dose due to a stronger attenuation of rates of muscle protein breakdown.
* For those attempting to increase their calories, we suggest consuming small snacks between meals consisting of both a complete protein and a carbohydrate source. This contention is supported by research from Paddon-Jones et al. [] that used a 28-day bed rest model. These researchers compared three 850-cal mixed macronutrient meals to three 850-cal meals combined with three 180-cal amino acid-carbohydrate snacks between meals. Results demonstrated that subjects, who also consumed the small snacks, experienced a 23% increase in muscle protein fractional synthesis and successful maintenance of strength throughout the bed rest trial. Additionally, using a protein distribution pattern of 2025 g doses every three hours in response to a single bout of lower body resistance exercise appears to promote the greatest increase in MPS rates and phosphorylation of key intramuscular proteins linked to muscle hypertrophy []. Finally, in a series of experiments, Arciero and colleagues [, ] employed a protein pacing strategy involving equitable distribution of effective doses of protein (46 meals/day of 2040 g per meal) alone and combined with multicomponent exercise training. Using this approach, their results consistently demonstrate positive changes in body composition [, ] and physical performance outcomes in both lean [, ] and overweight/obese populations [, , ]. This simple addition could provide benefits for individuals looking to increase muscle mass and improve body composition in general while also striving to maintain or improve health and performance.
Key points
* The current RDA for protein is 0.8 g/kg/day with multiple lines of evidence indicating this value is not an appropriate amount for a training athlete to meet their daily needs.
* While previous recommendations have suggested a daily intake of 1.21.3 g/kg/day is an appropriate amount, most of this work was completed using the nitrogen balance technique, which is known to systematically underestimate protein needs.
* Daily and per dose needs are combinations of many factors including volume of exercise, age, body composition, total energy intake and training status of the athlete.
* Daily intakes of 1.4 to 2.0 g/kg/day operate as a minimum recommended amount while greater amounts may be needed for people attempting to restrict energy intake while maintaining fat-free mass.
* Recommendations regarding the optimal protein intake per serving for athletes to maximize MPS are mixed and are dependent upon age and recent resistance exercise stimuli. General recommendations are 0.25 g of a high-quality protein per kg of body weight, or an absolute dose of 2040 g.
* Higher doses (~40 g) are likely needed to maximize MPS responses in elderly individuals.
* Even higher amounts (~70 g) appear to be necessary to promote attenuation of muscle protein breakdown.
* Pacing or spreading these feeding episodes approximately three hours apart has been consistently reported to promote sustained, increased levels of MPS and performance benefits.

This is because the previous recommendations were based on the nitrogen balance technique which underestimated protein needs. Now, it's recommended that athletes consume a minimum of 1.4 to 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight per day. 

To maximize muscle protein synthesis, athletes should aim for 0.25 grams of high-quality protein per kilogram of body weight, or an absolute dose of 20-40 grams per serving. For elderly athletes, even higher doses (~40 grams) are likely needed to maximize muscle protein synthesis responses and higher amounts (~70 grams) are necessary to promote attenuation of muscle protein breakdown. 

It's not just about the total daily protein intake, but also about the distribution of protein throughout the day.

The current recommendation for athletes is to consume a minimum of 1.4 to 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight per day. This is because the previous recommendations were based on the nitrogen balance technique which underestimated protein needs.

International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand Protein and Exercise 2022 article Recommended intake
* Proteins provide the building blocks of all tissues via their constituent amino acids. Athletes consume dietary protein to repair and rebuild skeletal muscle and connective tissues following intense training bouts or athletic events. During in the 1980s and early 1990s Tarnopolsky [], Phillips [], and Lemon [] first demonstrated that total protein needs were 50 to 175% greater in athletes than sedentary controls. A report in 2004 by Phillips [] summarized the findings surrounding protein requirements in resistance-trained athletes. Using a regression approach, he concluded that a protein intake of 1.2 g of protein per kg of body weight per day (g/kg/day) should be recommended, and when the upper limit of a 95% confidence interval was included the amount approached 1.33 g/kg/day. A key consideration regarding these recommended values is that all generated data were obtained using the nitrogen balance technique, which is known to underestimate protein requirements. Interestingly, two of the included papers had prescribed protein intakes of 2.4 and 2.5 g/kg/day, respectively [, ]. All data points from these two studies also had the highest levels of positive nitrogen balance. For an athlete seeking to ensure an anabolic environment, higher daily protein intakes might be needed. Another challenge that underpins the ability to universally and successfully recommend daily protein amounts are factors related to the volume of the exercise program, age, body composition and training status of the athlete; as well as the total energy intake in the diet, particularly for athletes who desire to lose fat and are restricting calories to accomplish this goal []. For these reasons, and due to an increase of published studies in areas related to optimal protein dosing, timing and composition, protein needs are being recommended within this position stand on a per meal basis.
* For example, Moore [] found that muscle and albumin protein synthesis was optimized at approximately 20 g of egg protein at rest. Witard et al. [] provided incremental doses of whey protein (0, 10, 20 and 40 g) in conjunction with an acute bout of resistance exercise and concluded that a minimum protein dose of 20 g optimally promoted MPS rates. Finally, Yang and colleagues [] had 37 elderly men (average age of 71 years) consume incremental doses of whey protein isolate (0, 10, 20 and 40 g/dose) in combination with a single bout of lower body resistance exercise and concluded that a 40 g dose of whey protein isolate is needed in this population to maximize rates of MPS. Furthermore, while results from these studies offer indications of what optimal absolute dosing amounts may be, Phillips [] concluded that a relative dose of 0.25 g of protein per kg of body weight per dose might operate as an optimal supply of high-quality protein. Once a total daily target protein intake has been achieved, the frequency and pattern with which optimal doses are ingested may serve as a key determinant of overall changes in protein synthetic rates.
* Research indicates that rates of MPS rapidly rise to peak levels within 30 min of protein ingestion and are maintained for up to three hours before rapidly beginning to lower to basal rates of MPS even though amino acids are still elevated in the blood []. Using an oral ingestion model of 48 g of whey protein in healthy young men, rates of myofibrillar protein synthesis increased three-fold within 4590 min before slowly declining to basal rates of MPS all while plasma concentration of EAAs remained significantly elevated []. While human models have not fully explored the mechanistic basis of this muscle-full phenomenon, an energy deficit theory has been proposed which hypothesizes that rates of MPS were blunted even though plasma concentrations of amino acids remained elevated because a relative lack of cellular ATP was available to drive the synthetic process []. While largely unexplored in a human model, these authors relied upon an animal model and were able to reinstate increases in MPS using the consumption of leucine and carbohydrate 135 min after ingestion of the first meal. As such, it is suggested that individuals attempting to restrict caloric intake should consume three to four whole meals consisting of 2040 g of protein per meal. While this recommendation stems primarily from initial work that indicated protein doses of 2040 g favorably promote increased rates of MPS [, , ], Kim and colleagues [] recently reported that a 70 g dose of protein promoted a more favorable net balance of protein when compared to a 40 g dose due to a stronger attenuation of rates of muscle protein breakdown.
* For those attempting to increase their calories, we suggest consuming small snacks between meals consisting of both a complete protein and a carbohydrate source. This contention is supported by research from Paddon-Jones et al. [] that used a 28-day bed rest model. These researchers compared three 850-cal mixed macronutrient meals to three 850-cal meals combined with three 180-cal amino acid-carbohydrate snacks between meals. Results demonstrated that subjects, who also consumed the small snacks, experienced a 23% increase in muscle protein fractional synthesis and successful maintenance of strength throughout the bed rest trial. Additionally, using a protein distribution pattern of 2025 g doses every three hours in response to a single bout of lower body resistance exercise appears to promote the greatest increase in MPS rates and phosphorylation of key intramuscular proteins linked to muscle hypertrophy []. Finally, in a series of experiments, Arciero and colleagues [, ] employed a protein pacing strategy involving equitable distribution of effective doses of protein (46 meals/day of 2040 g per meal) alone and combined with multicomponent exercise training. Using this approach, their results consistently demonstrate positive changes in body composition [, ] and physical performance outcomes in both lean [, ] and overweight/obese populations [, , ]. This simple addition could provide benefits for individuals looking to increase muscle mass and improve body composition in general while also striving to maintain or improve health and performance.
Key points
* The current RDA for protein is 0.8 g/kg/day with multiple lines of evidence indicating this value is not an appropriate amount for a training athlete to meet their daily needs.
* While previous recommendations have suggested a daily intake of 1.21.3 g/kg/day is an appropriate amount, most of this work was completed using the nitrogen balance technique, which is known to systematically underestimate protein needs.
* Daily and per dose needs are combinations of many factors including volume of exercise, age, body composition, total energy intake and training status of the athlete.
* Daily intakes of 1.4 to 2.0 g/kg/day operate as a minimum recommended amount while greater amounts may be needed for people attempting to restrict energy intake while maintaining fat-free mass.
* Recommendations regarding the optimal protein intake per serving for athletes to maximize MPS are mixed and are dependent upon age and recent resistance exercise stimuli. General recommendations are 0.25 g of a high-quality protein per kg of body weight, or an absolute dose of 2040 g.
* Higher doses (~40 g) are likely needed to maximize MPS responses in elderly individuals.
* Even higher amounts (~70 g) appear to be necessary to promote attenuation of muscle protein breakdown.
* Pacing or spreading these feeding episodes approximately three hours apart has been consistently reported to promote sustained, increased levels of MPS and performance benefits.

International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand Protein and Exercise 2022 article Recommended intake
* Proteins provide the building blocks of all tissues via their constituent amino acids. Athletes consume dietary protein to repair and rebuild skeletal muscle and connective tissues following intense training bouts or athletic events. During in the 1980s and early 1990s Tarnopolsky [], Phillips [], and Lemon [] first demonstrated that total protein needs were 50 to 175% greater in athletes than sedentary controls. A report in 2004 by Phillips [] summarized the findings surrounding protein requirements in resistance-trained athletes. Using a regression approach, he concluded that a protein intake of 1.2 g of protein per kg of body weight per day (g/kg/day) should be recommended, and when the upper limit of a 95% confidence interval was included the amount approached 1.33 g/kg/day. A key consideration regarding these recommended values is that all generated data were obtained using the nitrogen balance technique, which is known to underestimate protein requirements. Interestingly, two of the included papers had prescribed protein intakes of 2.4 and 2.5 g/kg/day, respectively [, ]. All data points from these two studies also had the highest levels of positive nitrogen balance. For an athlete seeking to ensure an anabolic environment, higher daily protein intakes might be needed. Another challenge that underpins the ability to universally and successfully recommend daily protein amounts are factors related to the volume of the exercise program, age, body composition and training status of the athlete; as well as the total energy intake in the diet, particularly for athletes who desire to lose fat and are restricting calories to accomplish this goal []. For these reasons, and due to an increase of published studies in areas related to optimal protein dosing, timing and composition, protein needs are being recommended within this position stand on a per meal basis.
* For example, Moore [] found that muscle and albumin protein synthesis was optimized at approximately 20 g of egg protein at rest. Witard et al. [] provided incremental doses of whey protein (0, 10, 20 and 40 g) in conjunction with an acute bout of resistance exercise and concluded that a minimum protein dose of 20 g optimally promoted MPS rates. Finally, Yang and colleagues [] had 37 elderly men (average age of 71 years) consume incremental doses of whey protein isolate (0, 10, 20 and 40 g/dose) in combination with a single bout of lower body resistance exercise and concluded that a 40 g dose of whey protein isolate is needed in this population to maximize rates of MPS. Furthermore, while results from these studies offer indications of what optimal absolute dosing amounts may be, Phillips [] concluded that a relative dose of 0.25 g of protein per kg of body weight per dose might operate as an optimal supply of high-quality protein. Once a total daily target protein intake has been achieved, the frequency and pattern with which optimal doses are ingested may serve as a key determinant of overall changes in protein synthetic rates.
* Research indicates that rates of MPS rapidly rise to peak levels within 30 min of protein ingestion and are maintained for up to three hours before rapidly beginning to lower to basal rates of MPS even though amino acids are still elevated in the blood []. Using an oral ingestion model of 48 g of whey protein in healthy young men, rates of myofibrillar protein synthesis increased three-fold within 4590 min before slowly declining to basal rates of MPS all while plasma concentration of EAAs remained significantly elevated []. While human models have not fully explored the mechanistic basis of this muscle-full phenomenon, an energy deficit theory has been proposed which hypothesizes that rates of MPS were blunted even though plasma concentrations of amino acids remained elevated because a relative lack of cellular ATP was available to drive the synthetic process []. While largely unexplored in a human model, these authors relied upon an animal model and were able to reinstate increases in MPS using the consumption of leucine and carbohydrate 135 min after ingestion of the first meal. As such, it is suggested that individuals attempting to restrict caloric intake should consume three to four whole meals consisting of 2040 g of protein per meal. While this recommendation stems primarily from initial work that indicated protein doses of 2040 g favorably promote increased rates of MPS [, , ], Kim and colleagues [] recently reported that a 70 g dose of protein promoted a more favorable net balance of protein when compared to a 40 g dose due to a stronger attenuation of rates of muscle protein breakdown.
* For those attempting to increase their calories, we suggest consuming small snacks between meals consisting of both a complete protein and a carbohydrate source. This contention is supported by research from Paddon-Jones et al. [] that used a 28-day bed rest model. These researchers compared three 850-cal mixed macronutrient meals to three 850-cal meals combined with three 180-cal amino acid-carbohydrate snacks between meals. Results demonstrated that subjects, who also consumed the small snacks, experienced a 23% increase in muscle protein fractional synthesis and successful maintenance of strength throughout the bed rest trial. Additionally, using a protein distribution pattern of 2025 g doses every three hours in response to a single bout of lower body resistance exercise appears to promote the greatest increase in MPS rates and phosphorylation of key intramuscular proteins linked to muscle hypertrophy []. Finally, in a series of experiments, Arciero and colleagues [, ] employed a protein pacing strategy involving equitable distribution of effective doses of protein (46 meals/day of 2040 g per meal) alone and combined with multicomponent exercise training. Using this approach, their results consistently demonstrate positive changes in body composition [, ] and physical performance outcomes in both lean [, ] and overweight/obese populations [, , ]. This simple addition could provide benefits for individuals looking to increase muscle mass and improve body composition in general while also striving to maintain or improve health and performance.
Key points
* The current RDA for protein is 0.8 g/kg/day with multiple lines of evidence indicating this value is not an appropriate amount for a training athlete to meet their daily needs.
* While previous recommendations have suggested a daily intake of 1.21.3 g/kg/day is an appropriate amount, most of this work was completed using the nitrogen balance technique, which is known to systematically underestimate protein needs.
* Daily and per dose needs are combinations of many factors including volume of exercise, age, body composition, total energy intake and training status of the athlete.
* Daily intakes of 1.4 to 2.0 g/kg/day operate as a minimum recommended amount while greater amounts may be needed for people attempting to restrict energy intake while maintaining fat-free mass.
* Recommendations regarding the optimal protein intake per serving for athletes to maximize MPS are mixed and are dependent upon age and recent resistance exercise stimuli. General recommendations are 0.25 g of a high-quality protein per kg of body weight, or an absolute dose of 2040 g.
* Higher doses (~40 g) are likely needed to maximize MPS responses in elderly individuals.
* Even higher amounts (~70 g) appear to be necessary to promote attenuation of muscle protein breakdown.
* Pacing or spreading these feeding episodes approximately three hours apart has been consistently reported to promote sustained, increased levels of MPS and performance benefits.

Your audience consists of seniors","Are you a senior looking to maintain your muscle mass and overall health? According to the International Society of Sports Nutrition, the current recommended daily protein intake may not be enough for athletes, and even higher amounts are needed for elderly individuals to promote muscle protein synthesis and prevent muscle breakdown. To optimize muscle growth, it is recommended to consume 0.25 g/kg of body weight or an absolute dose of 20-40 g of protein per serving, and to pace feeding episodes every three hours. By following these guidelines, seniors can maintain their muscle mass and overall health. #sportsnutrition #proteinintake #musclebuilding #seniorhealth"

International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand Protein and Exercise 2022 article Recommended intake
* Proteins provide the building blocks of all tissues via their constituent amino acids. Athletes consume dietary protein to repair and rebuild skeletal muscle and connective tissues following intense training bouts or athletic events. During in the 1980s and early 1990s Tarnopolsky [], Phillips [], and Lemon [] first demonstrated that total protein needs were 50 to 175% greater in athletes than sedentary controls. A report in 2004 by Phillips [] summarized the findings surrounding protein requirements in resistance-trained athletes. Using a regression approach, he concluded that a protein intake of 1.2 g of protein per kg of body weight per day (g/kg/day) should be recommended, and when the upper limit of a 95% confidence interval was included the amount approached 1.33 g/kg/day. A key consideration regarding these recommended values is that all generated data were obtained using the nitrogen balance technique, which is known to underestimate protein requirements. Interestingly, two of the included papers had prescribed protein intakes of 2.4 and 2.5 g/kg/day, respectively [, ]. All data points from these two studies also had the highest levels of positive nitrogen balance. For an athlete seeking to ensure an anabolic environment, higher daily protein intakes might be needed. Another challenge that underpins the ability to universally and successfully recommend daily protein amounts are factors related to the volume of the exercise program, age, body composition and training status of the athlete; as well as the total energy intake in the diet, particularly for athletes who desire to lose fat and are restricting calories to accomplish this goal []. For these reasons, and due to an increase of published studies in areas related to optimal protein dosing, timing and composition, protein needs are being recommended within this position stand on a per meal basis.
* For example, Moore [] found that muscle and albumin protein synthesis was optimized at approximately 20 g of egg protein at rest. Witard et al. [] provided incremental doses of whey protein (0, 10, 20 and 40 g) in conjunction with an acute bout of resistance exercise and concluded that a minimum protein dose of 20 g optimally promoted MPS rates. Finally, Yang and colleagues [] had 37 elderly men (average age of 71 years) consume incremental doses of whey protein isolate (0, 10, 20 and 40 g/dose) in combination with a single bout of lower body resistance exercise and concluded that a 40 g dose of whey protein isolate is needed in this population to maximize rates of MPS. Furthermore, while results from these studies offer indications of what optimal absolute dosing amounts may be, Phillips [] concluded that a relative dose of 0.25 g of protein per kg of body weight per dose might operate as an optimal supply of high-quality protein. Once a total daily target protein intake has been achieved, the frequency and pattern with which optimal doses are ingested may serve as a key determinant of overall changes in protein synthetic rates.
* Research indicates that rates of MPS rapidly rise to peak levels within 30 min of protein ingestion and are maintained for up to three hours before rapidly beginning to lower to basal rates of MPS even though amino acids are still elevated in the blood []. Using an oral ingestion model of 48 g of whey protein in healthy young men, rates of myofibrillar protein synthesis increased three-fold within 4590 min before slowly declining to basal rates of MPS all while plasma concentration of EAAs remained significantly elevated []. While human models have not fully explored the mechanistic basis of this muscle-full phenomenon, an energy deficit theory has been proposed which hypothesizes that rates of MPS were blunted even though plasma concentrations of amino acids remained elevated because a relative lack of cellular ATP was available to drive the synthetic process []. While largely unexplored in a human model, these authors relied upon an animal model and were able to reinstate increases in MPS using the consumption of leucine and carbohydrate 135 min after ingestion of the first meal. As such, it is suggested that individuals attempting to restrict caloric intake should consume three to four whole meals consisting of 2040 g of protein per meal. While this recommendation stems primarily from initial work that indicated protein doses of 2040 g favorably promote increased rates of MPS [, , ], Kim and colleagues [] recently reported that a 70 g dose of protein promoted a more favorable net balance of protein when compared to a 40 g dose due to a stronger attenuation of rates of muscle protein breakdown.
* For those attempting to increase their calories, we suggest consuming small snacks between meals consisting of both a complete protein and a carbohydrate source. This contention is supported by research from Paddon-Jones et al. [] that used a 28-day bed rest model. These researchers compared three 850-cal mixed macronutrient meals to three 850-cal meals combined with three 180-cal amino acid-carbohydrate snacks between meals. Results demonstrated that subjects, who also consumed the small snacks, experienced a 23% increase in muscle protein fractional synthesis and successful maintenance of strength throughout the bed rest trial. Additionally, using a protein distribution pattern of 2025 g doses every three hours in response to a single bout of lower body resistance exercise appears to promote the greatest increase in MPS rates and phosphorylation of key intramuscular proteins linked to muscle hypertrophy []. Finally, in a series of experiments, Arciero and colleagues [, ] employed a protein pacing strategy involving equitable distribution of effective doses of protein (46 meals/day of 2040 g per meal) alone and combined with multicomponent exercise training. Using this approach, their results consistently demonstrate positive changes in body composition [, ] and physical performance outcomes in both lean [, ] and overweight/obese populations [, , ]. This simple addition could provide benefits for individuals looking to increase muscle mass and improve body composition in general while also striving to maintain or improve health and performance.
Key points
* The current RDA for protein is 0.8 g/kg/day with multiple lines of evidence indicating this value is not an appropriate amount for a training athlete to meet their daily needs.
* While previous recommendations have suggested a daily intake of 1.21.3 g/kg/day is an appropriate amount, most of this work was completed using the nitrogen balance technique, which is known to systematically underestimate protein needs.
* Daily and per dose needs are combinations of many factors including volume of exercise, age, body composition, total energy intake and training status of the athlete.
* Daily intakes of 1.4 to 2.0 g/kg/day operate as a minimum recommended amount while greater amounts may be needed for people attempting to restrict energy intake while maintaining fat-free mass.
* Recommendations regarding the optimal protein intake per serving for athletes to maximize MPS are mixed and are dependent upon age and recent resistance exercise stimuli. General recommendations are 0.25 g of a high-quality protein per kg of body weight, or an absolute dose of 2040 g.
* Higher doses (~40 g) are likely needed to maximize MPS responses in elderly individuals.
* Even higher amounts (~70 g) appear to be necessary to promote attenuation of muscle protein breakdown.
* Pacing or spreading these feeding episodes approximately three hours apart has been consistently reported to promote sustained, increased levels of MPS and performance benefits.

Elderly individuals may need higher doses of protein (~40 grams) to maximize muscle protein synthesis. Spreading out protein intake into 3-4 meals per day, each consisting of 20-40 grams of protein, has been shown to promote sustained increases in muscle protein synthesis and performance benefits. Remember, protein needs are dependent on factors such as exercise volume, age, body composition, and total energy intake. Consult a sports nutrition expert to determine the best protein intake for your individual needs!"

International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand Protein and Exercise 2022 article Recommended intake
* Proteins provide the building blocks of all tissues via their constituent amino acids. Athletes consume dietary protein to repair and rebuild skeletal muscle and connective tissues following intense training bouts or athletic events. During in the 1980s and early 1990s Tarnopolsky [], Phillips [], and Lemon [] first demonstrated that total protein needs were 50 to 175% greater in athletes than sedentary controls. A report in 2004 by Phillips [] summarized the findings surrounding protein requirements in resistance-trained athletes. Using a regression approach, he concluded that a protein intake of 1.2 g of protein per kg of body weight per day (g/kg/day) should be recommended, and when the upper limit of a 95% confidence interval was included the amount approached 1.33 g/kg/day. A key consideration regarding these recommended values is that all generated data were obtained using the nitrogen balance technique, which is known to underestimate protein requirements. Interestingly, two of the included papers had prescribed protein intakes of 2.4 and 2.5 g/kg/day, respectively [, ]. All data points from these two studies also had the highest levels of positive nitrogen balance. For an athlete seeking to ensure an anabolic environment, higher daily protein intakes might be needed. Another challenge that underpins the ability to universally and successfully recommend daily protein amounts are factors related to the volume of the exercise program, age, body composition and training status of the athlete; as well as the total energy intake in the diet, particularly for athletes who desire to lose fat and are restricting calories to accomplish this goal []. For these reasons, and due to an increase of published studies in areas related to optimal protein dosing, timing and composition, protein needs are being recommended within this position stand on a per meal basis.
* For example, Moore [] found that muscle and albumin protein synthesis was optimized at approximately 20 g of egg protein at rest. Witard et al. [] provided incremental doses of whey protein (0, 10, 20 and 40 g) in conjunction with an acute bout of resistance exercise and concluded that a minimum protein dose of 20 g optimally promoted MPS rates. Finally, Yang and colleagues [] had 37 elderly men (average age of 71 years) consume incremental doses of whey protein isolate (0, 10, 20 and 40 g/dose) in combination with a single bout of lower body resistance exercise and concluded that a 40 g dose of whey protein isolate is needed in this population to maximize rates of MPS. Furthermore, while results from these studies offer indications of what optimal absolute dosing amounts may be, Phillips [] concluded that a relative dose of 0.25 g of protein per kg of body weight per dose might operate as an optimal supply of high-quality protein. Once a total daily target protein intake has been achieved, the frequency and pattern with which optimal doses are ingested may serve as a key determinant of overall changes in protein synthetic rates.
* Research indicates that rates of MPS rapidly rise to peak levels within 30 min of protein ingestion and are maintained for up to three hours before rapidly beginning to lower to basal rates of MPS even though amino acids are still elevated in the blood []. Using an oral ingestion model of 48 g of whey protein in healthy young men, rates of myofibrillar protein synthesis increased three-fold within 4590 min before slowly declining to basal rates of MPS all while plasma concentration of EAAs remained significantly elevated []. While human models have not fully explored the mechanistic basis of this muscle-full phenomenon, an energy deficit theory has been proposed which hypothesizes that rates of MPS were blunted even though plasma concentrations of amino acids remained elevated because a relative lack of cellular ATP was available to drive the synthetic process []. While largely unexplored in a human model, these authors relied upon an animal model and were able to reinstate increases in MPS using the consumption of leucine and carbohydrate 135 min after ingestion of the first meal. As such, it is suggested that individuals attempting to restrict caloric intake should consume three to four whole meals consisting of 2040 g of protein per meal. While this recommendation stems primarily from initial work that indicated protein doses of 2040 g favorably promote increased rates of MPS [, , ], Kim and colleagues [] recently reported that a 70 g dose of protein promoted a more favorable net balance of protein when compared to a 40 g dose due to a stronger attenuation of rates of muscle protein breakdown.
* For those attempting to increase their calories, we suggest consuming small snacks between meals consisting of both a complete protein and a carbohydrate source. This contention is supported by research from Paddon-Jones et al. [] that used a 28-day bed rest model. These researchers compared three 850-cal mixed macronutrient meals to three 850-cal meals combined with three 180-cal amino acid-carbohydrate snacks between meals. Results demonstrated that subjects, who also consumed the small snacks, experienced a 23% increase in muscle protein fractional synthesis and successful maintenance of strength throughout the bed rest trial. Additionally, using a protein distribution pattern of 2025 g doses every three hours in response to a single bout of lower body resistance exercise appears to promote the greatest increase in MPS rates and phosphorylation of key intramuscular proteins linked to muscle hypertrophy []. Finally, in a series of experiments, Arciero and colleagues [, ] employed a protein pacing strategy involving equitable distribution of effective doses of protein (46 meals/day of 2040 g per meal) alone and combined with multicomponent exercise training. Using this approach, their results consistently demonstrate positive changes in body composition [, ] and physical performance outcomes in both lean [, ] and overweight/obese populations [, , ]. This simple addition could provide benefits for individuals looking to increase muscle mass and improve body composition in general while also striving to maintain or improve health and performance.
Key points
* The current RDA for protein is 0.8 g/kg/day with multiple lines of evidence indicating this value is not an appropriate amount for a training athlete to meet their daily needs.
* While previous recommendations have suggested a daily intake of 1.21.3 g/kg/day is an appropriate amount, most of this work was completed using the nitrogen balance technique, which is known to systematically underestimate protein needs.
* Daily and per dose needs are combinations of many factors including volume of exercise, age, body composition, total energy intake and training status of the athlete.
* Daily intakes of 1.4 to 2.0 g/kg/day operate as a minimum recommended amount while greater amounts may be needed for people attempting to restrict energy intake while maintaining fat-free mass.
* Recommendations regarding the optimal protein intake per serving for athletes to maximize MPS are mixed and are dependent upon age and recent resistance exercise stimuli. General recommendations are 0.25 g of a high-quality protein per kg of body weight, or an absolute dose of 2040 g.
* Higher doses (~40 g) are likely needed to maximize MPS responses in elderly individuals.
* Even higher amounts (~70 g) appear to be necessary to promote attenuation of muscle protein breakdown.
* Pacing or spreading these feeding episodes approximately three hours apart has been consistently reported to promote sustained, increased levels of MPS and performance benefits.

* Improving ones body composition through the loss of fat mass and increasing fat-free mass is often associated with improvements in physical performance. In this respect, many published investigations report that protein supplementation results in significant improvements in lean body weight/cross-sectional areas as compared to placebo treatments [, , , , , , ]. Andersen et al. [] examined 22 healthy men that completed a 14-week resistance-training program (3 days/week consisting of 34 sets of lower body exercises) while supplementing with either 25 g of a high-quality protein blend or 25 g of carbohydrate. When the blend of milk proteins was provided, significantly greater increases in fat-free mass, muscle cross-sectional area in both the Type I and Type II muscle fibers occurred when compared to changes seen with carbohydrate consumption. Collectively, a meta-analysis by Cermak and colleagues [] reported a mean increase in fat-free mass of 0.69 kg (95% Confidence Interval: 0.470.91 kg) when protein supplementation was provided versus a placebo during a resistance-training program. Other reviews by Tipton, Phillips and Pasiakos, respectively, [, , ] provide further support that protein supplementation (1525 g over 414 weeks) augments lean mass accretion when combined with completion of a resistance training program.
* Beyond accretion of fat-free mass, increasing daily protein intake through a combination of food and supplementation to levels above the recommended daily allowance (RDA) (RDA 0.8 g/kg/day, increasing to 1.22.4 g/kg/day for the endurance and strength/power athletes) while restricting energy intake (3040% reduction in energy intake) has been demonstrated to maximize the loss of fat tissue while also promoting the maintenance of fat-free mass []. The majority of this work has been conducted using overweight and obese individuals who were prescribed an energy-restricted diet that delivered a greater ratio of protein relative to carbohydrate. As a classic example, Layman and investigators [] randomized obese women to consume one of two restricted energy diets (16001700 kcals/day) that were either higher in carbohydrates (>3.5: carbohydrate-to-protein ratio) or protein (<1.5: carbohydrate-to-protein ratio). Groups were further divided into those that followed a five-day per week exercise program (walking + resistance training, 2050 min/workout) and a control group that performed light walking of less than 100 min per week. Greater amounts of fat were lost when higher amounts of protein were ingested, but even greater amounts of fat loss occurred when the exercise program was added to the high-protein diet group, resulting in significant decreases in body fat. Using an active population that ranged from normal weight to overweight (BMI: 2229 kg/m2), Pasiakos and colleagues [] examined the impact of progressively increasing dietary protein over a 21-day study period. An aggressive energy reduction model was employed that resulted in each participant reducing their caloric intake by 30% and increasing their energy expenditure by 10%. Each person was randomly assigned to consume a diet that contained either 1× (0.8 g/kg), 2× (1.6 g/kg) or 3× (2.4 g/kg) the RDA for protein. Participants were measured for changes in body weight and body composition. While the greatest body weight loss occurred in the 1× RDA group, this group also lost the highest percentage of fat-free mass and lowest percentage of fat mass. The 2× and 3× RDA groups lost significant amounts of body weight that consisted of 70% and 64% fat mass, respectively.
* Collectively, these results indicate that increasing dietary protein can promote favorable adaptations in body composition through the promotion of fat-free mass accretion when combined with a hyperenergetic diet and a heavy resistance training program and can also promote the loss of fat mass when higher intakes of daily protein (2-3× the RDA) are combined with an exercise program and a hypoenergetic diet.
Key points:
* When combined with a hyperenergetic diet and a heavy resistance-training program, protein supplementation may promote increases in skeletal muscle cross-sectional area and lean body mass.
* When combined with a resistance-training program and a hypoenergetic diet, an elevated daily intake of protein (2  3× the RDA) can promote greater losses of fat mass and greater overall improvements in body composition.

* Improving ones body composition through the loss of fat mass and increasing fat-free mass is often associated with improvements in physical performance. In this respect, many published investigations report that protein supplementation results in significant improvements in lean body weight/cross-sectional areas as compared to placebo treatments [, , , , , , ]. Andersen et al. [] examined 22 healthy men that completed a 14-week resistance-training program (3 days/week consisting of 34 sets of lower body exercises) while supplementing with either 25 g of a high-quality protein blend or 25 g of carbohydrate. When the blend of milk proteins was provided, significantly greater increases in fat-free mass, muscle cross-sectional area in both the Type I and Type II muscle fibers occurred when compared to changes seen with carbohydrate consumption. Collectively, a meta-analysis by Cermak and colleagues [] reported a mean increase in fat-free mass of 0.69 kg (95% Confidence Interval: 0.470.91 kg) when protein supplementation was provided versus a placebo during a resistance-training program. Other reviews by Tipton, Phillips and Pasiakos, respectively, [, , ] provide further support that protein supplementation (1525 g over 414 weeks) augments lean mass accretion when combined with completion of a resistance training program.
* Beyond accretion of fat-free mass, increasing daily protein intake through a combination of food and supplementation to levels above the recommended daily allowance (RDA) (RDA 0.8 g/kg/day, increasing to 1.22.4 g/kg/day for the endurance and strength/power athletes) while restricting energy intake (3040% reduction in energy intake) has been demonstrated to maximize the loss of fat tissue while also promoting the maintenance of fat-free mass [].

Your audience consists of seniors","Maximize the benefits of your workouts with protein supplementation! A recent study found that adding protein to your diet during resistance training can increase muscle mass by 0.69 kg on average. Additionally, increasing your daily protein intake to 2-3 times the recommended daily allowance can promote greater fat loss and improved body composition. This information is especially relevant for seniors who want to maintain their muscle mass and overall health as they age. Remember to combine protein supplementation with a heavy resistance-training program and a healthy diet for optimal results. #sportsnutrition #protein #fitness"

* Improving ones body composition through the loss of fat mass and increasing fat-free mass is often associated with improvements in physical performance. In this respect, many published investigations report that protein supplementation results in significant improvements in lean body weight/cross-sectional areas as compared to placebo treatments [, , , , , , ]. Andersen et al. [] examined 22 healthy men that completed a 14-week resistance-training program (3 days/week consisting of 34 sets of lower body exercises) while supplementing with either 25 g of a high-quality protein blend or 25 g of carbohydrate. When the blend of milk proteins was provided, significantly greater increases in fat-free mass, muscle cross-sectional area in both the Type I and Type II muscle fibers occurred when compared to changes seen with carbohydrate consumption. Collectively, a meta-analysis by Cermak and colleagues [] reported a mean increase in fat-free mass of 0.69 kg (95% Confidence Interval: 0.470.91 kg) when protein supplementation was provided versus a placebo during a resistance-training program. Other reviews by Tipton, Phillips and Pasiakos, respectively, [, , ] provide further support that protein supplementation (1525 g over 414 weeks) augments lean mass accretion when combined with completion of a resistance training program.
* Beyond accretion of fat-free mass, increasing daily protein intake through a combination of food and supplementation to levels above the recommended daily allowance (RDA) (RDA 0.8 g/kg/day, increasing to 1.22.4 g/kg/day for the endurance and strength/power athletes) while restricting energy intake (3040% reduction in energy intake) has been demonstrated to maximize the loss of fat tissue while also promoting the maintenance of fat-free mass []. The majority of this work has been conducted using overweight and obese individuals who were prescribed an energy-restricted diet that delivered a greater ratio of protein relative to carbohydrate. As a classic example, Layman and investigators [] randomized obese women to consume one of two restricted energy diets (16001700 kcals/day) that were either higher in carbohydrates (>3.5: carbohydrate-to-protein ratio) or protein (<1.5: carbohydrate-to-protein ratio). Groups were further divided into those that followed a five-day per week exercise program (walking + resistance training, 2050 min/workout) and a control group that performed light walking of less than 100 min per week. Greater amounts of fat were lost when higher amounts of protein were ingested, but even greater amounts of fat loss occurred when the exercise program was added to the high-protein diet group, resulting in significant decreases in body fat. Using an active population that ranged from normal weight to overweight (BMI: 2229 kg/m2), Pasiakos and colleagues [] examined the impact of progressively increasing dietary protein over a 21-day study period. An aggressive energy reduction model was employed that resulted in each participant reducing their caloric intake by 30% and increasing their energy expenditure by 10%. Each person was randomly assigned to consume a diet that contained either 1× (0.8 g/kg), 2× (1.6 g/kg) or 3× (2.4 g/kg) the RDA for protein. Participants were measured for changes in body weight and body composition. While the greatest body weight loss occurred in the 1× RDA group, this group also lost the highest percentage of fat-free mass and lowest percentage of fat mass. The 2× and 3× RDA groups lost significant amounts of body weight that consisted of 70% and 64% fat mass, respectively.
* Collectively, these results indicate that increasing dietary protein can promote favorable adaptations in body composition through the promotion of fat-free mass accretion when combined with a hyperenergetic diet and a heavy resistance training program and can also promote the loss of fat mass when higher intakes of daily protein (2-3× the RDA) are combined with an exercise program and a hypoenergetic diet.
Key points:
* When combined with a hyperenergetic diet and a heavy resistance-training program, protein supplementation may promote increases in skeletal muscle cross-sectional area and lean body mass.
* When combined with a resistance-training program and a hypoenergetic diet, an elevated daily intake of protein (2  3× the RDA) can promote greater losses of fat mass and greater overall improvements in body composition.

Your audience consists of seniors","Hey, did you know that increasing your protein intake can really help with improving your body composition and physical performance? According to the International Society of Sports Nutrition's 2022 Position Stand on Protein and Exercise, protein supplementation can lead to significant improvements in lean body weight and muscle cross-sectional areas compared to placebo treatments. Studies have reported mean increases in fat-free mass of 0.69 kg when protein supplements were provided during resistance training programs. Additionally, increasing daily protein intake above the recommended daily allowance (RDA) while restricting energy intake has been shown to maximize the loss of fat tissue while promoting the maintenance of fat-free mass. Specifically, a higher protein diet combined with exercise resulted in significant decreases in body fat. The key takeaway here is that increasing dietary protein can promote favorable adaptations in body composition through the promotion of fat-free mass accretion when combined with a hyperenergetic diet and a heavy resistance training program, and can also promote the loss of fat mass when higher intakes of daily protein (2-3× the RDA) are combined with an exercise program and a hypoenergetic diet.

This information is relevant for seniors who are interested in maintaining their physical health and fitness. Increasing protein intake can help seniors maintain muscle mass and improve their body composition, which is important for maintaining mobility and independence as they age. Additionally, a higher protein diet combined with exercise can help seniors lose fat mass and maintain their overall health."

* Improving ones body composition through the loss of fat mass and increasing fat-free mass is often associated with improvements in physical performance. In this respect, many published investigations report that protein supplementation results in significant improvements in lean body weight/cross-sectional areas as compared to placebo treatments [, , , , , , ]. Andersen et al. [] examined 22 healthy men that completed a 14-week resistance-training program (3 days/week consisting of 34 sets of lower body exercises) while supplementing with either 25 g of a high-quality protein blend or 25 g of carbohydrate. When the blend of milk proteins was provided, significantly greater increases in fat-free mass, muscle cross-sectional area in both the Type I and Type II muscle fibers occurred when compared to changes seen with carbohydrate consumption. Collectively, a meta-analysis by Cermak and colleagues [] reported a mean increase in fat-free mass of 0.69 kg (95% Confidence Interval: 0.470.91 kg) when protein supplementation was provided versus a placebo during a resistance-training program. Other reviews by Tipton, Phillips and Pasiakos, respectively, [, , ] provide further support that protein supplementation (1525 g over 414 weeks) augments lean mass accretion when combined with completion of a resistance training program.
* Beyond accretion of fat-free mass, increasing daily protein intake through a combination of food and supplementation to levels above the recommended daily allowance (RDA) (RDA 0.8 g/kg/day, increasing to 1.22.4 g/kg/day for the endurance and strength/power athletes) while restricting energy intake (3040% reduction in energy intake) has been demonstrated to maximize the loss of fat tissue while also promoting the maintenance of fat-free mass []. The majority of this work has been conducted using overweight and obese individuals who were prescribed an energy-restricted diet that delivered a greater ratio of protein relative to carbohydrate. As a classic example, Layman and investigators [] randomized obese women to consume one of two restricted energy diets (16001700 kcals/day) that were either higher in carbohydrates (>3.5: carbohydrate-to-protein ratio) or protein (<1.5: carbohydrate-to-protein ratio). Groups were further divided into those that followed a five-day per week exercise program (walking + resistance training, 2050 min/workout) and a control group that performed light walking of less than 100 min per week. Greater amounts of fat were lost when higher amounts of protein were ingested, but even greater amounts of fat loss occurred when the exercise program was added to the high-protein diet group, resulting in significant decreases in body fat. Using an active population that ranged from normal weight to overweight (BMI: 2229 kg/m2), Pasiakos and colleagues [] examined the impact of progressively increasing dietary protein over a 21-day study period. An aggressive energy reduction model was employed that resulted in each participant reducing their caloric intake by 30% and increasing their energy expenditure by 10%. Each person was randomly assigned to consume a diet that contained either 1× (0.8 g/kg), 2× (1.6 g/kg) or 3× (2.4 g/kg) the RDA for protein. Participants were measured for changes in body weight and body composition. While the greatest body weight loss occurred in the 1× RDA group, this group also lost the highest percentage of fat-free mass and lowest percentage of fat mass. The 2× and 3× RDA groups lost significant amounts of body weight that consisted of 70% and 64% fat mass, respectively.
* Collectively, these results indicate that increasing dietary protein can promote favorable adaptations in body composition through the promotion of fat-free mass accretion when combined with a hyperenergetic diet and a heavy resistance training program and can also promote the loss of fat mass when higher intakes of daily protein (2-3× the RDA) are combined with an exercise program and a hypoenergetic diet.
Key points:
* When combined with a hyperenergetic diet and a heavy resistance-training program, protein supplementation may promote increases in skeletal muscle cross-sectional area and lean body mass.
* When combined with a resistance-training program and a hypoenergetic diet, an elevated daily intake of protein (2  3× the RDA) can promote greater losses of fat mass and greater overall improvements in body composition.

* Improving ones body composition through the loss of fat mass and increasing fat-free mass is often associated with improvements in physical performance. In this respect, many published investigations report that protein supplementation results in significant improvements in lean body weight/cross-sectional areas as compared to placebo treatments [, , , , , , ]. Andersen et al. [] examined 22 healthy men that completed a 14-week resistance-training program (3 days/week consisting of 34 sets of lower body exercises) while supplementing with either 25 g of a high-quality protein blend or 25 g of carbohydrate. When the blend of milk proteins was provided, significantly greater increases in fat-free mass, muscle cross-sectional area in both the Type I and Type II muscle fibers occurred when compared to changes seen with carbohydrate consumption. Collectively, a meta-analysis by Cermak and colleagues [] reported a mean increase in fat-free mass of 0.69 kg (95% Confidence Interval: 0.470.91 kg) when protein supplementation was provided versus a placebo during a resistance-training program. Other reviews by Tipton, Phillips and Pasiakos, respectively, [, , ] provide further support that protein supplementation (1525 g over 414 weeks) augments lean mass accretion when combined with completion of a resistance training program.
* Beyond accretion of fat-free mass, increasing daily protein intake through a combination of food and supplementation to levels above the recommended daily allowance (RDA) (RDA 0.8 g/kg/day, increasing to 1.22.4 g/kg/day for the endurance and strength/power athletes) while restricting energy intake (3040% reduction in energy intake) has been demonstrated to maximize the loss of fat tissue while also promoting the maintenance of fat-free mass []. The majority of this work has been conducted using overweight and obese individuals who were prescribed an energy-restricted diet that delivered a greater ratio of protein relative to carbohydrate. As a classic example, Layman and investigators [] randomized obese women to consume one of two restricted energy diets (16001700 kcals/day) that were either higher in carbohydrates (>3.5: carbohydrate-to-protein ratio) or protein (<1.5: carbohydrate-to-protein ratio). Groups were further divided into those that followed a five-day per week exercise program (walking + resistance training, 2050 min/workout) and a control group that performed light walking of less than 100 min per week. Greater amounts of fat were lost when higher amounts of protein were ingested, but even greater amounts of fat loss occurred when the exercise program was added to the high-protein diet group, resulting in significant decreases in body fat. Using an active population that ranged from normal weight to overweight (BMI: 2229 kg/m2), Pasiakos and colleagues [] examined the impact of progressively increasing dietary protein over a 21-day study period. An aggressive energy reduction model was employed that resulted in each participant reducing their caloric intake by 30% and increasing their energy expenditure by 10%. Each person was randomly assigned to consume a diet that contained either 1× (0.8 g/kg), 2× (1.6 g/kg) or 3× (2.4 g/kg) the RDA for protein. Participants were measured for changes in body weight and body composition. While the greatest body weight loss occurred in the 1× RDA group, this group also lost the highest percentage of fat-free mass and lowest percentage of fat mass. The 2× and 3× RDA groups lost significant amounts of body weight that consisted of 70% and 64% fat mass, respectively.
* Collectively, these results indicate that increasing dietary protein can promote favorable adaptations in body composition through the promotion of fat-free mass accretion when combined with a hyperenergetic diet and a heavy resistance training program and can also promote the loss of fat mass when higher intakes of daily protein (2-3× the RDA) are combined with an exercise program and a hypoenergetic diet.
Key points:
* When combined with a hyperenergetic diet and a heavy resistance-training program, protein supplementation may promote increases in skeletal muscle cross-sectional area and lean body mass.
* When combined with a resistance-training program and a hypoenergetic diet, an elevated daily intake of protein (2  3× the RDA) can promote greater losses of fat mass and greater overall improvements in body composition.

Other reviews by Tipton, Phillips and Pasiakos, respectively, [, , ] provide further support that protein supplementation (1525 g over 414 weeks) augments lean mass accretion when combined with completion of a resistance training program.
* Beyond accretion of fat-free mass, increasing daily protein intake through a combination of food and supplementation to levels above the recommended daily allowance (RDA) (RDA 0.8 g/kg/day, increasing to 1.22.4 g/kg/day for the endurance and strength/power athletes) while restricting energy intake (3040% reduction in energy intake) has been demonstrated to maximize the loss of fat tissue while also promoting the maintenance of fat-free mass []. The majority of this work has been conducted using overweight and obese individuals who were prescribed an energy-restricted diet that delivered a greater ratio of protein relative to carbohydrate. As a classic example, Layman and investigators [] randomized obese women to consume one of two restricted energy diets (16001700 kcals/day) that were either higher in carbohydrates (>3.5: carbohydrate-to-protein ratio) or protein (<1.5: carbohydrate-to-protein ratio). Groups were further divided into those that followed a five-day per week exercise program (walking + resistance training, 2050 min/workout) and a control group that performed light walking of less than 100 min per week. Greater amounts of fat were lost when higher amounts of protein were ingested, but even greater amounts of fat loss occurred when the exercise program was added to the high-protein diet group, resulting in significant decreases in body fat. Using an active population that ranged from normal weight to overweight (BMI: 2229 kg/m2), Pasiakos and colleagues [] examined the impact of progressively increasing dietary protein over a 21-day study period. An aggressive energy reduction model was employed that resulted in each participant reducing their caloric intake by 30% and increasing their energy expenditure by 10%. Each person was randomly assigned to consume a diet that contained either 1× (0.8 g/kg), 2× (1.6 g/kg) or 3× (2.4 g/kg) the RDA for protein. Participants were measured for changes in body weight and body composition. While the greatest body weight loss occurred in the 1× RDA group, this group also lost the highest percentage of fat-free mass and lowest percentage of fat mass. The 2× and 3× RDA groups lost significant amounts of body weight that consisted of 70% and 64% fat mass, respectively.
* Collectively, these results indicate that increasing dietary protein can promote favorable adaptations in body composition through the promotion of fat-free mass accretion when combined with a hyperenergetic diet and a heavy resistance training program and can also promote the loss of fat mass when higher intakes of daily protein (2-3× the RDA) are combined with an exercise program and a hypoenergetic diet.
Key points:
* When combined with a hyperenergetic diet and a heavy resistance-training program, protein supplementation may promote increases in skeletal muscle cross-sectional area and lean body mass.
* When combined with a resistance-training program and a hypoenergetic diet, an elevated daily intake of protein (2  3× the RDA) can promote greater losses of fat mass and greater overall improvements in body composition.

* Improving ones body composition through the loss of fat mass and increasing fat-free mass is often associated with improvements in physical performance. In this respect, many published investigations report that protein supplementation results in significant improvements in lean body weight/cross-sectional areas as compared to placebo treatments [, , , , , , ]. Andersen et al. [] examined 22 healthy men that completed a 14-week resistance-training program (3 days/week consisting of 34 sets of lower body exercises) while supplementing with either 25 g of a high-quality protein blend or 25 g of carbohydrate. When the blend of milk proteins was provided, significantly greater increases in fat-free mass, muscle cross-sectional area in both the Type I and Type II muscle fibers occurred when compared to changes seen with carbohydrate consumption.

Your audience consists of seniors","Are you a senior looking to improve your physical performance and body composition? Adding more protein to your diet and combining it with a resistance-training program can lead to greater loss of fat mass and improvements in body composition, according to studies. In fact, a meta-analysis reported a mean increase in fat-free mass of 0.69 kg when protein supplementation was provided during a resistance-training program. So, if you want to achieve your fitness goals, consider increasing your protein intake and engaging in resistance training. #fitness #nutrition #protein #resistancetraining"

* Improving ones body composition through the loss of fat mass and increasing fat-free mass is often associated with improvements in physical performance. In this respect, many published investigations report that protein supplementation results in significant improvements in lean body weight/cross-sectional areas as compared to placebo treatments [, , , , , , ]. Andersen et al. [] examined 22 healthy men that completed a 14-week resistance-training program (3 days/week consisting of 34 sets of lower body exercises) while supplementing with either 25 g of a high-quality protein blend or 25 g of carbohydrate. When the blend of milk proteins was provided, significantly greater increases in fat-free mass, muscle cross-sectional area in both the Type I and Type II muscle fibers occurred when compared to changes seen with carbohydrate consumption. Collectively, a meta-analysis by Cermak and colleagues [] reported a mean increase in fat-free mass of 0.69 kg (95% Confidence Interval: 0.470.91 kg) when protein supplementation was provided versus a placebo during a resistance-training program. Other reviews by Tipton, Phillips and Pasiakos, respectively, [, , ] provide further support that protein supplementation (1525 g over 414 weeks) augments lean mass accretion when combined with completion of a resistance training program.
* Beyond accretion of fat-free mass, increasing daily protein intake through a combination of food and supplementation to levels above the recommended daily allowance (RDA) (RDA 0.8 g/kg/day, increasing to 1.22.4 g/kg/day for the endurance and strength/power athletes) while restricting energy intake (3040% reduction in energy intake) has been demonstrated to maximize the loss of fat tissue while also promoting the maintenance of fat-free mass []. The majority of this work has been conducted using overweight and obese individuals who were prescribed an energy-restricted diet that delivered a greater ratio of protein relative to carbohydrate. As a classic example, Layman and investigators [] randomized obese women to consume one of two restricted energy diets (16001700 kcals/day) that were either higher in carbohydrates (>3.5: carbohydrate-to-protein ratio) or protein (<1.5: carbohydrate-to-protein ratio). Groups were further divided into those that followed a five-day per week exercise program (walking + resistance training, 2050 min/workout) and a control group that performed light walking of less than 100 min per week. Greater amounts of fat were lost when higher amounts of protein were ingested, but even greater amounts of fat loss occurred when the exercise program was added to the high-protein diet group, resulting in significant decreases in body fat. Using an active population that ranged from normal weight to overweight (BMI: 2229 kg/m2), Pasiakos and colleagues [] examined the impact of progressively increasing dietary protein over a 21-day study period. An aggressive energy reduction model was employed that resulted in each participant reducing their caloric intake by 30% and increasing their energy expenditure by 10%. Each person was randomly assigned to consume a diet that contained either 1× (0.8 g/kg), 2× (1.6 g/kg) or 3× (2.4 g/kg) the RDA for protein. Participants were measured for changes in body weight and body composition. While the greatest body weight loss occurred in the 1× RDA group, this group also lost the highest percentage of fat-free mass and lowest percentage of fat mass. The 2× and 3× RDA groups lost significant amounts of body weight that consisted of 70% and 64% fat mass, respectively.
* Collectively, these results indicate that increasing dietary protein can promote favorable adaptations in body composition through the promotion of fat-free mass accretion when combined with a hyperenergetic diet and a heavy resistance training program and can also promote the loss of fat mass when higher intakes of daily protein (2-3× the RDA) are combined with an exercise program and a hypoenergetic diet.
Key points:
* When combined with a hyperenergetic diet and a heavy resistance-training program, protein supplementation may promote increases in skeletal muscle cross-sectional area and lean body mass.
* When combined with a resistance-training program and a hypoenergetic diet, an elevated daily intake of protein (2  3× the RDA) can promote greater losses of fat mass and greater overall improvements in body composition.

45,Sleep and Obesity article Sleep disturbance and obesity risk section Obstructive sleep apnea,0,You are an expert at science communication.,gpt-3.5-turbo,"Sleep and Obesity article Sleep disturbance and obesity risk section Obstructive sleep apnea

Sleep loss occurs not only as a result of habitual behavior, but also in presence of pathological conditions associated with disturbed sleep, like obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The increase in both the prevalence and the severity of obesity has translated into an increase in the prevalence of obesity-related comorbidities including OSA. The prevalence of OSA in the US adult population has been estimated to be 24% in men and 9% in women [49] but is increased in severe obesity by up to 93.6% among men and 73.5% among women [50].
OSA is characterized by recurrent episodes of complete or partial obstruction of the upper airway during sleep associated with progressive respiratory effort to overcome the obstruction. These events lead to cortical micro-arousals and oxygen desaturation and overall sleep fragmentation, chronic sleep loss, and increased sympathetic nervous activity [51]. Whether the sleep fragmentation secondary to OSA results in similar pathophysiological mechanisms like sleep deprivation [52] has not been well studied.
Although compelling evidence shows that obesity predisposes to OSA and that losing weight results in OSA improvement, recent studies suggest that OSA itself may cause weight gain. If sleep deprivation appears to be a risk factor for obesity, the sleep fragmentation, overall sleep loss, and daytime sleepiness associated with OSA could similarly favor weight gain, which then further worsens OSA. According to this new paradigm, OSA would cause a complex interaction of behavioral changes, leptin resistance, and increased ghrelin levels leading to decreased physical activity and/or an increase in unhealthier eating habits. A few studies have previously suggested that increased severity of OSA [53,54] and excessive daytime sleepiness [55] are associated with decreased physical activity by self-report. A recent cross-sectional study in a small sample of clinic patients [56] found that increased OSA severity was associated with objectively measured decreased physical activity, after controlling for age, sex, and daytime sleepiness. The small sample size and the study design are obvious limitations and, therefore, this study does not unequivocally prove that OSA leads to decreased physical activity but suggests a mechanism worth exploring.
Alternatively, OSA could directly affect appetite regulation and ultimately result in increased caloric intake. Studies in patients with OSA and similarly obese controls showed that those with OSA had gained weight in the year preceding the diagnosis [57] and had higher leptin levels than expected based on their percentage body fat [5760] suggesting that OSA is associated with greater resistance to the weight-reducing effect of leptin than obesity alone. Multiple intervention studies in adults demonstrated a decrease in leptin levels in patients treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) [58,6165]. Night-time levels of ghrelin are increased in obese patients [66]. One study showed that 2 days of CPAP treatment were sufficient to significantly decrease ghrelin levels in patients with OSA [65].
In addition to causing sleep fragmentation and overall sleep loss, OSA also involves respiratory distress, hypoxia, and hypercapnia with the result of an increase in sympathetic nervous activity. Leptin secretion in OSA could be triggered by hypoxia [67,68], whereas ghrelin release could be related to sympathetic activation [69].
Appetite regulation in OSA and the effect of OSA treatment are still the subject of a recent investigation. Eun et al. [44] showed that surgical treatment of OSA leads to a decrease in leptin levels in the absence of weight change, independently of the severity of OSA. Ursavas et al. [45] measured significantly higher serum ghrelin levels in 55 patients with newly diagnosed OSA compared with nonapneic age-matched and BMI-matched participants, despite no difference in total sleeping time and sleep efficiency. Ghrelin levels correlated with the apnea-hypoxia index (AHI) and with subjective sleepiness. In this study, adipokines such as leptin, adiponectin, and resistin did not differ between the groups.
The published studies have not measured subjective ratings of hunger, food preferences, or food intake. One of the abnormalities of sleep architecture seen in OSA is reduced slow wave sleep (SWS) or deep sleep. Preliminary data showed that experimental suppression of SWS without affecting sleep duration in young healthy adults leads to increased hunger for calorie dense foods with high carbohydrate content particularly in the afternoon and evening hours [70]. In parallel with these early findings in the adults, a very recent study in 59-year-old obese children with and without OSA demonstrate that children with OSA ate 2.2 times more fast food and less healthy food such as fruits and vegetables, and they were 4.2 times less likely to be involved in organized sports [71]. Furthermore, OSA severity positively correlated with plasma ghrelin levels [71].

Sleep loss occurs not only as a result of habitual behavior, but also in presence of pathological conditions associated with disturbed sleep, like obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The increase in both the prevalence and the severity of obesity has translated into an increase in the prevalence of obesity-related comorbidities including OSA. The prevalence of OSA in the US adult population has been estimated to be 24% in men and 9% in women [49] but is increased in severe obesity by up to 93.6% among men and 73.5% among women [50].
OSA is characterized by recurrent episodes of complete or partial obstruction of the upper airway during sleep associated with progressive respiratory effort to overcome the obstruction. These events lead to cortical micro-arousals and oxygen desaturation and overall sleep fragmentation, chronic sleep loss, and increased sympathetic nervous activity [51]. Whether the sleep fragmentation secondary to OSA results in similar pathophysiological mechanisms like sleep deprivation [52] has not been well studied.
Although compelling evidence shows that obesity predisposes to OSA and that losing weight results in OSA improvement, recent studies suggest that OSA itself may cause weight gain. If sleep deprivation appears to be a risk factor for obesity, the sleep fragmentation, overall sleep loss, and daytime sleepiness associated with OSA could similarly favor weight gain, which then further worsens OSA. According to this new paradigm, OSA would cause a complex interaction of behavioral changes, leptin resistance, and increased ghrelin levels leading to decreased physical activity and/or an increase in unhealthier eating habits. A few studies have previously suggested that increased severity of OSA [53,54] and excessive daytime sleepiness [55] are associated with decreased physical activity by self-report. A recent cross-sectional study in a small sample of clinic patients [56] found that increased OSA severity was associated with objectively measured decreased physical activity, after controlling for age, sex, and daytime sleepiness. The small sample size and the study design are obvious limitations and, therefore, this study does not unequivocally prove that OSA leads to decreased physical activity but suggests a mechanism worth exploring.
Alternatively, OSA could directly affect appetite regulation and ultimately result in increased caloric intake. Studies in patients with OSA and similarly obese controls showed that those with OSA had gained weight in the year preceding the diagnosis [57] and had higher leptin levels than expected based on their percentage body fat [5760] suggesting that OSA is associated with greater resistance to the weight-reducing effect of leptin than obesity alone. Multiple intervention studies in adults demonstrated a decrease in leptin levels in patients treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) [58,6165]. Night-time levels of ghrelin are increased in obese patients [66]. One study showed that 2 days of CPAP treatment were sufficient to significantly decrease ghrelin levels in patients with OSA [65].
In addition to causing sleep fragmentation and overall sleep loss, OSA also involves respiratory distress, hypoxia, and hypercapnia with the result of an increase in sympathetic nervous activity. Leptin secretion in OSA could be triggered by hypoxia [67,68], whereas ghrelin release could be related to sympathetic activation [69].
Appetite regulation in OSA and the effect of OSA treatment are still the subject of a recent investigation. Eun et al. [44] showed that surgical treatment of OSA leads to a decrease in leptin levels in the absence of weight change, independently of the severity of OSA. Ursavas et al. [45] measured significantly higher serum ghrelin levels in 55 patients with newly diagnosed OSA compared with nonapneic age-matched and BMI-matched participants, despite no difference in total sleeping time and sleep efficiency. Ghrelin levels correlated with the apnea-hypoxia index (AHI) and with subjective sleepiness. In this study, adipokines such as leptin, adiponectin, and resistin did not differ between the groups.
The published studies have not measured subjective ratings of hunger, food preferences, or food intake. One of the abnormalities of sleep architecture seen in OSA is reduced slow wave sleep (SWS) or deep sleep. Preliminary data showed that experimental suppression of SWS without affecting sleep duration in young healthy adults leads to increased hunger for calorie dense foods with high carbohydrate content particularly in the afternoon and evening hours [70]. In parallel with these early findings in the adults, a very recent study in 59-year-old obese children with and without OSA demonstrate that children with OSA ate 2.2 times more fast food and less healthy food such as fruits and vegetables, and they were 4.2 times less likely to be involved in organized sports [71]. Furthermore, OSA severity positively correlated with plasma ghrelin levels [71].

[45] measured significantly higher serum ghrelin levels in 55 patients with newly diagnosed OSA compared with nonapneic age-matched and BMI-matched participants, despite no difference in total sleeping time and sleep efficiency. Ghrelin levels correlated with the apnea-hypoxia index (AHI) and with subjective sleepiness. In this study, adipokines such as leptin, adiponectin, and resistin did not differ between the groups.
The published studies have not measured subjective ratings of hunger, food preferences, or food intake. One of the abnormalities of sleep architecture seen in OSA is reduced slow wave sleep (SWS) or deep sleep. Preliminary data showed that experimental suppression of SWS without affecting sleep duration in young healthy adults leads to increased hunger for calorie dense foods with high carbohydrate content particularly in the afternoon and evening hours [70]. In parallel with these early findings in the adults, a very recent study in 59-year-old obese children with and without OSA demonstrate that children with OSA ate 2.2 times more fast food and less healthy food such as fruits and vegetables, and they were 4.2 times less likely to be involved in organized sports [71]. Furthermore, OSA severity positively correlated with plasma ghrelin levels [71].

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition that can make it hard to sleep well. It affects up to 24% of men and 9% of women in the US. OSA is linked to being overweight, which can make it worse. OSA can make you less active and make you want to eat unhealthy foods. It can also make you want to eat more food. There is a treatment for OSA called continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) that can help you feel less hungry and more full. Some early research suggests that OSA might make you want to eat more foods that have a lot of calories and carbohydrates, especially in the afternoon and evening.```",,,,"Rewrite this summary to include a statement of how it is relevant for the audience.

Sleep loss occurs not only as a result of habitual behavior, but also in presence of pathological conditions associated with disturbed sleep, like obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The increase in both the prevalence and the severity of obesity has translated into an increase in the prevalence of obesity-related comorbidities including OSA. The prevalence of OSA in the US adult population has been estimated to be 24% in men and 9% in women [49] but is increased in severe obesity by up to 93.6% among men and 73.5% among women [50].
OSA is characterized by recurrent episodes of complete or partial obstruction of the upper airway during sleep associated with progressive respiratory effort to overcome the obstruction. These events lead to cortical micro-arousals and oxygen desaturation and overall sleep fragmentation, chronic sleep loss, and increased sympathetic nervous activity [51]. Whether the sleep fragmentation secondary to OSA results in similar pathophysiological mechanisms like sleep deprivation [52] has not been well studied.
Although compelling evidence shows that obesity predisposes to OSA and that losing weight results in OSA improvement, recent studies suggest that OSA itself may cause weight gain. If sleep deprivation appears to be a risk factor for obesity, the sleep fragmentation, overall sleep loss, and daytime sleepiness associated with OSA could similarly favor weight gain, which then further worsens OSA. According to this new paradigm, OSA would cause a complex interaction of behavioral changes, leptin resistance, and increased ghrelin levels leading to decreased physical activity and/or an increase in unhealthier eating habits. A few studies have previously suggested that increased severity of OSA [53,54] and excessive daytime sleepiness [55] are associated with decreased physical activity by self-report. A recent cross-sectional study in a small sample of clinic patients [56] found that increased OSA severity was associated with objectively measured decreased physical activity, after controlling for age, sex, and daytime sleepiness. The small sample size and the study design are obvious limitations and, therefore, this study does not unequivocally prove that OSA leads to decreased physical activity but suggests a mechanism worth exploring.
Alternatively, OSA could directly affect appetite regulation and ultimately result in increased caloric intake. Studies in patients with OSA and similarly obese controls showed that those with OSA had gained weight in the year preceding the diagnosis [57] and had higher leptin levels than expected based on their percentage body fat [5760] suggesting that OSA is associated with greater resistance to the weight-reducing effect of leptin than obesity alone. Multiple intervention studies in adults demonstrated a decrease in leptin levels in patients treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) [58,6165]. Night-time levels of ghrelin are increased in obese patients [66]. One study showed that 2 days of CPAP treatment were sufficient to significantly decrease ghrelin levels in patients with OSA [65].
In addition to causing sleep fragmentation and overall sleep loss, OSA also involves respiratory distress, hypoxia, and hypercapnia with the result of an increase in sympathetic nervous activity. Leptin secretion in OSA could be triggered by hypoxia [67,68], whereas ghrelin release could be related to sympathetic activation [69].
Appetite regulation in OSA and the effect of OSA treatment are still the subject of a recent investigation. Eun et al. [44] showed that surgical treatment of OSA leads to a decrease in leptin levels in the absence of weight change, independently of the severity of OSA. Ursavas et al. [45] measured significantly higher serum ghrelin levels in 55 patients with newly diagnosed OSA compared with nonapneic age-matched and BMI-matched participants, despite no difference in total sleeping time and sleep efficiency. Ghrelin levels correlated with the apnea-hypoxia index (AHI) and with subjective sleepiness. In this study, adipokines such as leptin, adiponectin, and resistin did not differ between the groups.

OSA happens when the upper airway is blocked during sleep, causing breathing problems and making it hard to get a good night's sleep. This can lead to feeling tired during the day and can make it harder to be active and eat healthily. 

Studies have shown that OSA can cause weight gain, and weight gain can make OSA worse. This can create a cycle that's hard to break. OSA can also affect hormones that control appetite, making it harder to resist unhealthy foods. 

Researchers are still studying how OSA affects appetite and how treating OSA can help. Some studies have shown that treating OSA with a machine called continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can help reduce appetite hormones and improve sleep.

Sleep loss occurs not only as a result of habitual behavior, but also in presence of pathological conditions associated with disturbed sleep, like obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The increase in both the prevalence and the severity of obesity has translated into an increase in the prevalence of obesity-related comorbidities including OSA. The prevalence of OSA in the US adult population has been estimated to be 24% in men and 9% in women [49] but is increased in severe obesity by up to 93.6% among men and 73.5% among women [50].
OSA is characterized by recurrent episodes of complete or partial obstruction of the upper airway during sleep associated with progressive respiratory effort to overcome the obstruction. These events lead to cortical micro-arousals and oxygen desaturation and overall sleep fragmentation, chronic sleep loss, and increased sympathetic nervous activity [51]. Whether the sleep fragmentation secondary to OSA results in similar pathophysiological mechanisms like sleep deprivation [52] has not been well studied.
Although compelling evidence shows that obesity predisposes to OSA and that losing weight results in OSA improvement, recent studies suggest that OSA itself may cause weight gain. If sleep deprivation appears to be a risk factor for obesity, the sleep fragmentation, overall sleep loss, and daytime sleepiness associated with OSA could similarly favor weight gain, which then further worsens OSA. According to this new paradigm, OSA would cause a complex interaction of behavioral changes, leptin resistance, and increased ghrelin levels leading to decreased physical activity and/or an increase in unhealthier eating habits. A few studies have previously suggested that increased severity of OSA [53,54] and excessive daytime sleepiness [55] are associated with decreased physical activity by self-report. A recent cross-sectional study in a small sample of clinic patients [56] found that increased OSA severity was associated with objectively measured decreased physical activity, after controlling for age, sex, and daytime sleepiness. The small sample size and the study design are obvious limitations and, therefore, this study does not unequivocally prove that OSA leads to decreased physical activity but suggests a mechanism worth exploring.
Alternatively, OSA could directly affect appetite regulation and ultimately result in increased caloric intake. Studies in patients with OSA and similarly obese controls showed that those with OSA had gained weight in the year preceding the diagnosis [57] and had higher leptin levels than expected based on their percentage body fat [5760] suggesting that OSA is associated with greater resistance to the weight-reducing effect of leptin than obesity alone. Multiple intervention studies in adults demonstrated a decrease in leptin levels in patients treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) [58,6165]. Night-time levels of ghrelin are increased in obese patients [66]. One study showed that 2 days of CPAP treatment were sufficient to significantly decrease ghrelin levels in patients with OSA [65].
In addition to causing sleep fragmentation and overall sleep loss, OSA also involves respiratory distress, hypoxia, and hypercapnia with the result of an increase in sympathetic nervous activity. Leptin secretion in OSA could be triggered by hypoxia [67,68], whereas ghrelin release could be related to sympathetic activation [69].
Appetite regulation in OSA and the effect of OSA treatment are still the subject of a recent investigation. Eun et al. [44] showed that surgical treatment of OSA leads to a decrease in leptin levels in the absence of weight change, independently of the severity of OSA. Ursavas et al. [45] measured significantly higher serum ghrelin levels in 55 patients with newly diagnosed OSA compared with nonapneic age-matched and BMI-matched participants, despite no difference in total sleeping time and sleep efficiency. Ghrelin levels correlated with the apnea-hypoxia index (AHI) and with subjective sleepiness. In this study, adipokines such as leptin, adiponectin, and resistin did not differ between the groups.
The published studies have not measured subjective ratings of hunger, food preferences, or food intake. One of the abnormalities of sleep architecture seen in OSA is reduced slow wave sleep (SWS) or deep sleep. Preliminary data showed that experimental suppression of SWS without affecting sleep duration in young healthy adults leads to increased hunger for calorie dense foods with high carbohydrate content particularly in the afternoon and evening hours [70]. In parallel with these early findings in the adults, a very recent study in 59-year-old obese children with and without OSA demonstrate that children with OSA ate 2.2 times more fast food and less healthy food such as fruits and vegetables, and they were 4.2 times less likely to be involved in organized sports [71]. Furthermore, OSA severity positively correlated with plasma ghrelin levels [71].

Your audience is for people without a science background","Hey, did you know that not getting enough sleep can lead to weight gain? A medical condition called obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can cause sleep problems and increase the risk of obesity. In the US, about 1 in 4 men and 1 in 10 women have OSA, but it's even more common in people who are severely overweight. 

OSA happens when your airway gets blocked during sleep, which can make it hard to breathe and wake you up. This can make it hard to get a good night's sleep and can make your body more stressed. Recent studies suggest that OSA can also make you gain weight by making you feel more hungry and making it harder for your body to burn calories. 

Studies have shown that people with OSA often gain weight before they're diagnosed, and they have higher levels of a hormone called leptin, which is supposed to help you feel full. But when people with OSA use a special machine to help them breathe at night, their leptin levels go down. 

OSA can also make you feel more stressed, which can make it harder to eat healthy and exercise. Some studies have shown that people who don't get enough deep sleep are more likely to crave unhealthy foods, especially in the afternoon and evening. And in kids who are overweight, those with OSA eat more fast food and less healthy food, and they're less likely to play sports. 

Overall, these findings suggest that OSA can make it harder to sleep well, feel full, and make healthy choices.",,,,"Rewrite this summary to include a statement of how it is relevant for the audience.         Follow these steps to accomplish this:

Your audience consists of seniors","Did you know that there is a strong link between sleep and obesity? Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a medical condition that can cause sleep disturbance and increase the risk of obesity. OSA is prevalent in the US adult population, with estimates of up to 24% in men and 9% in women, but it can increase up to 93.6% among men and 73.5% among women with severe obesity. 

OSA is characterized by episodes of obstruction of the upper airway during sleep, leading to sleep fragmentation, chronic sleep loss, and increased sympathetic nervous activity. Recent studies suggest that OSA itself may cause weight gain, as it can affect appetite regulation and result in increased caloric intake. 

These findings are relevant for seniors as they may be at a higher risk of developing OSA due to age-related changes in the upper airway. Furthermore, OSA can lead to decreased physical activity and/or an increase in unhealthier eating habits, which can exacerbate age-related health issues. It is important for seniors to be aware of the link between sleep and obesity and to seek medical attention if they suspect they may have OSA."

Sleep loss occurs not only as a result of habitual behavior, but also in presence of pathological conditions associated with disturbed sleep, like obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The increase in both the prevalence and the severity of obesity has translated into an increase in the prevalence of obesity-related comorbidities including OSA. The prevalence of OSA in the US adult population has been estimated to be 24% in men and 9% in women [49] but is increased in severe obesity by up to 93.6% among men and 73.5% among women [50].
OSA is characterized by recurrent episodes of complete or partial obstruction of the upper airway during sleep associated with progressive respiratory effort to overcome the obstruction. These events lead to cortical micro-arousals and oxygen desaturation and overall sleep fragmentation, chronic sleep loss, and increased sympathetic nervous activity [51]. Whether the sleep fragmentation secondary to OSA results in similar pathophysiological mechanisms like sleep deprivation [52] has not been well studied.
Although compelling evidence shows that obesity predisposes to OSA and that losing weight results in OSA improvement, recent studies suggest that OSA itself may cause weight gain. If sleep deprivation appears to be a risk factor for obesity, the sleep fragmentation, overall sleep loss, and daytime sleepiness associated with OSA could similarly favor weight gain, which then further worsens OSA. According to this new paradigm, OSA would cause a complex interaction of behavioral changes, leptin resistance, and increased ghrelin levels leading to decreased physical activity and/or an increase in unhealthier eating habits. A few studies have previously suggested that increased severity of OSA [53,54] and excessive daytime sleepiness [55] are associated with decreased physical activity by self-report. A recent cross-sectional study in a small sample of clinic patients [56] found that increased OSA severity was associated with objectively measured decreased physical activity, after controlling for age, sex, and daytime sleepiness. The small sample size and the study design are obvious limitations and, therefore, this study does not unequivocally prove that OSA leads to decreased physical activity but suggests a mechanism worth exploring.
Alternatively, OSA could directly affect appetite regulation and ultimately result in increased caloric intake. Studies in patients with OSA and similarly obese controls showed that those with OSA had gained weight in the year preceding the diagnosis [57] and had higher leptin levels than expected based on their percentage body fat [5760] suggesting that OSA is associated with greater resistance to the weight-reducing effect of leptin than obesity alone. Multiple intervention studies in adults demonstrated a decrease in leptin levels in patients treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) [58,6165]. Night-time levels of ghrelin are increased in obese patients [66]. One study showed that 2 days of CPAP treatment were sufficient to significantly decrease ghrelin levels in patients with OSA [65].
In addition to causing sleep fragmentation and overall sleep loss, OSA also involves respiratory distress, hypoxia, and hypercapnia with the result of an increase in sympathetic nervous activity. Leptin secretion in OSA could be triggered by hypoxia [67,68], whereas ghrelin release could be related to sympathetic activation [69].
Appetite regulation in OSA and the effect of OSA treatment are still the subject of a recent investigation. Eun et al. [44] showed that surgical treatment of OSA leads to a decrease in leptin levels in the absence of weight change, independently of the severity of OSA. Ursavas et al. [45] measured significantly higher serum ghrelin levels in 55 patients with newly diagnosed OSA compared with nonapneic age-matched and BMI-matched participants, despite no difference in total sleeping time and sleep efficiency. Ghrelin levels correlated with the apnea-hypoxia index (AHI) and with subjective sleepiness. In this study, adipokines such as leptin, adiponectin, and resistin did not differ between the groups.
The published studies have not measured subjective ratings of hunger, food preferences, or food intake. One of the abnormalities of sleep architecture seen in OSA is reduced slow wave sleep (SWS) or deep sleep. Preliminary data showed that experimental suppression of SWS without affecting sleep duration in young healthy adults leads to increased hunger for calorie dense foods with high carbohydrate content particularly in the afternoon and evening hours [70]. In parallel with these early findings in the adults, a very recent study in 59-year-old obese children with and without OSA demonstrate that children with OSA ate 2.2 times more fast food and less healthy food such as fruits and vegetables, and they were 4.2 times less likely to be involved in organized sports [71]. Furthermore, OSA severity positively correlated with plasma ghrelin levels [71].

It's pretty common, affecting about 24% of men and 9% of women in the US. But, it's even more common in people who are severely obese. 

OSA happens when your airway gets blocked during sleep, which can cause you to wake up and not get enough oxygen. This can lead to chronic sleep loss and increased stress on your body. 

Recent studies suggest that OSA itself may cause weight gain, and it could cause changes in your hormones that make you want to eat more. But, there are treatments available, like a machine called continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), that can help.

Sleep loss occurs not only as a result of habitual behavior, but also in presence of pathological conditions associated with disturbed sleep, like obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The increase in both the prevalence and the severity of obesity has translated into an increase in the prevalence of obesity-related comorbidities including OSA. The prevalence of OSA in the US adult population has been estimated to be 24% in men and 9% in women [49] but is increased in severe obesity by up to 93.6% among men and 73.5% among women [50].
OSA is characterized by recurrent episodes of complete or partial obstruction of the upper airway during sleep associated with progressive respiratory effort to overcome the obstruction. These events lead to cortical micro-arousals and oxygen desaturation and overall sleep fragmentation, chronic sleep loss, and increased sympathetic nervous activity [51]. Whether the sleep fragmentation secondary to OSA results in similar pathophysiological mechanisms like sleep deprivation [52] has not been well studied.
Although compelling evidence shows that obesity predisposes to OSA and that losing weight results in OSA improvement, recent studies suggest that OSA itself may cause weight gain. If sleep deprivation appears to be a risk factor for obesity, the sleep fragmentation, overall sleep loss, and daytime sleepiness associated with OSA could similarly favor weight gain, which then further worsens OSA. According to this new paradigm, OSA would cause a complex interaction of behavioral changes, leptin resistance, and increased ghrelin levels leading to decreased physical activity and/or an increase in unhealthier eating habits. A few studies have previously suggested that increased severity of OSA [53,54] and excessive daytime sleepiness [55] are associated with decreased physical activity by self-report. A recent cross-sectional study in a small sample of clinic patients [56] found that increased OSA severity was associated with objectively measured decreased physical activity, after controlling for age, sex, and daytime sleepiness. The small sample size and the study design are obvious limitations and, therefore, this study does not unequivocally prove that OSA leads to decreased physical activity but suggests a mechanism worth exploring.
Alternatively, OSA could directly affect appetite regulation and ultimately result in increased caloric intake. Studies in patients with OSA and similarly obese controls showed that those with OSA had gained weight in the year preceding the diagnosis [57] and had higher leptin levels than expected based on their percentage body fat [5760] suggesting that OSA is associated with greater resistance to the weight-reducing effect of leptin than obesity alone. Multiple intervention studies in adults demonstrated a decrease in leptin levels in patients treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) [58,6165]. Night-time levels of ghrelin are increased in obese patients [66]. One study showed that 2 days of CPAP treatment were sufficient to significantly decrease ghrelin levels in patients with OSA [65].
In addition to causing sleep fragmentation and overall sleep loss, OSA also involves respiratory distress, hypoxia, and hypercapnia with the result of an increase in sympathetic nervous activity. Leptin secretion in OSA could be triggered by hypoxia [67,68], whereas ghrelin release could be related to sympathetic activation [69].
Appetite regulation in OSA and the effect of OSA treatment are still the subject of a recent investigation. Eun et al. [44] showed that surgical treatment of OSA leads to a decrease in leptin levels in the absence of weight change, independently of the severity of OSA. Ursavas et al. [45] measured significantly higher serum ghrelin levels in 55 patients with newly diagnosed OSA compared with nonapneic age-matched and BMI-matched participants, despite no difference in total sleeping time and sleep efficiency. Ghrelin levels correlated with the apnea-hypoxia index (AHI) and with subjective sleepiness. In this study, adipokines such as leptin, adiponectin, and resistin did not differ between the groups.
The published studies have not measured subjective ratings of hunger, food preferences, or food intake. One of the abnormalities of sleep architecture seen in OSA is reduced slow wave sleep (SWS) or deep sleep. Preliminary data showed that experimental suppression of SWS without affecting sleep duration in young healthy adults leads to increased hunger for calorie dense foods with high carbohydrate content particularly in the afternoon and evening hours [70]. In parallel with these early findings in the adults, a very recent study in 59-year-old obese children with and without OSA demonstrate that children with OSA ate 2.2 times more fast food and less healthy food such as fruits and vegetables, and they were 4.2 times less likely to be involved in organized sports [71]. Furthermore, OSA severity positively correlated with plasma ghrelin levels [71].

The prevalence of OSA in the US adult population has been estimated to be 24% in men and 9% in women [49] but is increased in severe obesity by up to 93.6% among men and 73.5% among women [50].
OSA is characterized by recurrent episodes of complete or partial obstruction of the upper airway during sleep associated with progressive respiratory effort to overcome the obstruction. These events lead to cortical micro-arousals and oxygen desaturation and overall sleep fragmentation, chronic sleep loss, and increased sympathetic nervous activity [51]. Whether the sleep fragmentation secondary to OSA results in similar pathophysiological mechanisms like sleep deprivation [52] has not been well studied.
Although compelling evidence shows that obesity predisposes to OSA and that losing weight results in OSA improvement, recent studies suggest that OSA itself may cause weight gain. If sleep deprivation appears to be a risk factor for obesity, the sleep fragmentation, overall sleep loss, and daytime sleepiness associated with OSA could similarly favor weight gain, which then further worsens OSA. According to this new paradigm, OSA would cause a complex interaction of behavioral changes, leptin resistance, and increased ghrelin levels leading to decreased physical activity and/or an increase in unhealthier eating habits. A few studies have previously suggested that increased severity of OSA [53,54] and excessive daytime sleepiness [55] are associated with decreased physical activity by self-report. A recent cross-sectional study in a small sample of clinic patients [56] found that increased OSA severity was associated with objectively measured decreased physical activity, after controlling for age, sex, and daytime sleepiness. The small sample size and the study design are obvious limitations and, therefore, this study does not unequivocally prove that OSA leads to decreased physical activity but suggests a mechanism worth exploring.
Alternatively, OSA could directly affect appetite regulation and ultimately result in increased caloric intake. Studies in patients with OSA and similarly obese controls showed that those with OSA had gained weight in the year preceding the diagnosis [57] and had higher leptin levels than expected based on their percentage body fat [5760] suggesting that OSA is associated with greater resistance to the weight-reducing effect of leptin than obesity alone. Multiple intervention studies in adults demonstrated a decrease in leptin levels in patients treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) [58,6165]. Night-time levels of ghrelin are increased in obese patients [66]. One study showed that 2 days of CPAP treatment were sufficient to significantly decrease ghrelin levels in patients with OSA [65].
In addition to causing sleep fragmentation and overall sleep loss, OSA also involves respiratory distress, hypoxia, and hypercapnia with the result of an increase in sympathetic nervous activity. Leptin secretion in OSA could be triggered by hypoxia [67,68], whereas ghrelin release could be related to sympathetic activation [69].
Appetite regulation in OSA and the effect of OSA treatment are still the subject of a recent investigation. Eun et al. [44] showed that surgical treatment of OSA leads to a decrease in leptin levels in the absence of weight change, independently of the severity of OSA. Ursavas et al. [45] measured significantly higher serum ghrelin levels in 55 patients with newly diagnosed OSA compared with nonapneic age-matched and BMI-matched participants, despite no difference in total sleeping time and sleep efficiency. Ghrelin levels correlated with the apnea-hypoxia index (AHI) and with subjective sleepiness. In this study, adipokines such as leptin, adiponectin, and resistin did not differ between the groups.
The published studies have not measured subjective ratings of hunger, food preferences, or food intake. One of the abnormalities of sleep architecture seen in OSA is reduced slow wave sleep (SWS) or deep sleep. Preliminary data showed that experimental suppression of SWS without affecting sleep duration in young healthy adults leads to increased hunger for calorie dense foods with high carbohydrate content particularly in the afternoon and evening hours [70]. In parallel with these early findings in the adults, a very recent study in 59-year-old obese children with and without OSA demonstrate that children with OSA ate 2.2 times more fast food and less healthy food such as fruits and vegetables, and they were 4.2 times less likely to be involved in organized sports [71]. Furthermore, OSA severity positively correlated with plasma ghrelin levels [71].

Severe obesity appears to be associated with marked sleep disturbances, even in individuals who do not have OSA [7275]. Such sleep disturbances may equally predispose severely obese individuals to accumulate a sleep debt and may contribute to the dysregulation of appetite, limit the drive for physical activity, and further compromise weight maintenance.
Cross-sectional studies examining self-reported sleep quality have generally found that worse sleep quality is associated with higher BMI [7678], but the longitudinal studies have been scarce and the results inconsistent [79,80]. A more recent cross-sectional analysis in 400 women participants in the Sleep and Health in Women Study showed that not only sleep duration but also sleep quality, as determined by sleep efficiency and sleep architecture (specifically minutes of SWS, the deep restorative sleep) were inversely related to waist circumference, after adjusting for age, level of physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption and AHI [20]. Such associations were stronger in young women (age <50 years), suggesting that in older age the relationship between sleep quality and obesity may be less robust. The relationship between less time spent in SWS and central obesity could be mediated by a decrease in growth hormone level, which is secreted during SWS. Growth hormone deficiency is associated with visceral obesity, which can be reversed by growth hormone replacement [81,82]. Furthermore, a reduced amount of SWS leads to elevated cortisol levels, which favor central obesity [83].
In the Cardiovascular Health Epidemiology Study, which focused exclusively on AfricanAmericans, an impressive 50% or more of the participants surveyed reported suboptimal sleep duration and low-sleep quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality scale [46]. In a multivariate analysis model, the effect of sleep duration on obesity risk was rather modest, with a significant association between lower sleep quality and increased BMI in women only, and this association was modulated by perceived stress level as measured by the Cohen scale.
A sex difference in the association between poor-sleep quality and obesity risk has been confirmed in a longitudinal study of 7000 Finnish adults, aged 4060 years. In women, sleep problems (difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep) predicted weight gain after 57 years. Moreover, there was a graded effect depending on the frequency of the sleep disturbances [47].
Nordin and Kaplan [48] examined the effect of sleep discontinuity on the development of obesity over a 30-year period in approximately 7000 middle-age adults. Sleep quality was self-reported and assessed by the question how often do you have any trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep? On the basis of the answers compared from the first and last observation, the participants were divided into four categories of sleep continuity, consistently good continuity, consistent discontinuity, impaired continuity (worsened over time), and improved continuity. The main outcome was the risk of transition to and from obesity. Consistent sleep discontinuity was associated with 70% risk of conversion to obesity after adjusting for confounding variables related to demographics, pain, lifestyle, and health including sleep duration. Both consistent sleep discontinuity and impaired sleep continuity reduced the chance for transitioning from obesity, thus increasing the risk of staying obese. The major limitation of the study was that sleep quality and anthropometrics were self-reported and the analysis could not control the presence of a sleep disorder like OSA, which could in part account for the risk of weight gain.",Take the key points and numerical descriptors to,Summarize for a LinkedIn post.,Take the key points and numerical descriptors to Summarize for a LinkedIn post.,"Obesity is associated with sleep disturbances, even in those without obstructive sleep apnea.

These findings highlight the importance of good quality sleep for maintaining a healthy weight, which is especially relevant for seniors who may be more susceptible to sleep disturbances."

Severe obesity appears to be associated with marked sleep disturbances, even in individuals who do not have OSA [7275]. Such sleep disturbances may equally predispose severely obese individuals to accumulate a sleep debt and may contribute to the dysregulation of appetite, limit the drive for physical activity, and further compromise weight maintenance.
Cross-sectional studies examining self-reported sleep quality have generally found that worse sleep quality is associated with higher BMI [7678], but the longitudinal studies have been scarce and the results inconsistent [79,80]. A more recent cross-sectional analysis in 400 women participants in the Sleep and Health in Women Study showed that not only sleep duration but also sleep quality, as determined by sleep efficiency and sleep architecture (specifically minutes of SWS, the deep restorative sleep) were inversely related to waist circumference, after adjusting for age, level of physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption and AHI [20]. Such associations were stronger in young women (age <50 years), suggesting that in older age the relationship between sleep quality and obesity may be less robust. The relationship between less time spent in SWS and central obesity could be mediated by a decrease in growth hormone level, which is secreted during SWS. Growth hormone deficiency is associated with visceral obesity, which can be reversed by growth hormone replacement [81,82]. Furthermore, a reduced amount of SWS leads to elevated cortisol levels, which favor central obesity [83].
In the Cardiovascular Health Epidemiology Study, which focused exclusively on AfricanAmericans, an impressive 50% or more of the participants surveyed reported suboptimal sleep duration and low-sleep quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality scale [46]. In a multivariate analysis model, the effect of sleep duration on obesity risk was rather modest, with a significant association between lower sleep quality and increased BMI in women only, and this association was modulated by perceived stress level as measured by the Cohen scale.
A sex difference in the association between poor-sleep quality and obesity risk has been confirmed in a longitudinal study of 7000 Finnish adults, aged 4060 years. In women, sleep problems (difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep) predicted weight gain after 57 years. Moreover, there was a graded effect depending on the frequency of the sleep disturbances [47].
Nordin and Kaplan [48] examined the effect of sleep discontinuity on the development of obesity over a 30-year period in approximately 7000 middle-age adults. Sleep quality was self-reported and assessed by the question how often do you have any trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep? On the basis of the answers compared from the first and last observation, the participants were divided into four categories of sleep continuity, consistently good continuity, consistent discontinuity, impaired continuity (worsened over time), and improved continuity. The main outcome was the risk of transition to and from obesity. Consistent sleep discontinuity was associated with 70% risk of conversion to obesity after adjusting for confounding variables related to demographics, pain, lifestyle, and health including sleep duration. Both consistent sleep discontinuity and impaired sleep continuity reduced the chance for transitioning from obesity, thus increasing the risk of staying obese. The major limitation of the study was that sleep quality and anthropometrics were self-reported and the analysis could not control the presence of a sleep disorder like OSA, which could in part account for the risk of weight gain.",Take the key points and numerical descriptors to,Summarize for a LinkedIn post.,Take the key points and numerical descriptors to Summarize for a LinkedIn post.,"Summary:

Cross-sectional studies examining self-reported sleep quality have generally found that worse sleep quality is associated with higher BMI [7678], but the longitudinal studies have been scarce and the results inconsistent [79,80]. A more recent cross-sectional analysis in 400 women participants in the Sleep and Health in Women Study showed that not only sleep duration but also sleep quality, as determined by sleep efficiency and sleep architecture (specifically minutes of SWS, the deep restorative sleep) were inversely related to waist circumference, after adjusting for age, level of physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption and AHI [20]. Such associations were stronger in young women (age <50 years), suggesting that in older age the relationship between sleep quality and obesity may be less robust. The relationship between less time spent in SWS and central obesity could be mediated by a decrease in growth hormone level, which is secreted during SWS. Growth hormone deficiency is associated with visceral obesity, which can be reversed by growth hormone replacement [81,82]. Furthermore, a reduced amount of SWS leads to elevated cortisol levels, which favor central obesity [83].
In the Cardiovascular Health Epidemiology Study, which focused exclusively on AfricanAmericans, an impressive 50% or more of the participants surveyed reported suboptimal sleep duration and low-sleep quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality scale [46]. In a multivariate analysis model, the effect of sleep duration on obesity risk was rather modest, with a significant association between lower sleep quality and increased BMI in women only, and this association was modulated by perceived stress level as measured by the Cohen scale.
A sex difference in the association between poor-sleep quality and obesity risk has been confirmed in a longitudinal study of 7000 Finnish adults, aged 4060 years. In women, sleep problems (difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep) predicted weight gain after 57 years. Moreover, there was a graded effect depending on the frequency of the sleep disturbances [47].
Nordin and Kaplan [48] examined the effect of sleep discontinuity on the development of obesity over a 30-year period in approximately 7000 middle-age adults. Sleep quality was self-reported and assessed by the question how often do you have any trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep? On the basis of the answers compared from the first and last observation, the participants were divided into four categories of sleep continuity, consistently good continuity, consistent discontinuity, impaired continuity (worsened over time), and improved continuity. The main outcome was the risk of transition to and from obesity. Consistent sleep discontinuity was associated with 70% risk of conversion to obesity after adjusting for confounding variables related to demographics, pain, lifestyle, and health including sleep duration. Both consistent sleep discontinuity and impaired sleep continuity reduced the chance for transitioning from obesity, thus increasing the risk of staying obese. The major limitation of the study was that sleep quality and anthropometrics were self-reported and the analysis could not control the presence of a sleep disorder like OSA, which could in part account for the risk of weight gain.",Take the key points and numerical descriptors to,Describe the interesting points to your coworker at the water cooler,Take the key points and numerical descriptors to Describe the interesting points to your coworker at the water cooler,"- Severe obesity is associated with marked sleep disturbances which may contribute to dysregulation of appetite, limit drive for physical activity and further compromise weight maintenance.

A recent study found that people who are severely overweight often have trouble sleeping, even if they don't have sleep apnea. Other studies have shown that people who report poor sleep quality tend to have a higher body mass index (BMI). However, this relationship may not be as strong in older people. 

When you don't get enough deep, restful sleep, your body produces more cortisol, which can lead to central obesity. In women, having trouble falling or staying asleep can lead to weight gain over time. And if you have a hard time sleeping consistently, you're more likely to become obese, even after taking into account things like your age, pain levels, lifestyle, and overall health.

Your audience consists of seniors","Severe obesity can cause sleep disturbances, even without obstructive sleep apnea. Studies show that poor sleep quality is linked to higher BMI, especially in women. Women with larger waist circumferences tend to have worse sleep quality. Lack of deep, restorative sleep may contribute to central obesity by decreasing growth hormone levels and increasing cortisol levels. More than half of African-American participants in a study had suboptimal sleep duration and quality, with lower sleep quality linked to increased BMI in women. Long-term sleep problems, such as difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, can lead to weight gain in women. Consistent sleep disruptions increase the risk of obesity and decrease the chance of transitioning from obesity. This information is relevant for seniors who may be experiencing sleep disturbances and weight gain."

Severe obesity appears to be associated with marked sleep disturbances, even in individuals who do not have OSA [7275]. Such sleep disturbances may equally predispose severely obese individuals to accumulate a sleep debt and may contribute to the dysregulation of appetite, limit the drive for physical activity, and further compromise weight maintenance.
Cross-sectional studies examining self-reported sleep quality have generally found that worse sleep quality is associated with higher BMI [7678], but the longitudinal studies have been scarce and the results inconsistent [79,80]. A more recent cross-sectional analysis in 400 women participants in the Sleep and Health in Women Study showed that not only sleep duration but also sleep quality, as determined by sleep efficiency and sleep architecture (specifically minutes of SWS, the deep restorative sleep) were inversely related to waist circumference, after adjusting for age, level of physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption and AHI [20]. Such associations were stronger in young women (age <50 years), suggesting that in older age the relationship between sleep quality and obesity may be less robust. The relationship between less time spent in SWS and central obesity could be mediated by a decrease in growth hormone level, which is secreted during SWS. Growth hormone deficiency is associated with visceral obesity, which can be reversed by growth hormone replacement [81,82]. Furthermore, a reduced amount of SWS leads to elevated cortisol levels, which favor central obesity [83].
In the Cardiovascular Health Epidemiology Study, which focused exclusively on AfricanAmericans, an impressive 50% or more of the participants surveyed reported suboptimal sleep duration and low-sleep quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality scale [46]. In a multivariate analysis model, the effect of sleep duration on obesity risk was rather modest, with a significant association between lower sleep quality and increased BMI in women only, and this association was modulated by perceived stress level as measured by the Cohen scale.
A sex difference in the association between poor-sleep quality and obesity risk has been confirmed in a longitudinal study of 7000 Finnish adults, aged 4060 years. In women, sleep problems (difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep) predicted weight gain after 57 years. Moreover, there was a graded effect depending on the frequency of the sleep disturbances [47].
Nordin and Kaplan [48] examined the effect of sleep discontinuity on the development of obesity over a 30-year period in approximately 7000 middle-age adults. Sleep quality was self-reported and assessed by the question how often do you have any trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep? On the basis of the answers compared from the first and last observation, the participants were divided into four categories of sleep continuity, consistently good continuity, consistent discontinuity, impaired continuity (worsened over time), and improved continuity. The main outcome was the risk of transition to and from obesity. Consistent sleep discontinuity was associated with 70% risk of conversion to obesity after adjusting for confounding variables related to demographics, pain, lifestyle, and health including sleep duration. Both consistent sleep discontinuity and impaired sleep continuity reduced the chance for transitioning from obesity, thus increasing the risk of staying obese. The major limitation of the study was that sleep quality and anthropometrics were self-reported and the analysis could not control the presence of a sleep disorder like OSA, which could in part account for the risk of weight gain.",Take the key points and numerical descriptors to,Describe the interesting points to your coworker at the water cooler,Take the key points and numerical descriptors to Describe the interesting points to your coworker at the water cooler,"Hey, did you know that there's a strong association between poor sleep quality and obesity?

Your audience consists of seniors","💤 Poor sleep quality can lead to obesity, even in individuals without obstructive sleep apnea. Studies show that severe obesity is associated with marked sleep disturbances, which may contribute to weight gain and limit physical activity. Cross-sectional studies report that worse sleep quality is linked to higher BMI, while longitudinal studies have been inconsistent. Sleep quality and duration affect waist circumference, with young women showing a stronger relationship. Growth hormone deficiency, which can be caused by reduced SWS, is linked to visceral obesity. Inconsistent sleep continuity and impaired sleep continuity increase the risk of transitioning to and staying obese. These findings highlight the importance of getting good quality sleep for maintaining a healthy weight, which is especially important for seniors who may already be at risk for obesity-related health issues."
71,Sleep and Obesity article Sleep disturbance and obesity risk section Poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness in the absence of obstructive sleep apnea,1,You are an expert at science communication.,gpt-3.5-turbo,"Sleep and Obesity article Sleep disturbance and obesity risk section Poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness in the absence of obstructive sleep apnea

Severe obesity appears to be associated with marked sleep disturbances, even in individuals who do not have OSA [7275]. Such sleep disturbances may equally predispose severely obese individuals to accumulate a sleep debt and may contribute to the dysregulation of appetite, limit the drive for physical activity, and further compromise weight maintenance.
Cross-sectional studies examining self-reported sleep quality have generally found that worse sleep quality is associated with higher BMI [7678], but the longitudinal studies have been scarce and the results inconsistent [79,80]. A more recent cross-sectional analysis in 400 women participants in the Sleep and Health in Women Study showed that not only sleep duration but also sleep quality, as determined by sleep efficiency and sleep architecture (specifically minutes of SWS, the deep restorative sleep) were inversely related to waist circumference, after adjusting for age, level of physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption and AHI [20]. Such associations were stronger in young women (age <50 years), suggesting that in older age the relationship between sleep quality and obesity may be less robust. The relationship between less time spent in SWS and central obesity could be mediated by a decrease in growth hormone level, which is secreted during SWS. Growth hormone deficiency is associated with visceral obesity, which can be reversed by growth hormone replacement [81,82]. Furthermore, a reduced amount of SWS leads to elevated cortisol levels, which favor central obesity [83].
In the Cardiovascular Health Epidemiology Study, which focused exclusively on AfricanAmericans, an impressive 50% or more of the participants surveyed reported suboptimal sleep duration and low-sleep quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality scale [46]. In a multivariate analysis model, the effect of sleep duration on obesity risk was rather modest, with a significant association between lower sleep quality and increased BMI in women only, and this association was modulated by perceived stress level as measured by the Cohen scale.
A sex difference in the association between poor-sleep quality and obesity risk has been confirmed in a longitudinal study of 7000 Finnish adults, aged 4060 years. In women, sleep problems (difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep) predicted weight gain after 57 years. Moreover, there was a graded effect depending on the frequency of the sleep disturbances [47].
Nordin and Kaplan [48] examined the effect of sleep discontinuity on the development of obesity over a 30-year period in approximately 7000 middle-age adults. Sleep quality was self-reported and assessed by the question how often do you have any trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep? On the basis of the answers compared from the first and last observation, the participants were divided into four categories of sleep continuity, consistently good continuity, consistent discontinuity, impaired continuity (worsened over time), and improved continuity. The main outcome was the risk of transition to and from obesity. Consistent sleep discontinuity was associated with 70% risk of conversion to obesity after adjusting for confounding variables related to demographics, pain, lifestyle, and health including sleep duration. Both consistent sleep discontinuity and impaired sleep continuity reduced the chance for transitioning from obesity, thus increasing the risk of staying obese. The major limitation of the study was that sleep quality and anthropometrics were self-reported and the analysis could not control the presence of a sleep disorder like OSA, which could in part account for the risk of weight gain.",Take the key points and numerical descriptors to,Create an Instagram post without hashtags.,Take the key points and numerical descriptors to Create an Instagram post without hashtags.,"Sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness may contribute to obesity, even without obstructive sleep apnea.

Studies have shown that poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness can lead to dysregulation of appetite and limit the drive for physical activity, thereby compromising weight maintenance.

Severe obesity appears to be associated with marked sleep disturbances, even in individuals who do not have OSA [7275]. Such sleep disturbances may equally predispose severely obese individuals to accumulate a sleep debt and may contribute to the dysregulation of appetite, limit the drive for physical activity, and further compromise weight maintenance.
Cross-sectional studies examining self-reported sleep quality have generally found that worse sleep quality is associated with higher BMI [7678], but the longitudinal studies have been scarce and the results inconsistent [79,80]. A more recent cross-sectional analysis in 400 women participants in the Sleep and Health in Women Study showed that not only sleep duration but also sleep quality, as determined by sleep efficiency and sleep architecture (specifically minutes of SWS, the deep restorative sleep) were inversely related to waist circumference, after adjusting for age, level of physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption and AHI [20]. Such associations were stronger in young women (age <50 years), suggesting that in older age the relationship between sleep quality and obesity may be less robust. The relationship between less time spent in SWS and central obesity could be mediated by a decrease in growth hormone level, which is secreted during SWS. Growth hormone deficiency is associated with visceral obesity, which can be reversed by growth hormone replacement [81,82]. Furthermore, a reduced amount of SWS leads to elevated cortisol levels, which favor central obesity [83].
In the Cardiovascular Health Epidemiology Study, which focused exclusively on AfricanAmericans, an impressive 50% or more of the participants surveyed reported suboptimal sleep duration and low-sleep quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality scale [46]. In a multivariate analysis model, the effect of sleep duration on obesity risk was rather modest, with a significant association between lower sleep quality and increased BMI in women only, and this association was modulated by perceived stress level as measured by the Cohen scale.
A sex difference in the association between poor-sleep quality and obesity risk has been confirmed in a longitudinal study of 7000 Finnish adults, aged 4060 years. In women, sleep problems (difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep) predicted weight gain after 57 years. Moreover, there was a graded effect depending on the frequency of the sleep disturbances [47].
Nordin and Kaplan [48] examined the effect of sleep discontinuity on the development of obesity over a 30-year period in approximately 7000 middle-age adults. Sleep quality was self-reported and assessed by the question how often do you have any trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep? On the basis of the answers compared from the first and last observation, the participants were divided into four categories of sleep continuity, consistently good continuity, consistent discontinuity, impaired continuity (worsened over time), and improved continuity. The main outcome was the risk of transition to and from obesity. Consistent sleep discontinuity was associated with 70% risk of conversion to obesity after adjusting for confounding variables related to demographics, pain, lifestyle, and health including sleep duration. Both consistent sleep discontinuity and impaired sleep continuity reduced the chance for transitioning from obesity, thus increasing the risk of staying obese. The major limitation of the study was that sleep quality and anthropometrics were self-reported and the analysis could not control the presence of a sleep disorder like OSA, which could in part account for the risk of weight gain.",Take the key points and numerical descriptors to,Create an Instagram post without hashtags.,Take the key points and numerical descriptors to Create an Instagram post without hashtags.,"Sleep quality is inversely related to obesity, with worse sleep quality leading to higher BMI. Sleep deprivation can limit the drive for physical activity, dysregulate appetite, and compromise weight maintenance. Sleep architecture, specifically the amount of deep restorative sleep (SWS), is also inversely related to waist circumference. Women under 50 are more susceptible to the negative effects of poor sleep quality on obesity. Sleep discontinuity is associated with a 70% increased risk of conversion to obesity and reduces the chance of transitioning from obesity. #ScienceCommunication #SleepAndObesity",,,,1,people without a science background,"If needed, rewrite the text using terms appropriate for the audience.

Your audience is for people without a science background","Sleep quality affects weight, with worse sleep leading to higher body weight. Not getting enough sleep can make it harder to be active and control appetite, which can make it harder to maintain a healthy weight. The way we sleep, specifically the amount of deep restorative sleep we get, is also related to our waist size. Women under 50 are more affected by poor sleep quality and weight gain. Not sleeping well is linked to a higher risk of becoming obese and makes it harder to lose weight. #ScienceCommunication #SleepAndObesity",,,,"Rewrite this summary to include a statement of how it is relevant for the audience.
