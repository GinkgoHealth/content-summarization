    "text1 = \"\"\"The Impact of Sleep Duration on Performance Among Competitive Athletes: A Systematic Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "DISCUSSION \n",
    "This literature review, although diverse in the range of sports, methods, and outcomes studied, provides several stylized facts that can inform sleep research and competitive athletes. First, out of all the published studies we reviewed, none found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome. All of the results reviewed showed that either the increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Note that among studies reporting significant positive results, effect sizes varied considerably (Tables 2-4), likely due to differences in the duration of sleep deprivation/extension experienced as well as differences in outcome measures. Second, when considering the aerobic and anaerobic characteristics of sports, it seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. For instance, Mejri et al40 found that depriving competitive taekwondo boxers of a mere 3 to 4 hours of sleep significantly impaired performance on the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test. By contrast, Blumert et al33 employed a relatively severe sleep deprivation protocol by depriving 9 national-caliber collegiate weightlifters of 24 hours of sleep and yet failed to identify adverse effects on any of the various weightlifting exercises examined. Relatedly, for both endurance and explosive, power-based exercises, it has been well documented that sleep deprivation is associated with increased perceived effort.56–58 Still, the relationship between perceived effort and objective performance has not been widely validated and is a topic for future investigation. Third, of the studies that measured outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills, most find benefits of sleep on performance. Tennis serving accuracy and basketball shooting were both improved by long-term sleep extension interventions,35,39 and tennis serving accuracy suffered when players were deprived of 2 to 2.5 hours of sleep at the beginning of the preceding night.37 Regarding studies conducted in players of team sports that incorporated tactics and decision-based outcomes to a broader extent, soccer as well as rugby players exhibited performance deficits after nights of decreased sleep duration.34 These results are in line with other literature demonstrating clear neurocognitive deficits in the setting of inadequate sleep in the general population, reviewed thoroughly elsewhere.59,60 Finally, when looking at the methodologies of the experimental studies, we found that the studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Interestingly although most acute sleep interventions involved sleep deprivation and yielded positive results, there were inconsistent results among the 2 acute sleep extension studies.15,38 Conversely, the majority of longer-term sleep intervention studies involved sleep extension and showed positive results.35,39,49 Taken together, these findings suggest that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. On the other hand, more research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. The reliability and precision of the various measurements may present challenges in interpretation of these studies. For example, “maximal” voluntary muscle contraction and voluntarily chosen training load are variable across subjects.61,62 On the other hand, “running economy,” the oxygen cost associated with a given running velocity, has low variability among highly trained runners and is significantly correlated with cardiorespiratory parameters used to assess aerobic capacity.63 A meta-analysis of the reliability of various measures of muscle power previously identified that field running tests tended to be more reliable than treadmill running tests, tests lasting up to 1 minute tended to be more reliable than those lasting greater than 1 minute (likely due to increased variability in muscle movement and limb positioning), and isokinetic tests tended to be more reliable when measuring muscle extension versus flexion.62 Somewhat reassuringly in the context of the present review, this metaanalysis also found that measurements taken from athletes were more reliable than those taken from non-athlete subjects. With respect to the validity of outcome measures reported as performance indicators, the nature of the sport (eg, team vs individual) may be an important determinant of whether what is measured in the laboratory translates to the actual game. For instance, for team-based sports requiring complex game structure such as soccer, measures of muscle force production or running speed are likely insufficient to provide an accurate assessment of in-game performance, although they may be helpful in making gross approximations and predictions.64 Of course, actual performance metrics from real or simulated games would be the ideal outcomes to quantify for such sports in future investigations. More specifically, for performance outcomes included in the current review, the following have been independently validated and shown to be reliable measures of athletic performance: Yo-Yo intermittent recovery (YYIR) test, isometric muscle contraction, squat, countermovement jump, free sthrow basketball shooting, tennis serving, shuttle-running tests, and Wingate test.42–48 In Table 1, we have indicated studies employing previously validated and reliable metrics of objective performance with asterisks (as per the criteria discussed above). Still, more work will be required to further validate the various performance outcomes measured in the studies reviewed in the present work, especially those involving complex, team-based measures such as composite game performance scores and passing accuracy. Likewise, given the high inter-individual variability of sleep variables used across the included studies, these metrics will also require further investigation to determine their precision and reliability as predictors of athletic performance. Importantly, we chose to require at least one objective performance measure among our inclusion criteria. The previous work relying on self-perceived performance, although informative in understanding the potential effect of sleep loss or gain on sports psychology,15 may not accurately reflect actual performance, as was the goal of the present work. However, under certain circumstances, self-perceived pre-game wellness (including self-reported sleep quality) may be predictive of objective in-game performance.65 More research will be needed to assess the validity of playerreported performance and objective performance, especially when athletes exhibit compromised sleep. Several experimental studies are particularly illustrative of the various trends in the results we have just outlined. To address the question of whether one night of sleep extension would be sufficient to improve various fitness indices among semi-professional soccer players, Fullagar et al15 tested a sleep hygiene intervention. The investigators implemented a sleep hygiene strategy (SHS) designed to maximize sleep duration and limit stimulation before bedtime to test whether this would be sufficient to improve either anaerobic (jumping height and force production) or aerobic endurance (Yo–Yo intermittent recovery level 2, YYIR2) performance after latenight soccer matches. Implementing a randomized design, they assigned 20 participants to follow either their normal post-match sleep routine [non-SHS (NSHS)] or a SHS involving early dimming of lights and lights out by midnight, cool room temperature, and no technology or light stimulation for 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. Actigraphy was used to measure sleep patterns, and sleep diary was used for subjective recall of sleep quality. Despite finding that those assigned to the SHS indeed exhibited increased sleep duration after the night match relative to those in the NSHS group, the investigators failed to identify any improvements in countermovement jump height, countermovement jump force production, or YYIR2 performance, tested over the following 2 days. On the other hand, as we have discussed, studies of acute sleep deprivation, especially those measuring technical performance outcomes, tended to yield positive results. Given that sleep is often disrupted the night before athletic competition,66 athletes involved in sports requiring these types of skills are likely to be particularly sensitive to sleep manipulations and thus should be counseled regarding the importance of sleep for game performance. Relatedly, chronic sleep extension studies have demonstrated significant benefits to athletes.35,49 Thus, strategies to improve sleep not only the night before an important sports event but also in the weeks leading up to this event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance. In this review, we have summarized and synthesized recent findings in the realm of sports and sleep science. One of the challenges of conducting such a literature review is that the study methodologies vary a great deal, as do the individual sports, making comparisons of effects and magnitudes of effect sizes across studies difficult. Additionally, unlike many studies of athletic performance and sleep conducted in nonathletes and recreational sports players, studies incorporating high-level competitors are limited, especially those implementing experimental approaches. Even among the best-controlled studies, sample sizes are small and sleep measurements vary considerably, with some studies measuring sleep duration objectively through polysomnography or actigraphy and others relying on self-report. All of these factors limit the scope of the conclusions that can be drawn. Nevertheless, they do provide valuable information about when sleep does or particularly when sleep does not seem to play a key role in influencing performance. Future research may seek to use larger sample sizes and standardize tests of athletic performance in order to identify optimal sleep standards, in addition to standardizing sleep metrics and incorporating more objective sleep data. In particular, here we focused on studies investigating sleep duration, although sleep timing is likely to be a relevant factor as well. As sleep onset and wake time have previously been shown to influence performance and recovery,5 future studies should aim to incorporate this information. Given these suggestions for improving future research, there are many opportunities for innovative research on this topic. One area in particular may be about how generalizable these findings are to other sports. Given the wide range of methodologies and used in these studies, another research goal would be to harmonize measures across studies and conduct a meta-analysis. Another area to investigate is trade-offs between wake time activities (eg, athletic practice) and sleep. For example, is it beneficial for swimmers to practice early in the morning even at the expense of their sleep? Research also should seek to investigate the mechanisms by which aerobic, tactical, and technical performance attributes may be preferentially sensitive to changes in sleep patterns. One limitation of the present work is that although the number of hours and/or nights of sleep interventions across studies varied, sleep duration was only measured the night before performance assessment. Thus, in order to obtain a more complete picture of sleep quantity and quality, future research should aim to measure sleep across the entire study period. Another limitation is that few of the studies examined explicitly the relationship between subjective sleep quality and performance, especially using validated sleep quality questionnaires such as the PSQI and ESS. Thus, this remains an open question that will be important to be investigated in the future. Once all these data are gathered, feasible and effective interventions should be developed, implemented, and evaluated to improve the sleep health and optimal performance of athletes. In conclusion, the importance of sleep for professional athletes to achieve high performance varies by the cognitive and physical demands of the sport. However, because most sports require integration of aerobic fitness, tactical skills, and technical skills, competitive athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration.  \n",

    "text2 = \"\"\"Food craving, cortisol and ghrelin responses in modeling highly palatable snack intake in the laboratory\n",
    "\n",
    "DISCUSSION\n",
    "This preliminary study is the first to directly compare the effects of both food cue and stress exposure on HP food craving and HP food intake in a 3-day human laboratory experiment conducted within a controlled hospital-based setting with healthy community adults. As both the ubiquitous HP food environment and stressors are known to increase HP food intake and obesity risk, a direct comparison of these contexts could identify similar and differential processes that may underlie food motivation and intake. As hypothesized, and similar to our previous work in addiction [18], we found that exposure to both personal food cues and to personal stressors relative to a neutral relaxing control cue resulted in increases in HP food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods in a standardized Food Snack Test (FST), but with differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups. Furthermore, we found that increased food craving in these contexts was highly associated with subsequent amounts of HP food snack intake. Finally, both ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. Together, these results support the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.\n",
    "Exposure to food cue imagery led to significant increases in HP food craving prior to the presentation of the FST at the pre-snack timepoint in both lean and OW individuals. Moreover, food cue-related increases in food craving predicted significant increases in HP snack intake across both lean and OW individuals. These data are consistent with a significant literature indicating that rewarding stimuli and their related contexts increase motivation and wanting of rewarding stimuli via conditioning and/or incentive salience mechanisms [4, 20, 42]. Also, a number of basic science and human neuroimaging studies have shown that food cue stimulus exposure increases food craving and activate brain reward and motivation regions [4, 7-11, 18, 43, 44]. Current findings further indicate that such food cue-related increases in HP food craving promote HP snack intake with greater intake of HP foods in the food cue context relative to the neutral relaxing contexts across individuals. These data validate the real-world contexts of advertising of HP foods to promote greater sales and intake of HP foods.\n",
    "In contrast, we found a differential impact of stress on HP food craving and intake by BMI group where stress significantly increased food craving relative to the neutral condition, but only in the overweight and not the lean group. Furthermore, stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group, suggesting that food motivational processes may be relevant in identifying those who are vulnerable to stress-induced eating. Previous laboratory studies have shown mixed results with some showing stress increasing food intake [17, 24], but others reporting no consistent increases in intake [23, 45]. While the methodology has varied across these studies, current findings suggest the need for direct comparison of BMI groups and consideration of weight-related adaptations in assessing stress effects on HP food motivation and intake. Current findings are also supported by a growing literature suggesting that BMI-related alterations impact not only metabolic hormones but also stress and reward processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake [18, 20, 44]. Together our findings on food cue- and stress- related effects on HP food motivation and intake suggests differential effects by BMI, that may in turn, point to different mechanisms that may drive weight gain and obesity risk in individuals who are lean versus those who are overweight.\n",
    "Our findings also show differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin responses and their contribution to HP food motivation and intake. Stress and food cue exposure increased ghrelin responses, but significantly for the OW and not the LN group. Furthermore, only in the OW group was stress-induced ghrelin increases significantly associated with both HP food craving and subsequent HP food intake. While ghrelin has well known homeostatic effects on feeding function [46, 47], recent focus has been on its role in both stress and mood regulation as well as in hedonically motivated feeding behavior, partially via its effects on mesolimbic reward circuits [37, 48]. Findings indicate that ghrelin can shift preferences to high palatable foods and increase the motivational aspects of food reward [48]. Ghrelin is also known to increase with stress and is involved in regulating anxiety and mood (36, 49-51). Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that ghrelin administration increases the neural response to food pictures in areas associated with hedonic eating (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and ventral tegmental area) [52]. Additionally, there is growing evidence that feed-forward circuitry between stress and food reward maybe partly mediated by ghrelin [52, 53]. In the current study, as the effects were specific to the OW group, they suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions.\n",
    "Finally, our findings also showed differential effects of cortisol responses to stress and food cue exposure. Notably, there was a significant increase in cortisol in the food cue relative to the neutral condition that was due to significant increases in cortisol in the lean group and not so in the OW group. Furthermore, food cue-related increases in cortisol was associated with greater food cue-related HP craving, suggesting a role for cortisol in food motivation. While glucocorticoids are often associated with the stress response, they are also known to play an important role in energy intake and regulation. Cortisol increases have been noted with intake of specific macronutrients, including carbohydrates, fats and proteins in animals and humans [6, 54], with the source of cortisol increases to be via both adrenal and extra-adrenal production [54]. Furthermore, in our previous neuroimaging study, increases in cortisol during a mild hypoglycemic state was associated with greater activation of brain reward regions that promoted greater food craving [44]. Together, this previous research supports current findings of the association between greater cortisol responses to food cue exposure with food cue-induced HP food craving.\n",
    "We did not see an overall significant increase in cortisol during stress exposure, but this was largely due to a lack of response in the OW group. Remarkably, the OW group showed blunted cortisol responses during stress and food cue relative to neutral conditions. This finding is consistent with growing evidence of blunted cortisol and autonomic responses to stress challenge in people who are OW or obese, along with altered autonomic and peripheral catecholamine responses to stress challenge in those weight groups [18, 21-25, 55]. HPA axis adaptations with low cortisol awakening responses have been reported in higher BMI groups, along with blunted responses to stress and reduced dopamine activity [20, 56]. Thus, the current findings of lack of cortisol increases in the OW group leads one to speculate that such HPA axis adaptations may contribute to higher HP food craving and intake in food cue and in stress contexts. However, this is speculation and would need further testing in future studies.\n",
    "Several limitations of the current study need to be considered. First, the sample size was small and thus the findings are preliminary and need further validation. Also, due to the small sample size, sex differences and differential responses within the overweight groups were not assessed. It is possible that men and women differ in their food motivation and intake responses in food cue and stress contexts as shown in previous work [26,27]. Also, continuous assessment of BMI rather than arbitrary cutoffs for individuals in the lean, overweight and obese BMI range may provide greater sensitivity in assessing weight related adaptations. Thus, research with larger samples is required to replicate current findings and address these issues. Finally, as this study was conducted while participants were in a hospital, it is not clear whether the findings are generalizable to an outpatient experimental context or to real world food motivation and intake settings. On the other hand, as food cues and stress are among the most common contexts in which overeating of HP foods occur in the real world, the current study presents a well-controlled experimental model to study the biobehavioral processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake of highly palatable foods. Evidence of HP food motivation and increased snacking in these contexts is consistent with reports of obesogenic environments promoting increased HP food intake and weight gain in the real world. Furthermore, positive associations of HP food craving and intake by total ghrelin and cortisol responses suggests a role for metabolic and neuroendocrine adaptations in increased HP food motivation and intake.\n",

The sample size was small, but the findings are intriguing and call for further research in this area.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Impact of Sleep Duration on Performance Among Competitive Athletes: A Systematic Literature Review\\n\\nDISCUSSION \\nThis literature review, although diverse in the range of sports, methods, and outcomes studied, provides several stylized facts that can inform sleep research and competitive athletes. First, out of all the published studies we reviewed, none found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome. All of the results reviewed showed that either the increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Note that among studies reporting significant positive results, effect sizes varied considerably (Tables 2-4), likely due to differences in the duration of sleep deprivation/extension experienced as well as differences in outcome measures. Second, when considering the aerobic and anaerobic characteristics of sports, it seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. For instance, Mejri et al40 found that depriving competitive taekwondo boxers of a mere 3 to 4 hours of sleep significantly impaired performance on the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test. By contrast, Blumert et al33 employed a relatively severe sleep deprivation protocol by depriving 9 national-caliber collegiate weightlifters of 24 hours of sleep and yet failed to identify adverse effects on any of the various weightlifting exercises examined. Relatedly, for both endurance and explosive, power-based exercises, it has been well documented that sleep deprivation is associated with increased perceived effort.56–58 Still, the relationship between perceived effort and objective performance has not been widely validated and is a topic for future investigation. Third, of the studies that measured outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills, most find benefits of sleep on performance. Tennis serving accuracy and basketball shooting were both improved by long-term sleep extension interventions,35,39 and tennis serving accuracy suffered when players were deprived of 2 to 2.5 hours of sleep at the beginning of the preceding night.37 Regarding studies conducted in players of team sports that incorporated tactics and decision-based outcomes to a broader extent, soccer as well as rugby players exhibited performance deficits after nights of decreased sleep duration.34 These results are in line with other literature demonstrating clear neurocognitive deficits in the setting of inadequate sleep in the general population, reviewed thoroughly elsewhere.59,60 Finally, when looking at the methodologies of the experimental studies, we found that the studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Interestingly although most acute sleep interventions involved sleep deprivation and yielded positive results, there were inconsistent results among the 2 acute sleep extension studies.15,38 Conversely, the majority of longer-term sleep intervention studies involved sleep extension and showed positive results.35,39,49 Taken together, these findings suggest that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. On the other hand, more research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. The reliability and precision of the various measurements may present challenges in interpretation of these studies. For example, “maximal” voluntary muscle contraction and voluntarily chosen training load are variable across subjects.61,62 On the other hand, “running economy,” the oxygen cost associated with a given running velocity, has low variability among highly trained runners and is significantly correlated with cardiorespiratory parameters used to assess aerobic capacity.63 A meta-analysis of the reliability of various measures of muscle power previously identified that field running tests tended to be more reliable than treadmill running tests, tests lasting up to 1 minute tended to be more reliable than those lasting greater than 1 minute (likely due to increased variability in muscle movement and limb positioning), and isokinetic tests tended to be more reliable when measuring muscle extension versus flexion.62 Somewhat reassuringly in the context of the present review, this metaanalysis also found that measurements taken from athletes were more reliable than those taken from non-athlete subjects. With respect to the validity of outcome measures reported as performance indicators, the nature of the sport (eg, team vs individual) may be an important determinant of whether what is measured in the laboratory translates to the actual game. For instance, for team-based sports requiring complex game structure such as soccer, measures of muscle force production or running speed are likely insufficient to provide an accurate assessment of in-game performance, although they may be helpful in making gross approximations and predictions.64 Of course, actual performance metrics from real or simulated games would be the ideal outcomes to quantify for such sports in future investigations. More specifically, for performance outcomes included in the current review, the following have been independently validated and shown to be reliable measures of athletic performance: Yo-Yo intermittent recovery (YYIR) test, isometric muscle contraction, squat, countermovement jump, free sthrow basketball shooting, tennis serving, shuttle-running tests, and Wingate test.42–48 In Table 1, we have indicated studies employing previously validated and reliable metrics of objective performance with asterisks (as per the criteria discussed above). Still, more work will be required to further validate the various performance outcomes measured in the studies reviewed in the present work, especially those involving complex, team-based measures such as composite game performance scores and passing accuracy. Likewise, given the high inter-individual variability of sleep variables used across the included studies, these metrics will also require further investigation to determine their precision and reliability as predictors of athletic performance. Importantly, we chose to require at least one objective performance measure among our inclusion criteria. The previous work relying on self-perceived performance, although informative in understanding the potential effect of sleep loss or gain on sports psychology,15 may not accurately reflect actual performance, as was the goal of the present work. However, under certain circumstances, self-perceived pre-game wellness (including self-reported sleep quality) may be predictive of objective in-game performance.65 More research will be needed to assess the validity of playerreported performance and objective performance, especially when athletes exhibit compromised sleep. Several experimental studies are particularly illustrative of the various trends in the results we have just outlined. To address the question of whether one night of sleep extension would be sufficient to improve various fitness indices among semi-professional soccer players, Fullagar et al15 tested a sleep hygiene intervention. The investigators implemented a sleep hygiene strategy (SHS) designed to maximize sleep duration and limit stimulation before bedtime to test whether this would be sufficient to improve either anaerobic (jumping height and force production) or aerobic endurance (Yo–Yo intermittent recovery level 2, YYIR2) performance after latenight soccer matches. Implementing a randomized design, they assigned 20 participants to follow either their normal post-match sleep routine [non-SHS (NSHS)] or a SHS involving early dimming of lights and lights out by midnight, cool room temperature, and no technology or light stimulation for 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. Actigraphy was used to measure sleep patterns, and sleep diary was used for subjective recall of sleep quality. Despite finding that those assigned to the SHS indeed exhibited increased sleep duration after the night match relative to those in the NSHS group, the investigators failed to identify any improvements in countermovement jump height, countermovement jump force production, or YYIR2 performance, tested over the following 2 days. On the other hand, as we have discussed, studies of acute sleep deprivation, especially those measuring technical performance outcomes, tended to yield positive results. Given that sleep is often disrupted the night before athletic competition,66 athletes involved in sports requiring these types of skills are likely to be particularly sensitive to sleep manipulations and thus should be counseled regarding the importance of sleep for game performance. Relatedly, chronic sleep extension studies have demonstrated significant benefits to athletes.35,49 Thus, strategies to improve sleep not only the night before an important sports event but also in the weeks leading up to this event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance. In this review, we have summarized and synthesized recent findings in the realm of sports and sleep science. One of the challenges of conducting such a literature review is that the study methodologies vary a great deal, as do the individual sports, making comparisons of effects and magnitudes of effect sizes across studies difficult. Additionally, unlike many studies of athletic performance and sleep conducted in nonathletes and recreational sports players, studies incorporating high-level competitors are limited, especially those implementing experimental approaches. Even among the best-controlled studies, sample sizes are small and sleep measurements vary considerably, with some studies measuring sleep duration objectively through polysomnography or actigraphy and others relying on self-report. All of these factors limit the scope of the conclusions that can be drawn. Nevertheless, they do provide valuable information about when sleep does or particularly when sleep does not seem to play a key role in influencing performance. Future research may seek to use larger sample sizes and standardize tests of athletic performance in order to identify optimal sleep standards, in addition to standardizing sleep metrics and incorporating more objective sleep data. In particular, here we focused on studies investigating sleep duration, although sleep timing is likely to be a relevant factor as well. As sleep onset and wake time have previously been shown to influence performance and recovery,5 future studies should aim to incorporate this information. Given these suggestions for improving future research, there are many opportunities for innovative research on this topic. One area in particular may be about how generalizable these findings are to other sports. Given the wide range of methodologies and used in these studies, another research goal would be to harmonize measures across studies and conduct a meta-analysis. Another area to investigate is trade-offs between wake time activities (eg, athletic practice) and sleep. For example, is it beneficial for swimmers to practice early in the morning even at the expense of their sleep? Research also should seek to investigate the mechanisms by which aerobic, tactical, and technical performance attributes may be preferentially sensitive to changes in sleep patterns. One limitation of the present work is that although the number of hours and/or nights of sleep interventions across studies varied, sleep duration was only measured the night before performance assessment. Thus, in order to obtain a more complete picture of sleep quantity and quality, future research should aim to measure sleep across the entire study period. Another limitation is that few of the studies examined explicitly the relationship between subjective sleep quality and performance, especially using validated sleep quality questionnaires such as the PSQI and ESS. Thus, this remains an open question that will be important to be investigated in the future. Once all these data are gathered, feasible and effective interventions should be developed, implemented, and evaluated to improve the sleep health and optimal performance of athletes. In conclusion, the importance of sleep for professional athletes to achieve high performance varies by the cognitive and physical demands of the sport. However, because most sports require integration of aerobic fitness, tactical skills, and technical skills, competitive athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration.  \\n</td>\n",

With respect to the validity of outcome measures reported as performance indicators, the nature of the sport (eg, team vs individual) may be an important determinant of whether what is measured in the laboratory translates to the actual game. For instance, for team-based sports requiring complex game structure such as soccer, measures of muscle force production or running speed are likely insufficient to provide an accurate assessment of in-game performance, although they may be helpful in making gross approximations and predictions.64 Of course, actual performance metrics from real or simulated games would be the ideal outcomes to quantify for such sports in future investigations. More specifically, for performance outcomes included in the current review, the following have been independently validated and shown to be reliable measures of athletic performance: Yo-Yo intermittent recovery (YYIR) test, isometric muscle contraction, squat, countermovement jump, free sthrow basketball shooting, tennis serving, shuttle-running tests, and Wingate test.42–48 In Table 1, we have indicated studies employing previously validated and reliable metrics of objective performance with asterisks (as per the criteria discussed above). Still, more work will be required to further validate the various performance outcomes measured in the studies reviewed in the present work, especially those involving complex, team-based measures such as composite game performance scores and passing accuracy. Likewise, given the high inter-individual variability of sleep variables used across the included studies, these metrics will also require further investigation to determine their precision and reliability as predictors of athletic performance. Importantly, we chose to require at least one objective performance measure among our inclusion criteria. The previous work relying on self-perceived performance, although informative in understanding the potential effect of sleep loss or gain on sports psychology,15 may not accurately reflect actual performance, as was the goal of the present work. However, under certain circumstances, self-perceived pre-game wellness (including self-reported sleep quality) may be predictive of objective in-game performance.65 More research will be needed to assess the validity of playerreported performance and objective performance, especially when athletes exhibit compromised sleep. Several experimental studies are particularly illustrative of the various trends in the results we have just outlined. To address the question of whether one night of sleep extension would be sufficient to improve various fitness indices among semi-professional soccer players, Fullagar et al15 tested a sleep hygiene intervention. The investigators implemented a sleep hygiene strategy (SHS) designed to maximize sleep duration and limit stimulation before bedtime to test whether this would be sufficient to improve either anaerobic (jumping height and force production) or aerobic endurance (Yo–Yo intermittent recovery level 2, YYIR2) performance after latenight soccer matches. Implementing a randomized design, they assigned 20 participants to follow either their normal post-match sleep routine [non-SHS (NSHS)] or a SHS involving early dimming of lights and lights out by midnight, cool room temperature, and no technology or light stimulation for 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. Actigraphy was used to measure sleep patterns, and sleep diary was used for subjective recall of sleep quality. Despite finding that those assigned to the SHS indeed exhibited increased sleep duration after the night match relative to those in the NSHS group, the investigators failed to identify any improvements in countermovement jump height, countermovement jump force production, or YYIR2 performance, tested over the following 2 days. On the other hand, as we have discussed, studies of acute sleep deprivation, especially those measuring technical performance outcomes, tended to yield positive results. Given that sleep is often disrupted the night before athletic competition,66 athletes involved in sports requiring these types of skills are likely to be particularly sensitive to sleep manipulations and thus should be counseled regarding the importance of sleep for game performance. Relatedly, chronic sleep extension studies have demonstrated significant benefits to athletes.35,49 Thus, strategies to improve sleep not only the night before an important sports event but also in the weeks leading up to this event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance. In this review, we have summarized and synthesized recent findings in the realm of sports and sleep science. One of the challenges of conducting such a literature review is that the study methodologies vary a great deal, as do the individual sports, making comparisons of effects and magnitudes of effect sizes across studies difficult. Additionally, unlike many studies of athletic performance and sleep conducted in nonathletes and recreational sports players, studies incorporating high-level competitors are limited, especially those implementing experimental approaches. Even among the best-controlled studies, sample sizes are small and sleep measurements vary considerably, with some studies measuring sleep duration objectively through polysomnography or actigraphy and others relying on self-report. All of these factors limit the scope of the conclusions that can be drawn. Nevertheless, they do provide valuable information about when sleep does or particularly when sleep does not seem to play a key role in influencing performance. Future research may seek to use larger sample sizes and standardize tests of athletic performance in order to identify optimal sleep standards, in addition to standardizing sleep metrics and incorporating more objective sleep data. In particular, here we focused on studies investigating sleep duration, although sleep timing is likely to be a relevant factor as well. As sleep onset and wake time have previously been shown to influence performance and recovery,5 future studies should aim to incorporate this information. Given these suggestions for improving future research, there are many opportunities for innovative research on this topic. One area in particular may be about how generalizable these findings are to other sports. Given the wide range of methodologies and used in these studies, another research goal would be to harmonize measures across studies and conduct a meta-analysis. Another area to investigate is trade-offs between wake time activities (eg, athletic practice) and sleep. For example, is it beneficial for swimmers to practice early in the morning even at the expense of their sleep? Research also should seek to investigate the mechanisms by which aerobic, tactical, and technical performance attributes may be preferentially sensitive to changes in sleep patterns. One limitation of the present work is that although the number of hours and/or nights of sleep interventions across studies varied, sleep duration was only measured the night before performance assessment. Thus, in order to obtain a more complete picture of sleep quantity and quality, future research should aim to measure sleep across the entire study period. Another limitation is that few of the studies examined explicitly the relationship between subjective sleep quality and performance, especially using validated sleep quality questionnaires such as the PSQI and ESS. Thus, this remains an open question that will be important to be investigated in the future. Once all these data are gathered, feasible and effective interventions should be developed, implemented, and evaluated to improve the sleep health and optimal performance of athletes. In conclusion, the importance of sleep for professional athletes to achieve high performance varies by the cognitive and physical demands of the sport. However, because most sports require integration of aerobic fitness, tactical skills, and technical skills, competitive athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration.  \\n</td>\n",
       "      <td>Food craving, cortisol and ghrelin responses in modeling highly palatable snack intake in the laboratory\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nThis preliminary study is the first to directly compare the effects of both food cue and stress exposure on HP food craving and HP food intake in a 3-day human laboratory experiment conducted within a controlled hospital-based setting with healthy community adults. As both the ubiquitous HP food environment and stressors are known to increase HP food intake and obesity risk, a direct comparison of these contexts could identify similar and differential processes that may underlie food motivation and intake. As hypothesized, and similar to our previous work in addiction [18], we found that exposure to both personal food cues and to personal stressors relative to a neutral relaxing control cue resulted in increases in HP food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods in a standardized Food Snack Test (FST), but with differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups. Furthermore, we found that increased food craving in these contexts was highly associated with subsequent amounts of HP food snack intake. Finally, both ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. Together, these results support the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.\\nExposure to food cue imagery led to significant increases in HP food craving prior to the presentation of the FST at the pre-snack timepoint in both lean and OW individuals. Moreover, food cue-related increases in food craving predicted significant increases in HP snack intake across both lean and OW individuals. These data are consistent with a significant literature indicating that rewarding stimuli and their related contexts increase motivation and wanting of rewarding stimuli via conditioning and/or incentive salience mechanisms [4, 20, 42]. Also, a number of basic science and human neuroimaging studies have shown that food cue stimulus exposure increases food craving and activate brain reward and motivation regions [4, 7-11, 18, 43, 44]. Current findings further indicate that such food cue-related increases in HP food craving promote HP snack intake with greater intake of HP foods in the food cue context relative to the neutral relaxing contexts across individuals. These data validate the real-world contexts of advertising of HP foods to promote greater sales and intake of HP foods.\\nIn contrast, we found a differential impact of stress on HP food craving and intake by BMI group where stress significantly increased food craving relative to the neutral condition, but only in the overweight and not the lean group. Furthermore, stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group, suggesting that food motivational processes may be relevant in identifying those who are vulnerable to stress-induced eating. Previous laboratory studies have shown mixed results with some showing stress increasing food intake [17, 24], but others reporting no consistent increases in intake [23, 45]. While the methodology has varied across these studies, current findings suggest the need for direct comparison of BMI groups and consideration of weight-related adaptations in assessing stress effects on HP food motivation and intake. Current findings are also supported by a growing literature suggesting that BMI-related alterations impact not only metabolic hormones but also stress and reward processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake [18, 20, 44]. Together our findings on food cue- and stress- related effects on HP food motivation and intake suggests differential effects by BMI, that may in turn, point to different mechanisms that may drive weight gain and obesity risk in individuals who are lean versus those who are overweight.\\nOur findings also show differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin responses and their contribution to HP food motivation and intake. Stress and food cue exposure increased ghrelin responses, but significantly for the OW and not the LN group. Furthermore, only in the OW group was stress-induced ghrelin increases significantly associated with both HP food craving and subsequent HP food intake. While ghrelin has well known homeostatic effects on feeding function [46, 47], recent focus has been on its role in both stress and mood regulation as well as in hedonically motivated feeding behavior, partially via its effects on mesolimbic reward circuits [37, 48]. Findings indicate that ghrelin can shift preferences to high palatable foods and increase the motivational aspects of food reward [48]. Ghrelin is also known to increase with stress and is involved in regulating anxiety and mood (36, 49-51). Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that ghrelin administration increases the neural response to food pictures in areas associated with hedonic eating (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and ventral tegmental area) [52]. Additionally, there is growing evidence that feed-forward circuitry between stress and food reward maybe partly mediated by ghrelin [52, 53]. In the current study, as the effects were specific to the OW group, they suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions.\\nFinally, our findings also showed differential effects of cortisol responses to stress and food cue exposure. Notably, there was a significant increase in cortisol in the food cue relative to the neutral condition that was due to significant increases in cortisol in the lean group and not so in the OW group. Furthermore, food cue-related increases in cortisol was associated with greater food cue-related HP craving, suggesting a role for cortisol in food motivation. While glucocorticoids are often associated with the stress response, they are also known to play an important role in energy intake and regulation. Cortisol increases have been noted with intake of specific macronutrients, including carbohydrates, fats and proteins in animals and humans [6, 54], with the source of cortisol increases to be via both adrenal and extra-adrenal production [54]. Furthermore, in our previous neuroimaging study, increases in cortisol during a mild hypoglycemic state was associated with greater activation of brain reward regions that promoted greater food craving [44]. Together, this previous research supports current findings of the association between greater cortisol responses to food cue exposure with food cue-induced HP food craving.\\nWe did not see an overall significant increase in cortisol during stress exposure, but this was largely due to a lack of response in the OW group. Remarkably, the OW group showed blunted cortisol responses during stress and food cue relative to neutral conditions. This finding is consistent with growing evidence of blunted cortisol and autonomic responses to stress challenge in people who are OW or obese, along with altered autonomic and peripheral catecholamine responses to stress challenge in those weight groups [18, 21-25, 55]. HPA axis adaptations with low cortisol awakening responses have been reported in higher BMI groups, along with blunted responses to stress and reduced dopamine activity [20, 56]. Thus, the current findings of lack of cortisol increases in the OW group leads one to speculate that such HPA axis adaptations may contribute to higher HP food craving and intake in food cue and in stress contexts. However, this is speculation and would need further testing in future studies.\\nSeveral limitations of the current study need to be considered. First, the sample size was small and thus the findings are preliminary and need further validation. Also, due to the small sample size, sex differences and differential responses within the overweight groups were not assessed. It is possible that men and women differ in their food motivation and intake responses in food cue and stress contexts as shown in previous work [26,27]. Also, continuous assessment of BMI rather than arbitrary cutoffs for individuals in the lean, overweight and obese BMI range may provide greater sensitivity in assessing weight related adaptations. Thus, research with larger samples is required to replicate current findings and address these issues. Finally, as this study was conducted while participants were in a hospital, it is not clear whether the findings are generalizable to an outpatient experimental context or to real world food motivation and intake settings. On the other hand, as food cues and stress are among the most common contexts in which overeating of HP foods occur in the real world, the current study presents a well-controlled experimental model to study the biobehavioral processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake of highly palatable foods. Evidence of HP food motivation and increased snacking in these contexts is consistent with reports of obesogenic environments promoting increased HP food intake and weight gain in the real world. Furthermore, positive associations of HP food craving and intake by total ghrelin and cortisol responses suggests a role for metabolic and neuroendocrine adaptations in increased HP food motivation and intake.\\n</td>\n",

Together our findings on food cue- and stress- related effects on HP food motivation and intake suggests differential effects by BMI, that may in turn, point to different mechanisms that may drive weight gain and obesity risk in individuals who are lean versus those who are overweight.\\nOur findings also show differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin responses and their contribution to HP food motivation and intake. Stress and food cue exposure increased ghrelin responses, but significantly for the OW and not the LN group. Furthermore, only in the OW group was stress-induced ghrelin increases significantly associated with both HP food craving and subsequent HP food intake. While ghrelin has well known homeostatic effects on feeding function [46, 47], recent focus has been on its role in both stress and mood regulation as well as in hedonically motivated feeding behavior, partially via its effects on mesolimbic reward circuits [37, 48]. Findings indicate that ghrelin can shift preferences to high palatable foods and increase the motivational aspects of food reward [48]. Ghrelin is also known to increase with stress and is involved in regulating anxiety and mood (36, 49-51). Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that ghrelin administration increases the neural response to food pictures in areas associated with hedonic eating (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and ventral tegmental area) [52]. Additionally, there is growing evidence that feed-forward circuitry between stress and food reward maybe partly mediated by ghrelin [52, 53]. In the current study, as the effects were specific to the OW group, they suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions.\\nFinally, our findings also showed differential effects of cortisol responses to stress and food cue exposure. Notably, there was a significant increase in cortisol in the food cue relative to the neutral condition that was due to significant increases in cortisol in the lean group and not so in the OW group. Furthermore, food cue-related increases in cortisol was associated with greater food cue-related HP craving, suggesting a role for cortisol in food motivation. While glucocorticoids are often associated with the stress response, they are also known to play an important role in energy intake and regulation. Cortisol increases have been noted with intake of specific macronutrients, including carbohydrates, fats and proteins in animals and humans [6, 54], with the source of cortisol increases to be via both adrenal and extra-adrenal production [54]. Furthermore, in our previous neuroimaging study, increases in cortisol during a mild hypoglycemic state was associated with greater activation of brain reward regions that promoted greater food craving [44]. Together, this previous research supports current findings of the association between greater cortisol responses to food cue exposure with food cue-induced HP food craving.\\nWe did not see an overall significant increase in cortisol during stress exposure, but this was largely due to a lack of response in the OW group. Remarkably, the OW group showed blunted cortisol responses during stress and food cue relative to neutral conditions. This finding is consistent with growing evidence of blunted cortisol and autonomic responses to stress challenge in people who are OW or obese, along with altered autonomic and peripheral catecholamine responses to stress challenge in those weight groups [18, 21-25, 55]. HPA axis adaptations with low cortisol awakening responses have been reported in higher BMI groups, along with blunted responses to stress and reduced dopamine activity [20, 56]. Thus, the current findings of lack of cortisol increases in the OW group leads one to speculate that such HPA axis adaptations may contribute to higher HP food craving and intake in food cue and in stress contexts. However, this is speculation and would need further testing in future studies.\\nSeveral limitations of the current study need to be considered. First, the sample size was small and thus the findings are preliminary and need further validation. Also, due to the small sample size, sex differences and differential responses within the overweight groups were not assessed. It is possible that men and women differ in their food motivation and intake responses in food cue and stress contexts as shown in previous work [26,27]. Also, continuous assessment of BMI rather than arbitrary cutoffs for individuals in the lean, overweight and obese BMI range may provide greater sensitivity in assessing weight related adaptations. Thus, research with larger samples is required to replicate current findings and address these issues. Finally, as this study was conducted while participants were in a hospital, it is not clear whether the findings are generalizable to an outpatient experimental context or to real world food motivation and intake settings. On the other hand, as food cues and stress are among the most common contexts in which overeating of HP foods occur in the real world, the current study presents a well-controlled experimental model to study the biobehavioral processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake of highly palatable foods. Evidence of HP food motivation and increased snacking in these contexts is consistent with reports of obesogenic environments promoting increased HP food intake and weight gain in the real world. Furthermore, positive associations of HP food craving and intake by total ghrelin and cortisol responses suggests a role for metabolic and neuroendocrine adaptations in increased HP food motivation and intake.\\n</td>\n",

positive effect on athletic performance, with no negative associations found. Aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity. Most studies measuring outcomes requiring tactical and/or technical skills found benefits of sleep on performance. Longer-term sleep extension interventions were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension on a short timescale, while sleep extension may contribute to improved performance in the longer term. The review highlights opportunities for innovative research on how generalizable these findings are to other sports and the mechanisms by which sleep affects different aspects of athletic performance.   \n",

positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration than anaerobic activity. Studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Sleep extension may contribute to improved performance in the longer term. Strategies to improve sleep not only the night before an important sports event but also in the weeks leading up to this event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance. Overall, the importance of sleep for professional athletes to achieve high performance varies by the cognitive and physical demands of the sport, but most athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration.   \n",

found that increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or has neutral effects. Aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity. Studies measuring outcomes requiring tactical and technical skills found benefits of sleep on performance. Longer-term sleep intervention studies involving sleep extension showed positive results. Short term sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance. Strategies to improve sleep not only the night before but also in the weeks leading up to an important sports event are likely to be fruitful for athletes. Future research should aim to standardize tests of athletic performance and sleep metrics to identify optimal sleep standards.   \n",

neutral impact on athletic performance. Aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration than anaerobic activity, and sleep extension interventions have improved technical and tactical skills in athletes. Chronic sleep extension has demonstrated significant benefits to athletes, and strategies to improve sleep in the weeks leading up to an important sports event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance. Future research should seek to standardize tests of athletic performance and sleep metrics, investigate the mechanisms by which performance attributes may be sensitive to changes in sleep patterns, and develop feasible interventions to improve the sleep health and performance of athletes. #sciencecommunication #sportsperformance #sleepscience   \n",

       "text           The Impact of Sleep Duration on Performance Among Competitive Athletes: A Systematic Literature Review\\n\\nDISCUSSION \\nThis literature review, although diverse in the range of sports, methods, and outcomes studied, provides several stylized facts that can inform sleep research and competitive athletes. First, out of all the published studies we reviewed, none found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome. All of the results reviewed showed that either the increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Note that among studies reporting significant positive results, effect sizes varied considerably (Tables 2-4), likely due to differences in the duration of sleep deprivation/extension experienced as well as differences in outcome measures. Second, when considering the aerobic and anaerobic characteristics of sports, it seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. For instance, Mejri et al40 found that depriving competitive taekwondo boxers of a mere 3 to 4 hours of sleep significantly impaired performance on the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test. By contrast, Blumert et al33 employed a relatively severe sleep deprivation protocol by depriving 9 national-caliber collegiate weightlifters of 24 hours of sleep and yet failed to identify adverse effects on any of the various weightlifting exercises examined. Relatedly, for both endurance and explosive, power-based exercises, it has been well documented that sleep deprivation is associated with increased perceived effort.56–58 Still, the relationship between perceived effort and objective performance has not been widely validated and is a topic for future investigation. Third, of the studies that measured outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills, most find benefits of sleep on performance. Tennis serving accuracy and basketball shooting were both improved by long-term sleep extension interventions,35,39 and tennis serving accuracy suffered when players were deprived of 2 to 2.5 hours of sleep at the beginning of the preceding night.37 Regarding studies conducted in players of team sports that incorporated tactics and decision-based outcomes to a broader extent, soccer as well as rugby players exhibited performance deficits after nights of decreased sleep duration.34 These results are in line with other literature demonstrating clear neurocognitive deficits in the setting of inadequate sleep in the general population, reviewed thoroughly elsewhere.59,60 Finally, when looking at the methodologies of the experimental studies, we found that the studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Interestingly although most acute sleep interventions involved sleep deprivation and yielded positive results, there were inconsistent results among the 2 acute sleep extension studies.15,38 Conversely, the majority of longer-term sleep intervention studies involved sleep extension and showed positive results.35,39,49 Taken together, these findings suggest that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. On the other hand, more research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. The reliability and precision of the various measurements may present challenges in interpretation of these studies. For example, “maximal” voluntary muscle contraction and voluntarily chosen training load are variable across subjects.61,62 On the other hand, “running economy,” the oxygen cost associated with a given running velocity, has low variability among highly trained runners and is significantly correlated with cardiorespiratory parameters used to assess aerobic capacity.63 A meta-analysis of the reliability of various measures of muscle power previously identified that field running tests tended to be more reliable than treadmill running tests, tests lasting up to 1 minute tended to be more reliable than those lasting greater than 1 minute (likely due to increased variability in muscle movement and limb positioning), and isokinetic tests tended to be more reliable when measuring muscle extension versus flexion.62 Somewhat reassuringly in the context of the present review, this metaanalysis also found that measurements taken from athletes were more reliable than those taken from non-athlete subjects. With respect to the validity of outcome measures reported as performance indicators, the nature of the sport (eg, team vs individual) may be an important determinant of whether what is measured in the laboratory translates to the actual game. For instance, for team-based sports requiring complex game structure such as soccer, measures of muscle force production or running speed are likely insufficient to provide an accurate assessment of in-game performance, although they may be helpful in making gross approximations and predictions.64 Of course, actual performance metrics from real or simulated games would be the ideal outcomes to quantify for such sports in future investigations. More specifically, for performance outcomes included in the current review, the following have been independently validated and shown to be reliable measures of athletic performance: Yo-Yo intermittent recovery (YYIR) test, isometric muscle contraction, squat, countermovement jump, free sthrow basketball shooting, tennis serving, shuttle-running tests, and Wingate test.42–48 In Table 1, we have indicated studies employing previously validated and reliable metrics of objective performance with asterisks (as per the criteria discussed above). Still, more work will be required to further validate the various performance outcomes measured in the studies reviewed in the present work, especially those involving complex, team-based measures such as composite game performance scores and passing accuracy. Likewise, given the high inter-individual variability of sleep variables used across the included studies, these metrics will also require further investigation to determine their precision and reliability as predictors of athletic performance. Importantly, we chose to require at least one objective performance measure among our inclusion criteria. The previous work relying on self-perceived performance, although informative in understanding the potential effect of sleep loss or gain on sports psychology,15 may not accurately reflect actual performance, as was the goal of the present work. However, under certain circumstances, self-perceived pre-game wellness (including self-reported sleep quality) may be predictive of objective in-game performance.65 More research will be needed to assess the validity of playerreported performance and objective performance, especially when athletes exhibit compromised sleep. Several experimental studies are particularly illustrative of the various trends in the results we have just outlined. To address the question of whether one night of sleep extension would be sufficient to improve various fitness indices among semi-professional soccer players, Fullagar et al15 tested a sleep hygiene intervention. The investigators implemented a sleep hygiene strategy (SHS) designed to maximize sleep duration and limit stimulation before bedtime to test whether this would be sufficient to improve either anaerobic (jumping height and force production) or aerobic endurance (Yo–Yo intermittent recovery level 2, YYIR2) performance after latenight soccer matches. Implementing a randomized design, they assigned 20 participants to follow either their normal post-match sleep routine [non-SHS (NSHS)] or a SHS involving early dimming of lights and lights out by midnight, cool room temperature, and no technology or light stimulation for 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. Actigraphy was used to measure sleep patterns, and sleep diary was used for subjective recall of sleep quality. Despite finding that those assigned to the SHS indeed exhibited increased sleep duration after the night match relative to those in the NSHS group, the investigators failed to identify any improvements in countermovement jump height, countermovement jump force production, or YYIR2 performance, tested over the following 2 days. On the other hand, as we have discussed, studies of acute sleep deprivation, especially those measuring technical performance outcomes, tended to yield positive results. Given that sleep is often disrupted the night before athletic competition,66 athletes involved in sports requiring these types of skills are likely to be particularly sensitive to sleep manipulations and thus should be counseled regarding the importance of sleep for game performance. Relatedly, chronic sleep extension studies have demonstrated significant benefits to athletes.35,49 Thus, strategies to improve sleep not only the night before an important sports event but also in the weeks leading up to this event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance. In this review, we have summarized and synthesized recent findings in the realm of sports and sleep science. One of the challenges of conducting such a literature review is that the study methodologies vary a great deal, as do the individual sports, making comparisons of effects and magnitudes of effect sizes across studies difficult. Additionally, unlike many studies of athletic performance and sleep conducted in nonathletes and recreational sports players, studies incorporating high-level competitors are limited, especially those implementing experimental approaches. Even among the best-controlled studies, sample sizes are small and sleep measurements vary considerably, with some studies measuring sleep duration objectively through polysomnography or actigraphy and others relying on self-report. All of these factors limit the scope of the conclusions that can be drawn. Nevertheless, they do provide valuable information about when sleep does or particularly when sleep does not seem to play a key role in influencing performance. Future research may seek to use larger sample sizes and standardize tests of athletic performance in order to identify optimal sleep standards, in addition to standardizing sleep metrics and incorporating more objective sleep data. In particular, here we focused on studies investigating sleep duration, although sleep timing is likely to be a relevant factor as well. As sleep onset and wake time have previously been shown to influence performance and recovery,5 future studies should aim to incorporate this information. Given these suggestions for improving future research, there are many opportunities for innovative research on this topic. One area in particular may be about how generalizable these findings are to other sports. Given the wide range of methodologies and used in these studies, another research goal would be to harmonize measures across studies and conduct a meta-analysis. Another area to investigate is trade-offs between wake time activities (eg, athletic practice) and sleep. For example, is it beneficial for swimmers to practice early in the morning even at the expense of their sleep? Research also should seek to investigate the mechanisms by which aerobic, tactical, and technical performance attributes may be preferentially sensitive to changes in sleep patterns. One limitation of the present work is that although the number of hours and/or nights of sleep interventions across studies varied, sleep duration was only measured the night before performance assessment. Thus, in order to obtain a more complete picture of sleep quantity and quality, future research should aim to measure sleep across the entire study period. Another limitation is that few of the studies examined explicitly the relationship between subjective sleep quality and performance, especially using validated sleep quality questionnaires such as the PSQI and ESS. Thus, this remains an open question that will be important to be investigated in the future. Once all these data are gathered, feasible and effective interventions should be developed, implemented, and evaluated to improve the sleep health and optimal performance of athletes. In conclusion, the importance of sleep for professional athletes to achieve high performance varies by the cognitive and physical demands of the sport. However, because most sports require integration of aerobic fitness, tactical skills, and technical skills, competitive athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration.  \\n   \n",

a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity. Studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Chronic sleep extension studies have demonstrated significant benefits to athletes. Sleep timing is likely to be a relevant factor as well. Competitive athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration. #sports #sleep #athleticperformance #research   \n",

increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance, with no negative associations found. Aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity. Studies measuring outcomes requiring tactical and/or technical skills found benefits of sleep on performance. Longer-term sleep extension interventions showed positive results while acute sleep interventions involving sleep deprivation yielded positive results inconsistently. More research is needed to determine the precision and reliability of sleep variables used across studies as predictors of athletic performance. Competitive athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration. #sleep #athleticperformance #systematicliteraturereview #sciencecommunication   \n",

has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. For outcomes requiring tactical and/or technical skills, most find benefits of sleep on performance. Longer-term sleep extension studies involved sleep extension and showed positive results. Sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance on a short timescale. Future research should aim to measure sleep across the entire study period and investigate the mechanisms by which performance attributes may be preferentially sensitive to changes in sleep patterns. Competitive athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration.   \n",

                                     \"Systematic literature review finds no negative impact of sleep duration on athletic performance. Aerobic activity more sensitive to sleep duration than anaerobic activity. Studies show benefits of sleep on technical and tactical skills in sports. Short-term sleep deprivation harmful, while long-term sleep extension contributes to improved performance. Further research needed to validate performance metrics and investigate trade-offs between wake time activities and sleep. #SportsScience #SleepHealth #AthleticPerformance\"   \n",

       "text           The Impact of Sleep Duration on Performance Among Competitive Athletes: A Systematic Literature Review\\n\\nDISCUSSION \\nThis literature review, although diverse in the range of sports, methods, and outcomes studied, provides several stylized facts that can inform sleep research and competitive athletes. First, out of all the published studies we reviewed, none found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome. All of the results reviewed showed that either the increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Note that among studies reporting significant positive results, effect sizes varied considerably (Tables 2-4), likely due to differences in the duration of sleep deprivation/extension experienced as well as differences in outcome measures. Second, when considering the aerobic and anaerobic characteristics of sports, it seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. For instance, Mejri et al40 found that depriving competitive taekwondo boxers of a mere 3 to 4 hours of sleep significantly impaired performance on the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test. By contrast, Blumert et al33 employed a relatively severe sleep deprivation protocol by depriving 9 national-caliber collegiate weightlifters of 24 hours of sleep and yet failed to identify adverse effects on any of the various weightlifting exercises examined. Relatedly, for both endurance and explosive, power-based exercises, it has been well documented that sleep deprivation is associated with increased perceived effort.56–58 Still, the relationship between perceived effort and objective performance has not been widely validated and is a topic for future investigation. Third, of the studies that measured outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills, most find benefits of sleep on performance. Tennis serving accuracy and basketball shooting were both improved by long-term sleep extension interventions,35,39 and tennis serving accuracy suffered when players were deprived of 2 to 2.5 hours of sleep at the beginning of the preceding night.37 Regarding studies conducted in players of team sports that incorporated tactics and decision-based outcomes to a broader extent, soccer as well as rugby players exhibited performance deficits after nights of decreased sleep duration.34 These results are in line with other literature demonstrating clear neurocognitive deficits in the setting of inadequate sleep in the general population, reviewed thoroughly elsewhere.59,60 Finally, when looking at the methodologies of the experimental studies, we found that the studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Interestingly although most acute sleep interventions involved sleep deprivation and yielded positive results, there were inconsistent results among the 2 acute sleep extension studies.15,38 Conversely, the majority of longer-term sleep intervention studies involved sleep extension and showed positive results.35,39,49 Taken together, these findings suggest that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. On the other hand, more research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. The reliability and precision of the various measurements may present challenges in interpretation of these studies. For example, “maximal” voluntary muscle contraction and voluntarily chosen training load are variable across subjects.61,62 On the other hand, “running economy,” the oxygen cost associated with a given running velocity, has low variability among highly trained runners and is significantly correlated with cardiorespiratory parameters used to assess aerobic capacity.63 A meta-analysis of the reliability of various measures of muscle power previously identified that field running tests tended to be more reliable than treadmill running tests, tests lasting up to 1 minute tended to be more reliable than those lasting greater than 1 minute (likely due to increased variability in muscle movement and limb positioning), and isokinetic tests tended to be more reliable when measuring muscle extension versus flexion.62 Somewhat reassuringly in the context of the present review, this metaanalysis also found that measurements taken from athletes were more reliable than those taken from non-athlete subjects. With respect to the validity of outcome measures reported as performance indicators, the nature of the sport (eg, team vs individual) may be an important determinant of whether what is measured in the laboratory translates to the actual game. For instance, for team-based sports requiring complex game structure such as soccer, measures of muscle force production or running speed are likely insufficient to provide an accurate assessment of in-game performance, although they may be helpful in making gross approximations and predictions.64 Of course, actual performance metrics from real or simulated games would be the ideal outcomes to quantify for such sports in future investigations. More specifically, for performance outcomes included in the current review, the following have been independently validated and shown to be reliable measures of athletic performance: Yo-Yo intermittent recovery (YYIR) test, isometric muscle contraction, squat, countermovement jump, free sthrow basketball shooting, tennis serving, shuttle-running tests, and Wingate test.42–48 In Table 1, we have indicated studies employing previously validated and reliable metrics of objective performance with asterisks (as per the criteria discussed above). Still, more work will be required to further validate the various performance outcomes measured in the studies reviewed in the present work, especially those involving complex, team-based measures such as composite game performance scores and passing accuracy. Likewise, given the high inter-individual variability of sleep variables used across the included studies, these metrics will also require further investigation to determine their precision and reliability as predictors of athletic performance. Importantly, we chose to require at least one objective performance measure among our inclusion criteria. The previous work relying on self-perceived performance, although informative in understanding the potential effect of sleep loss or gain on sports psychology,15 may not accurately reflect actual performance, as was the goal of the present work. However, under certain circumstances, self-perceived pre-game wellness (including self-reported sleep quality) may be predictive of objective in-game performance.65 More research will be needed to assess the validity of playerreported performance and objective performance, especially when athletes exhibit compromised sleep. Several experimental studies are particularly illustrative of the various trends in the results we have just outlined. To address the question of whether one night of sleep extension would be sufficient to improve various fitness indices among semi-professional soccer players, Fullagar et al15 tested a sleep hygiene intervention. The investigators implemented a sleep hygiene strategy (SHS) designed to maximize sleep duration and limit stimulation before bedtime to test whether this would be sufficient to improve either anaerobic (jumping height and force production) or aerobic endurance (Yo–Yo intermittent recovery level 2, YYIR2) performance after latenight soccer matches. Implementing a randomized design, they assigned 20 participants to follow either their normal post-match sleep routine [non-SHS (NSHS)] or a SHS involving early dimming of lights and lights out by midnight, cool room temperature, and no technology or light stimulation for 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. Actigraphy was used to measure sleep patterns, and sleep diary was used for subjective recall of sleep quality. Despite finding that those assigned to the SHS indeed exhibited increased sleep duration after the night match relative to those in the NSHS group, the investigators failed to identify any improvements in countermovement jump height, countermovement jump force production, or YYIR2 performance, tested over the following 2 days. On the other hand, as we have discussed, studies of acute sleep deprivation, especially those measuring technical performance outcomes, tended to yield positive results. Given that sleep is often disrupted the night before athletic competition,66 athletes involved in sports requiring these types of skills are likely to be particularly sensitive to sleep manipulations and thus should be counseled regarding the importance of sleep for game performance. Relatedly, chronic sleep extension studies have demonstrated significant benefits to athletes.35,49 Thus, strategies to improve sleep not only the night before an important sports event but also in the weeks leading up to this event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance. In this review, we have summarized and synthesized recent findings in the realm of sports and sleep science. One of the challenges of conducting such a literature review is that the study methodologies vary a great deal, as do the individual sports, making comparisons of effects and magnitudes of effect sizes across studies difficult. Additionally, unlike many studies of athletic performance and sleep conducted in nonathletes and recreational sports players, studies incorporating high-level competitors are limited, especially those implementing experimental approaches. Even among the best-controlled studies, sample sizes are small and sleep measurements vary considerably, with some studies measuring sleep duration objectively through polysomnography or actigraphy and others relying on self-report. All of these factors limit the scope of the conclusions that can be drawn. Nevertheless, they do provide valuable information about when sleep does or particularly when sleep does not seem to play a key role in influencing performance. Future research may seek to use larger sample sizes and standardize tests of athletic performance in order to identify optimal sleep standards, in addition to standardizing sleep metrics and incorporating more objective sleep data. In particular, here we focused on studies investigating sleep duration, although sleep timing is likely to be a relevant factor as well. As sleep onset and wake time have previously been shown to influence performance and recovery,5 future studies should aim to incorporate this information. Given these suggestions for improving future research, there are many opportunities for innovative research on this topic. One area in particular may be about how generalizable these findings are to other sports. Given the wide range of methodologies and used in these studies, another research goal would be to harmonize measures across studies and conduct a meta-analysis. Another area to investigate is trade-offs between wake time activities (eg, athletic practice) and sleep. For example, is it beneficial for swimmers to practice early in the morning even at the expense of their sleep? Research also should seek to investigate the mechanisms by which aerobic, tactical, and technical performance attributes may be preferentially sensitive to changes in sleep patterns. One limitation of the present work is that although the number of hours and/or nights of sleep interventions across studies varied, sleep duration was only measured the night before performance assessment. Thus, in order to obtain a more complete picture of sleep quantity and quality, future research should aim to measure sleep across the entire study period. Another limitation is that few of the studies examined explicitly the relationship between subjective sleep quality and performance, especially using validated sleep quality questionnaires such as the PSQI and ESS. Thus, this remains an open question that will be important to be investigated in the future. Once all these data are gathered, feasible and effective interventions should be developed, implemented, and evaluated to improve the sleep health and optimal performance of athletes. In conclusion, the importance of sleep for professional athletes to achieve high performance varies by the cognitive and physical demands of the sport. However, because most sports require integration of aerobic fitness, tactical skills, and technical skills, competitive athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration.  \\n   \n",

I just read a systematic literature review that explored the impact of sleep duration on performance among competitive athletes. The review found that none of the published studies showed a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome. In fact, increased sleep duration had a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Interestingly, aerobic activity was found to be more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity. When considering the methodologies of the experimental studies, longer-term sleep interventions were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Additionally, most studies that measured outcomes requiring tactical and/or technical skills found benefits of sleep on performance. However, more research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. Overall, the review suggests that athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration.   \n",

                                         Hey, did you know that a systematic review of studies on the impact of sleep duration on athletic performance found that none of the studies showed a negative association between sleep duration and performance outcomes? In fact, most studies found that increased sleep duration had a positive effect on athletic performance or had no effect at all. Interestingly, aerobic activity was found to be more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. Studies also found that sleep extension interventions improved tennis serving accuracy and basketball shooting, while sleep deprivation impaired performance in soccer and rugby players. The review also suggests that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. However, more research is needed to determine the potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. Overall, the review highlights the importance of sleep for athletes in achieving optimal performance.   \n",

know that a systematic literature review found that none of the published studies reviewed showed a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome among competitive athletes? In fact, increased sleep duration either had a positive effect or no effect on athletic performance. This was especially true for sports requiring tactical and technical skills. Additionally, studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. It seems that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. Interesting, right?   \n",

association between sleep duration and athletic performance? In fact, increased sleep duration either had a positive effect or was neutral. And, interestingly, it seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity. Also, most studies that measured outcomes requiring tactical and/or technical skills found benefits of sleep on performance. Additionally, the studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. These findings suggest that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance.   \n",

        Hey! I just read a literature review on the impact of sleep duration on performance among competitive athletes. The review found that none of the studies reviewed showed a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome, which is pretty interesting. They also found that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity. The studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show a positive effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Finally, the review suggests that athletes involved in sports requiring technical skills are likely to be particularly sensitive to sleep manipulations and thus should be counseled regarding the importance of sleep for game performance. Overall, the review provides valuable information on when sleep does or particularly when sleep does not seem to play a key role in influencing performance among competitive athletes.   \n",
       "text           The Impact of Sleep Duration on Performance Among Competitive Athletes: A Systematic Literature Review\\n\\nDISCUSSION \\nThis literature review, although diverse in the range of sports, methods, and outcomes studied, provides several stylized facts that can inform sleep research and competitive athletes. First, out of all the published studies we reviewed, none found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome. All of the results reviewed showed that either the increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Note that among studies reporting significant positive results, effect sizes varied considerably (Tables 2-4), likely due to differences in the duration of sleep deprivation/extension experienced as well as differences in outcome measures. Second, when considering the aerobic and anaerobic characteristics of sports, it seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. For instance, Mejri et al40 found that depriving competitive taekwondo boxers of a mere 3 to 4 hours of sleep significantly impaired performance on the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test. By contrast, Blumert et al33 employed a relatively severe sleep deprivation protocol by depriving 9 national-caliber collegiate weightlifters of 24 hours of sleep and yet failed to identify adverse effects on any of the various weightlifting exercises examined. Relatedly, for both endurance and explosive, power-based exercises, it has been well documented that sleep deprivation is associated with increased perceived effort.56–58 Still, the relationship between perceived effort and objective performance has not been widely validated and is a topic for future investigation. Third, of the studies that measured outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills, most find benefits of sleep on performance. Tennis serving accuracy and basketball shooting were both improved by long-term sleep extension interventions,35,39 and tennis serving accuracy suffered when players were deprived of 2 to 2.5 hours of sleep at the beginning of the preceding night.37 Regarding studies conducted in players of team sports that incorporated tactics and decision-based outcomes to a broader extent, soccer as well as rugby players exhibited performance deficits after nights of decreased sleep duration.34 These results are in line with other literature demonstrating clear neurocognitive deficits in the setting of inadequate sleep in the general population, reviewed thoroughly elsewhere.59,60 Finally, when looking at the methodologies of the experimental studies, we found that the studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Interestingly although most acute sleep interventions involved sleep deprivation and yielded positive results, there were inconsistent results among the 2 acute sleep extension studies.15,38 Conversely, the majority of longer-term sleep intervention studies involved sleep extension and showed positive results.35,39,49 Taken together, these findings suggest that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. On the other hand, more research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. The reliability and precision of the various measurements may present challenges in interpretation of these studies. For example, “maximal” voluntary muscle contraction and voluntarily chosen training load are variable across subjects.61,62 On the other hand, “running economy,” the oxygen cost associated with a given running velocity, has low variability among highly trained runners and is significantly correlated with cardiorespiratory parameters used to assess aerobic capacity.63 A meta-analysis of the reliability of various measures of muscle power previously identified that field running tests tended to be more reliable than treadmill running tests, tests lasting up to 1 minute tended to be more reliable than those lasting greater than 1 minute (likely due to increased variability in muscle movement and limb positioning), and isokinetic tests tended to be more reliable when measuring muscle extension versus flexion.62 Somewhat reassuringly in the context of the present review, this metaanalysis also found that measurements taken from athletes were more reliable than those taken from non-athlete subjects. With respect to the validity of outcome measures reported as performance indicators, the nature of the sport (eg, team vs individual) may be an important determinant of whether what is measured in the laboratory translates to the actual game. For instance, for team-based sports requiring complex game structure such as soccer, measures of muscle force production or running speed are likely insufficient to provide an accurate assessment of in-game performance, although they may be helpful in making gross approximations and predictions.64 Of course, actual performance metrics from real or simulated games would be the ideal outcomes to quantify for such sports in future investigations. More specifically, for performance outcomes included in the current review, the following have been independently validated and shown to be reliable measures of athletic performance: Yo-Yo intermittent recovery (YYIR) test, isometric muscle contraction, squat, countermovement jump, free sthrow basketball shooting, tennis serving, shuttle-running tests, and Wingate test.42–48 In Table 1, we have indicated studies employing previously validated and reliable metrics of objective performance with asterisks (as per the criteria discussed above). Still, more work will be required to further validate the various performance outcomes measured in the studies reviewed in the present work, especially those involving complex, team-based measures such as composite game performance scores and passing accuracy. Likewise, given the high inter-individual variability of sleep variables used across the included studies, these metrics will also require further investigation to determine their precision and reliability as predictors of athletic performance. Importantly, we chose to require at least one objective performance measure among our inclusion criteria. The previous work relying on self-perceived performance, although informative in understanding the potential effect of sleep loss or gain on sports psychology,15 may not accurately reflect actual performance, as was the goal of the present work. However, under certain circumstances, self-perceived pre-game wellness (including self-reported sleep quality) may be predictive of objective in-game performance.65 More research will be needed to assess the validity of playerreported performance and objective performance, especially when athletes exhibit compromised sleep. Several experimental studies are particularly illustrative of the various trends in the results we have just outlined. To address the question of whether one night of sleep extension would be sufficient to improve various fitness indices among semi-professional soccer players, Fullagar et al15 tested a sleep hygiene intervention. The investigators implemented a sleep hygiene strategy (SHS) designed to maximize sleep duration and limit stimulation before bedtime to test whether this would be sufficient to improve either anaerobic (jumping height and force production) or aerobic endurance (Yo–Yo intermittent recovery level 2, YYIR2) performance after latenight soccer matches. Implementing a randomized design, they assigned 20 participants to follow either their normal post-match sleep routine [non-SHS (NSHS)] or a SHS involving early dimming of lights and lights out by midnight, cool room temperature, and no technology or light stimulation for 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. Actigraphy was used to measure sleep patterns, and sleep diary was used for subjective recall of sleep quality. Despite finding that those assigned to the SHS indeed exhibited increased sleep duration after the night match relative to those in the NSHS group, the investigators failed to identify any improvements in countermovement jump height, countermovement jump force production, or YYIR2 performance, tested over the following 2 days. On the other hand, as we have discussed, studies of acute sleep deprivation, especially those measuring technical performance outcomes, tended to yield positive results. Given that sleep is often disrupted the night before athletic competition,66 athletes involved in sports requiring these types of skills are likely to be particularly sensitive to sleep manipulations and thus should be counseled regarding the importance of sleep for game performance. Relatedly, chronic sleep extension studies have demonstrated significant benefits to athletes.35,49 Thus, strategies to improve sleep not only the night before an important sports event but also in the weeks leading up to this event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance. In this review, we have summarized and synthesized recent findings in the realm of sports and sleep science. One of the challenges of conducting such a literature review is that the study methodologies vary a great deal, as do the individual sports, making comparisons of effects and magnitudes of effect sizes across studies difficult. Additionally, unlike many studies of athletic performance and sleep conducted in nonathletes and recreational sports players, studies incorporating high-level competitors are limited, especially those implementing experimental approaches. Even among the best-controlled studies, sample sizes are small and sleep measurements vary considerably, with some studies measuring sleep duration objectively through polysomnography or actigraphy and others relying on self-report. All of these factors limit the scope of the conclusions that can be drawn. Nevertheless, they do provide valuable information about when sleep does or particularly when sleep does not seem to play a key role in influencing performance. Future research may seek to use larger sample sizes and standardize tests of athletic performance in order to identify optimal sleep standards, in addition to standardizing sleep metrics and incorporating more objective sleep data. In particular, here we focused on studies investigating sleep duration, although sleep timing is likely to be a relevant factor as well. As sleep onset and wake time have previously been shown to influence performance and recovery,5 future studies should aim to incorporate this information. Given these suggestions for improving future research, there are many opportunities for innovative research on this topic. One area in particular may be about how generalizable these findings are to other sports. Given the wide range of methodologies and used in these studies, another research goal would be to harmonize measures across studies and conduct a meta-analysis. Another area to investigate is trade-offs between wake time activities (eg, athletic practice) and sleep. For example, is it beneficial for swimmers to practice early in the morning even at the expense of their sleep? Research also should seek to investigate the mechanisms by which aerobic, tactical, and technical performance attributes may be preferentially sensitive to changes in sleep patterns. One limitation of the present work is that although the number of hours and/or nights of sleep interventions across studies varied, sleep duration was only measured the night before performance assessment. Thus, in order to obtain a more complete picture of sleep quantity and quality, future research should aim to measure sleep across the entire study period. Another limitation is that few of the studies examined explicitly the relationship between subjective sleep quality and performance, especially using validated sleep quality questionnaires such as the PSQI and ESS. Thus, this remains an open question that will be important to be investigated in the future. Once all these data are gathered, feasible and effective interventions should be developed, implemented, and evaluated to improve the sleep health and optimal performance of athletes. In conclusion, the importance of sleep for professional athletes to achieve high performance varies by the cognitive and physical demands of the sport. However, because most sports require integration of aerobic fitness, tactical skills, and technical skills, competitive athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration.  \\n   \n",

effect on athletic performance among competitive athletes? In fact, none of the published studies reviewed found a negative association between sleep duration and performance outcomes. The review also found that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, and that outcomes requiring tactical and/or technical skills benefit from sleep. Additionally, studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. However, more research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. Overall, the review suggests that competitive athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration.   \n",

found that increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance among competitive athletes? They reviewed a range of sports and outcomes and found that none of the published studies showed a negative association between sleep duration and performance. The impact of sleep on performance was more significant for aerobic activity compared to anaerobic activity, and studies measuring outcomes requiring tactical and/or technical skills found benefits of sleep on performance. Interestingly, longer-term sleep extension interventions were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. While there are limitations to the study, it suggests that improving sleep duration could be fruitful in improving athletic performance.   \n",

                                                          Hey, did you know that a systematic literature review on the impact of sleep duration on performance among competitive athletes found that none of the published studies reviewed found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome? In fact, all the results reviewed showed that either increased sleep duration had a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Also, it seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. Lastly, longer-term sleep extension may contribute to improved performance, while sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension on a short timescale.   \n",

did you know that a systematic literature review found that there is no negative association between sleep duration and athletic performance? In fact, increased sleep duration has a positive effect on performance or the results were neutral. However, aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. Studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Also, studies of acute sleep deprivation, especially those measuring technical performance outcomes, tended to yield positive results. On the other hand, chronic sleep extension studies have demonstrated significant benefits to athletes. The review suggests that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance.   \n",

       "text           The Impact of Sleep Duration on Performance Among Competitive Athletes: A Systematic Literature Review\\n\\nDISCUSSION \\nThis literature review, although diverse in the range of sports, methods, and outcomes studied, provides several stylized facts that can inform sleep research and competitive athletes. First, out of all the published studies we reviewed, none found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome. All of the results reviewed showed that either the increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Note that among studies reporting significant positive results, effect sizes varied considerably (Tables 2-4), likely due to differences in the duration of sleep deprivation/extension experienced as well as differences in outcome measures. Second, when considering the aerobic and anaerobic characteristics of sports, it seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. For instance, Mejri et al40 found that depriving competitive taekwondo boxers of a mere 3 to 4 hours of sleep significantly impaired performance on the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test. By contrast, Blumert et al33 employed a relatively severe sleep deprivation protocol by depriving 9 national-caliber collegiate weightlifters of 24 hours of sleep and yet failed to identify adverse effects on any of the various weightlifting exercises examined. Relatedly, for both endurance and explosive, power-based exercises, it has been well documented that sleep deprivation is associated with increased perceived effort.56–58 Still, the relationship between perceived effort and objective performance has not been widely validated and is a topic for future investigation. Third, of the studies that measured outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills, most find benefits of sleep on performance. Tennis serving accuracy and basketball shooting were both improved by long-term sleep extension interventions,35,39 and tennis serving accuracy suffered when players were deprived of 2 to 2.5 hours of sleep at the beginning of the preceding night.37 Regarding studies conducted in players of team sports that incorporated tactics and decision-based outcomes to a broader extent, soccer as well as rugby players exhibited performance deficits after nights of decreased sleep duration.34 These results are in line with other literature demonstrating clear neurocognitive deficits in the setting of inadequate sleep in the general population, reviewed thoroughly elsewhere.59,60 Finally, when looking at the methodologies of the experimental studies, we found that the studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Interestingly although most acute sleep interventions involved sleep deprivation and yielded positive results, there were inconsistent results among the 2 acute sleep extension studies.15,38 Conversely, the majority of longer-term sleep intervention studies involved sleep extension and showed positive results.35,39,49 Taken together, these findings suggest that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. On the other hand, more research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. The reliability and precision of the various measurements may present challenges in interpretation of these studies. For example, “maximal” voluntary muscle contraction and voluntarily chosen training load are variable across subjects.61,62 On the other hand, “running economy,” the oxygen cost associated with a given running velocity, has low variability among highly trained runners and is significantly correlated with cardiorespiratory parameters used to assess aerobic capacity.63 A meta-analysis of the reliability of various measures of muscle power previously identified that field running tests tended to be more reliable than treadmill running tests, tests lasting up to 1 minute tended to be more reliable than those lasting greater than 1 minute (likely due to increased variability in muscle movement and limb positioning), and isokinetic tests tended to be more reliable when measuring muscle extension versus flexion.62 Somewhat reassuringly in the context of the present review, this metaanalysis also found that measurements taken from athletes were more reliable than those taken from non-athlete subjects. With respect to the validity of outcome measures reported as performance indicators, the nature of the sport (eg, team vs individual) may be an important determinant of whether what is measured in the laboratory translates to the actual game. For instance, for team-based sports requiring complex game structure such as soccer, measures of muscle force production or running speed are likely insufficient to provide an accurate assessment of in-game performance, although they may be helpful in making gross approximations and predictions.64 Of course, actual performance metrics from real or simulated games would be the ideal outcomes to quantify for such sports in future investigations. More specifically, for performance outcomes included in the current review, the following have been independently validated and shown to be reliable measures of athletic performance: Yo-Yo intermittent recovery (YYIR) test, isometric muscle contraction, squat, countermovement jump, free sthrow basketball shooting, tennis serving, shuttle-running tests, and Wingate test.42–48 In Table 1, we have indicated studies employing previously validated and reliable metrics of objective performance with asterisks (as per the criteria discussed above). Still, more work will be required to further validate the various performance outcomes measured in the studies reviewed in the present work, especially those involving complex, team-based measures such as composite game performance scores and passing accuracy. Likewise, given the high inter-individual variability of sleep variables used across the included studies, these metrics will also require further investigation to determine their precision and reliability as predictors of athletic performance. Importantly, we chose to require at least one objective performance measure among our inclusion criteria. The previous work relying on self-perceived performance, although informative in understanding the potential effect of sleep loss or gain on sports psychology,15 may not accurately reflect actual performance, as was the goal of the present work. However, under certain circumstances, self-perceived pre-game wellness (including self-reported sleep quality) may be predictive of objective in-game performance.65 More research will be needed to assess the validity of playerreported performance and objective performance, especially when athletes exhibit compromised sleep. Several experimental studies are particularly illustrative of the various trends in the results we have just outlined. To address the question of whether one night of sleep extension would be sufficient to improve various fitness indices among semi-professional soccer players, Fullagar et al15 tested a sleep hygiene intervention. The investigators implemented a sleep hygiene strategy (SHS) designed to maximize sleep duration and limit stimulation before bedtime to test whether this would be sufficient to improve either anaerobic (jumping height and force production) or aerobic endurance (Yo–Yo intermittent recovery level 2, YYIR2) performance after latenight soccer matches. Implementing a randomized design, they assigned 20 participants to follow either their normal post-match sleep routine [non-SHS (NSHS)] or a SHS involving early dimming of lights and lights out by midnight, cool room temperature, and no technology or light stimulation for 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. Actigraphy was used to measure sleep patterns, and sleep diary was used for subjective recall of sleep quality. Despite finding that those assigned to the SHS indeed exhibited increased sleep duration after the night match relative to those in the NSHS group, the investigators failed to identify any improvements in countermovement jump height, countermovement jump force production, or YYIR2 performance, tested over the following 2 days. On the other hand, as we have discussed, studies of acute sleep deprivation, especially those measuring technical performance outcomes, tended to yield positive results. Given that sleep is often disrupted the night before athletic competition,66 athletes involved in sports requiring these types of skills are likely to be particularly sensitive to sleep manipulations and thus should be counseled regarding the importance of sleep for game performance. Relatedly, chronic sleep extension studies have demonstrated significant benefits to athletes.35,49 Thus, strategies to improve sleep not only the night before an important sports event but also in the weeks leading up to this event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance. In this review, we have summarized and synthesized recent findings in the realm of sports and sleep science. One of the challenges of conducting such a literature review is that the study methodologies vary a great deal, as do the individual sports, making comparisons of effects and magnitudes of effect sizes across studies difficult. Additionally, unlike many studies of athletic performance and sleep conducted in nonathletes and recreational sports players, studies incorporating high-level competitors are limited, especially those implementing experimental approaches. Even among the best-controlled studies, sample sizes are small and sleep measurements vary considerably, with some studies measuring sleep duration objectively through polysomnography or actigraphy and others relying on self-report. All of these factors limit the scope of the conclusions that can be drawn. Nevertheless, they do provide valuable information about when sleep does or particularly when sleep does not seem to play a key role in influencing performance. Future research may seek to use larger sample sizes and standardize tests of athletic performance in order to identify optimal sleep standards, in addition to standardizing sleep metrics and incorporating more objective sleep data. In particular, here we focused on studies investigating sleep duration, although sleep timing is likely to be a relevant factor as well. As sleep onset and wake time have previously been shown to influence performance and recovery,5 future studies should aim to incorporate this information. Given these suggestions for improving future research, there are many opportunities for innovative research on this topic. One area in particular may be about how generalizable these findings are to other sports. Given the wide range of methodologies and used in these studies, another research goal would be to harmonize measures across studies and conduct a meta-analysis. Another area to investigate is trade-offs between wake time activities (eg, athletic practice) and sleep. For example, is it beneficial for swimmers to practice early in the morning even at the expense of their sleep? Research also should seek to investigate the mechanisms by which aerobic, tactical, and technical performance attributes may be preferentially sensitive to changes in sleep patterns. One limitation of the present work is that although the number of hours and/or nights of sleep interventions across studies varied, sleep duration was only measured the night before performance assessment. Thus, in order to obtain a more complete picture of sleep quantity and quality, future research should aim to measure sleep across the entire study period. Another limitation is that few of the studies examined explicitly the relationship between subjective sleep quality and performance, especially using validated sleep quality questionnaires such as the PSQI and ESS. Thus, this remains an open question that will be important to be investigated in the future. Once all these data are gathered, feasible and effective interventions should be developed, implemented, and evaluated to improve the sleep health and optimal performance of athletes. In conclusion, the importance of sleep for professional athletes to achieve high performance varies by the cognitive and physical demands of the sport. However, because most sports require integration of aerobic fitness, tactical skills, and technical skills, competitive athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration.  \\n   \n",

                              In this study, researchers compared the effects of food cue and stress exposure on highly palatable (HP) food intake in a controlled human laboratory experiment. They found that exposure to both food cues and stressors resulted in increased HP food craving and subsequent snacking of HP foods. The study also identified differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin and cortisol responses in lean and overweight individuals. The findings suggest a need for further investigation into the biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations. #foodintake #HPfoods #stress #biobehavioralprocesses #obesityrisk   \n",

The study also showed differential effects by BMI, with stress only increasing food craving in the overweight group. Ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. These findings suggest a need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations. #foodcraving #stress #highlypalatablefoods #obesityrisk #biobehavioralprocesses #BMI #ghrelin #cortisol   \n",

In a groundbreaking study, researchers looked at the effects of food cue and stress exposure on highly palatable (HP) food craving and intake. They found that exposure to both personal food cues and stressors resulted in increased HP food craving and subsequent snacking of HP foods, with differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups. Ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation, with different effects across lean and overweight individuals. These findings suggest the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations. #foodcraving #stress #HPfoodintake #obesity #biobehavioralprocesses   \n",

                   In a preliminary study, exposure to both food cues and stress increased highly palatable snack intake, with differential effects in lean and overweight individuals. Ghrelin and cortisol responses were found to impact food motivation but varied across BMI groups. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into the biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations. #nutrition #obesity #foodintake #biobehavioralprocesses   \n",

       "text           Food craving, cortisol and ghrelin responses in modeling highly palatable snack intake in the laboratory\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nThis preliminary study is the first to directly compare the effects of both food cue and stress exposure on HP food craving and HP food intake in a 3-day human laboratory experiment conducted within a controlled hospital-based setting with healthy community adults. As both the ubiquitous HP food environment and stressors are known to increase HP food intake and obesity risk, a direct comparison of these contexts could identify similar and differential processes that may underlie food motivation and intake. As hypothesized, and similar to our previous work in addiction [18], we found that exposure to both personal food cues and to personal stressors relative to a neutral relaxing control cue resulted in increases in HP food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods in a standardized Food Snack Test (FST), but with differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups. Furthermore, we found that increased food craving in these contexts was highly associated with subsequent amounts of HP food snack intake. Finally, both ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. Together, these results support the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.\\nExposure to food cue imagery led to significant increases in HP food craving prior to the presentation of the FST at the pre-snack timepoint in both lean and OW individuals. Moreover, food cue-related increases in food craving predicted significant increases in HP snack intake across both lean and OW individuals. These data are consistent with a significant literature indicating that rewarding stimuli and their related contexts increase motivation and wanting of rewarding stimuli via conditioning and/or incentive salience mechanisms [4, 20, 42]. Also, a number of basic science and human neuroimaging studies have shown that food cue stimulus exposure increases food craving and activate brain reward and motivation regions [4, 7-11, 18, 43, 44]. Current findings further indicate that such food cue-related increases in HP food craving promote HP snack intake with greater intake of HP foods in the food cue context relative to the neutral relaxing contexts across individuals. These data validate the real-world contexts of advertising of HP foods to promote greater sales and intake of HP foods.\\nIn contrast, we found a differential impact of stress on HP food craving and intake by BMI group where stress significantly increased food craving relative to the neutral condition, but only in the overweight and not the lean group. Furthermore, stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group, suggesting that food motivational processes may be relevant in identifying those who are vulnerable to stress-induced eating. Previous laboratory studies have shown mixed results with some showing stress increasing food intake [17, 24], but others reporting no consistent increases in intake [23, 45]. While the methodology has varied across these studies, current findings suggest the need for direct comparison of BMI groups and consideration of weight-related adaptations in assessing stress effects on HP food motivation and intake. Current findings are also supported by a growing literature suggesting that BMI-related alterations impact not only metabolic hormones but also stress and reward processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake [18, 20, 44]. Together our findings on food cue- and stress- related effects on HP food motivation and intake suggests differential effects by BMI, that may in turn, point to different mechanisms that may drive weight gain and obesity risk in individuals who are lean versus those who are overweight.\\nOur findings also show differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin responses and their contribution to HP food motivation and intake. Stress and food cue exposure increased ghrelin responses, but significantly for the OW and not the LN group. Furthermore, only in the OW group was stress-induced ghrelin increases significantly associated with both HP food craving and subsequent HP food intake. While ghrelin has well known homeostatic effects on feeding function [46, 47], recent focus has been on its role in both stress and mood regulation as well as in hedonically motivated feeding behavior, partially via its effects on mesolimbic reward circuits [37, 48]. Findings indicate that ghrelin can shift preferences to high palatable foods and increase the motivational aspects of food reward [48]. Ghrelin is also known to increase with stress and is involved in regulating anxiety and mood (36, 49-51). Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that ghrelin administration increases the neural response to food pictures in areas associated with hedonic eating (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and ventral tegmental area) [52]. Additionally, there is growing evidence that feed-forward circuitry between stress and food reward maybe partly mediated by ghrelin [52, 53]. In the current study, as the effects were specific to the OW group, they suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions.\\nFinally, our findings also showed differential effects of cortisol responses to stress and food cue exposure. Notably, there was a significant increase in cortisol in the food cue relative to the neutral condition that was due to significant increases in cortisol in the lean group and not so in the OW group. Furthermore, food cue-related increases in cortisol was associated with greater food cue-related HP craving, suggesting a role for cortisol in food motivation. While glucocorticoids are often associated with the stress response, they are also known to play an important role in energy intake and regulation. Cortisol increases have been noted with intake of specific macronutrients, including carbohydrates, fats and proteins in animals and humans [6, 54], with the source of cortisol increases to be via both adrenal and extra-adrenal production [54]. Furthermore, in our previous neuroimaging study, increases in cortisol during a mild hypoglycemic state was associated with greater activation of brain reward regions that promoted greater food craving [44]. Together, this previous research supports current findings of the association between greater cortisol responses to food cue exposure with food cue-induced HP food craving.\\nWe did not see an overall significant increase in cortisol during stress exposure, but this was largely due to a lack of response in the OW group. Remarkably, the OW group showed blunted cortisol responses during stress and food cue relative to neutral conditions. This finding is consistent with growing evidence of blunted cortisol and autonomic responses to stress challenge in people who are OW or obese, along with altered autonomic and peripheral catecholamine responses to stress challenge in those weight groups [18, 21-25, 55]. HPA axis adaptations with low cortisol awakening responses have been reported in higher BMI groups, along with blunted responses to stress and reduced dopamine activity [20, 56]. Thus, the current findings of lack of cortisol increases in the OW group leads one to speculate that such HPA axis adaptations may contribute to higher HP food craving and intake in food cue and in stress contexts. However, this is speculation and would need further testing in future studies.\\nSeveral limitations of the current study need to be considered. First, the sample size was small and thus the findings are preliminary and need further validation. Also, due to the small sample size, sex differences and differential responses within the overweight groups were not assessed. It is possible that men and women differ in their food motivation and intake responses in food cue and stress contexts as shown in previous work [26,27]. Also, continuous assessment of BMI rather than arbitrary cutoffs for individuals in the lean, overweight and obese BMI range may provide greater sensitivity in assessing weight related adaptations. Thus, research with larger samples is required to replicate current findings and address these issues. Finally, as this study was conducted while participants were in a hospital, it is not clear whether the findings are generalizable to an outpatient experimental context or to real world food motivation and intake settings. On the other hand, as food cues and stress are among the most common contexts in which overeating of HP foods occur in the real world, the current study presents a well-controlled experimental model to study the biobehavioral processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake of highly palatable foods. Evidence of HP food motivation and increased snacking in these contexts is consistent with reports of obesogenic environments promoting increased HP food intake and weight gain in the real world. Furthermore, positive associations of HP food craving and intake by total ghrelin and cortisol responses suggests a role for metabolic and neuroendocrine adaptations in increased HP food motivation and intake.\\n   \n",

                                           A new study conducted in a controlled hospital-based setting has found that exposure to both food cues and stressors increases highly palatable food craving and subsequent snacking of such foods. The study also found differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin and cortisol responses, with ghrelin shifts potentially impacting food motivation towards hedonic regulation under stress conditions. The findings suggest the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying highly palatable food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations. #foodcraving #obesity #biobehavioralprocesses #foodmotivation #HPfoods   \n",

that exposure to food cues and stress can increase cravings and intake of highly palatable (HP) foods, leading to obesity risk. The study found that food cue-related increases in food craving predicted significant increases in HP snack intake, and stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in overweight individuals. Furthermore, ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation, but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. The results support the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations. #Obesity #HighlyPalatableFoods #FoodCravings #Stress #Research   \n",

                     This study compared the effects of food cue and stress exposure on highly palatable food craving and intake in healthy adults. Results showed that exposure to both contexts increased cravings and subsequent snacking of these foods, with differential effects in lean and overweight individuals. Ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation, with weight-related adaptations potentially contributing to increased food craving and intake. The study provides insights into the biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations. #foodcravings #obesity #biobehavioralprocesses #highlypalatablefoods #nutritionresearch   \n",

                                            This study explored the effects of food cues and stress on highly palatable snack intake and found that exposure to both resulted in increased food craving and subsequent snacking. The study also found differential effects on lean and overweight BMI groups, with stress-induced food craving only affecting the overweight group. Additionally, ghrelin and cortisol responses were found to impact food motivation differently across BMI groups. These findings suggest the need for further investigation into the biobehavioral processes underlying food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations. #foodcraving #stress #BMI #obesity #biobehavioralprocesses   \n",

As both the ubiquitous HP food environment and stressors are known to increase HP food intake and obesity risk, a direct comparison of these contexts could identify similar and differential processes that may underlie food motivation and intake. As hypothesized, and similar to our previous work in addiction [18], we found that exposure to both personal food cues and to personal stressors relative to a neutral relaxing control cue resulted in increases in HP food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods in a standardized Food Snack Test (FST), but with differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups. Furthermore, we found that increased food craving in these contexts was highly associated with subsequent amounts of HP food snack intake. Finally, both ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. Together, these results support the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.\\nExposure to food cue imagery led to significant increases in HP food craving prior to the presentation of the FST at the pre-snack timepoint in both lean and OW individuals. Moreover, food cue-related increases in food craving predicted significant increases in HP snack intake across both lean and OW individuals. These data are consistent with a significant literature indicating that rewarding stimuli and their related contexts increase motivation and wanting of rewarding stimuli via conditioning and/or incentive salience mechanisms [4, 20, 42]. Also, a number of basic science and human neuroimaging studies have shown that food cue stimulus exposure increases food craving and activate brain reward and motivation regions [4, 7-11, 18, 43, 44]. Current findings further indicate that such food cue-related increases in HP food craving promote HP snack intake with greater intake of HP foods in the food cue context relative to the neutral relaxing contexts across individuals. These data validate the real-world contexts of advertising of HP foods to promote greater sales and intake of HP foods.\\nIn contrast, we found a differential impact of stress on HP food craving and intake by BMI group where stress significantly increased food craving relative to the neutral condition, but only in the overweight and not the lean group. Furthermore, stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group, suggesting that food motivational processes may be relevant in identifying those who are vulnerable to stress-induced eating. Previous laboratory studies have shown mixed results with some showing stress increasing food intake [17, 24], but others reporting no consistent increases in intake [23, 45]. While the methodology has varied across these studies, current findings suggest the need for direct comparison of BMI groups and consideration of weight-related adaptations in assessing stress effects on HP food motivation and intake. Current findings are also supported by a growing literature suggesting that BMI-related alterations impact not only metabolic hormones but also stress and reward processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake [18, 20, 44]. Together our findings on food cue- and stress- related effects on HP food motivation and intake suggests differential effects by BMI, that may in turn, point to different mechanisms that may drive weight gain and obesity risk in individuals who are lean versus those who are overweight.\\nOur findings also show differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin responses and their contribution to HP food motivation and intake. Stress and food cue exposure increased ghrelin responses, but significantly for the OW and not the LN group. Furthermore, only in the OW group was stress-induced ghrelin increases significantly associated with both HP food craving and subsequent HP food intake. While ghrelin has well known homeostatic effects on feeding function [46, 47], recent focus has been on its role in both stress and mood regulation as well as in hedonically motivated feeding behavior, partially via its effects on mesolimbic reward circuits [37, 48]. Findings indicate that ghrelin can shift preferences to high palatable foods and increase the motivational aspects of food reward [48]. Ghrelin is also known to increase with stress and is involved in regulating anxiety and mood (36, 49-51). Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that ghrelin administration increases the neural response to food pictures in areas associated with hedonic eating (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and ventral tegmental area) [52]. Additionally, there is growing evidence that feed-forward circuitry between stress and food reward maybe partly mediated by ghrelin [52, 53]. In the current study, as the effects were specific to the OW group, they suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions.\\nFinally, our findings also showed differential effects of cortisol responses to stress and food cue exposure. Notably, there was a significant increase in cortisol in the food cue relative to the neutral condition that was due to significant increases in cortisol in the lean group and not so in the OW group. Furthermore, food cue-related increases in cortisol was associated with greater food cue-related HP craving, suggesting a role for cortisol in food motivation. While glucocorticoids are often associated with the stress response, they are also known to play an important role in energy intake and regulation. Cortisol increases have been noted with intake of specific macronutrients, including carbohydrates, fats and proteins in animals and humans [6, 54], with the source of cortisol increases to be via both adrenal and extra-adrenal production [54]. Furthermore, in our previous neuroimaging study, increases in cortisol during a mild hypoglycemic state was associated with greater activation of brain reward regions that promoted greater food craving [44]. Together, this previous research supports current findings of the association between greater cortisol responses to food cue exposure with food cue-induced HP food craving.\\nWe did not see an overall significant increase in cortisol during stress exposure, but this was largely due to a lack of response in the OW group. Remarkably, the OW group showed blunted cortisol responses during stress and food cue relative to neutral conditions. This finding is consistent with growing evidence of blunted cortisol and autonomic responses to stress challenge in people who are OW or obese, along with altered autonomic and peripheral catecholamine responses to stress challenge in those weight groups [18, 21-25, 55]. HPA axis adaptations with low cortisol awakening responses have been reported in higher BMI groups, along with blunted responses to stress and reduced dopamine activity [20, 56]. Thus, the current findings of lack of cortisol increases in the OW group leads one to speculate that such HPA axis adaptations may contribute to higher HP food craving and intake in food cue and in stress contexts. However, this is speculation and would need further testing in future studies.\\nSeveral limitations of the current study need to be considered. First, the sample size was small and thus the findings are preliminary and need further validation. Also, due to the small sample size, sex differences and differential responses within the overweight groups were not assessed. It is possible that men and women differ in their food motivation and intake responses in food cue and stress contexts as shown in previous work [26,27]. Also, continuous assessment of BMI rather than arbitrary cutoffs for individuals in the lean, overweight and obese BMI range may provide greater sensitivity in assessing weight related adaptations. Thus, research with larger samples is required to replicate current findings and address these issues. Finally, as this study was conducted while participants were in a hospital, it is not clear whether the findings are generalizable to an outpatient experimental context or to real world food motivation and intake settings. On the other hand, as food cues and stress are among the most common contexts in which overeating of HP foods occur in the real world, the current study presents a well-controlled experimental model to study the biobehavioral processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake of highly palatable foods. Evidence of HP food motivation and increased snacking in these contexts is consistent with reports of obesogenic environments promoting increased HP food intake and weight gain in the real world. Furthermore, positive associations of HP food craving and intake by total ghrelin and cortisol responses suggests a role for metabolic and neuroendocrine adaptations in increased HP food motivation and intake.\\n   \n",

                                             Hey, did you know that a recent study found that exposure to both food cues and stressors can increase food cravings and snacking of highly palatable foods? The study also showed that these effects were different in lean and overweight individuals, with stress-induced food cravings only being significant in the overweight group. The study also found that ghrelin and cortisol had differential effects on food motivation and intake, with ghrelin showing a stronger association with increased HP food intake in the overweight group. This study sheds light on the biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.   \n",

know that a new study found that exposure to both food cues and stressors can increase highly palatable (HP) food craving and subsequent intake? The study was conducted in a controlled hospital-based setting with healthy community adults, and found that food cue-related increases in HP food craving led to greater intake of HP foods in the food cue context relative to the neutral relaxing contexts across individuals. Additionally, they found that stress significantly increased food craving relative to the neutral condition, but only in the overweight group. The study also looked at the impact of ghrelin and cortisol responses on food motivation, and found that both hormones had differential effects on lean and overweight individuals. Overall, the study suggests that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin and cortisol modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions.   \n",

about a recent study that investigated the effects of food cue and stress exposure on highly palatable (HP) food intake? The study found that exposure to both personal food cues and stressors resulted in increases in HP food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods. Interestingly, the effects of food cue and stress exposure on HP food motivation and intake were found to be differential across lean and overweight BMI groups. Moreover, the study showed that ghrelin and cortisol significantly impacted food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. The findings suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions. The study offers insights into the biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.   \n",

                                Hey there! I just read a really interesting study about food cravings and stress in relation to snacking on highly palatable foods. The study found that exposure to both personal food cues and stressors increased cravings for these types of snacks and led to increased snacking in both lean and overweight individuals. However, stress only increased cravings in overweight individuals. Additionally, the study found that both ghrelin and cortisol played a role in food motivation but had differential effects across BMI groups. Ghrelin was found to impact food reward and motivation in overweight individuals under stress, while cortisol was associated with food cue-induced cravings in lean individuals. Overall, this study highlights the need for further investigation into the biobehavioral processes underlying food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.   \n",

and stressors can increase highly palatable (HP) food intake and obesity risk? The study compared the effects of food cue and stress exposure on HP food craving and HP food intake in a 3-day human laboratory experiment. They found that exposure to food cue imagery led to significant increases in HP food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods. Stress also significantly increased food craving, but only in the overweight group. Furthermore, the study found that both ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. The overweight group showed blunted cortisol responses during stress and food cue relative to neutral conditions, which could contribute to higher HP food craving and intake in food cue and in stress contexts. The study suggests that further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake is needed.   \n",

As both the ubiquitous HP food environment and stressors are known to increase HP food intake and obesity risk, a direct comparison of these contexts could identify similar and differential processes that may underlie food motivation and intake. As hypothesized, and similar to our previous work in addiction [18], we found that exposure to both personal food cues and to personal stressors relative to a neutral relaxing control cue resulted in increases in HP food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods in a standardized Food Snack Test (FST), but with differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups. Furthermore, we found that increased food craving in these contexts was highly associated with subsequent amounts of HP food snack intake. Finally, both ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. Together, these results support the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.\\nExposure to food cue imagery led to significant increases in HP food craving prior to the presentation of the FST at the pre-snack timepoint in both lean and OW individuals. Moreover, food cue-related increases in food craving predicted significant increases in HP snack intake across both lean and OW individuals. These data are consistent with a significant literature indicating that rewarding stimuli and their related contexts increase motivation and wanting of rewarding stimuli via conditioning and/or incentive salience mechanisms [4, 20, 42]. Also, a number of basic science and human neuroimaging studies have shown that food cue stimulus exposure increases food craving and activate brain reward and motivation regions [4, 7-11, 18, 43, 44]. Current findings further indicate that such food cue-related increases in HP food craving promote HP snack intake with greater intake of HP foods in the food cue context relative to the neutral relaxing contexts across individuals. These data validate the real-world contexts of advertising of HP foods to promote greater sales and intake of HP foods.\\nIn contrast, we found a differential impact of stress on HP food craving and intake by BMI group where stress significantly increased food craving relative to the neutral condition, but only in the overweight and not the lean group. Furthermore, stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group, suggesting that food motivational processes may be relevant in identifying those who are vulnerable to stress-induced eating. Previous laboratory studies have shown mixed results with some showing stress increasing food intake [17, 24], but others reporting no consistent increases in intake [23, 45]. While the methodology has varied across these studies, current findings suggest the need for direct comparison of BMI groups and consideration of weight-related adaptations in assessing stress effects on HP food motivation and intake. Current findings are also supported by a growing literature suggesting that BMI-related alterations impact not only metabolic hormones but also stress and reward processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake [18, 20, 44]. Together our findings on food cue- and stress- related effects on HP food motivation and intake suggests differential effects by BMI, that may in turn, point to different mechanisms that may drive weight gain and obesity risk in individuals who are lean versus those who are overweight.\\nOur findings also show differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin responses and their contribution to HP food motivation and intake. Stress and food cue exposure increased ghrelin responses, but significantly for the OW and not the LN group. Furthermore, only in the OW group was stress-induced ghrelin increases significantly associated with both HP food craving and subsequent HP food intake. While ghrelin has well known homeostatic effects on feeding function [46, 47], recent focus has been on its role in both stress and mood regulation as well as in hedonically motivated feeding behavior, partially via its effects on mesolimbic reward circuits [37, 48]. Findings indicate that ghrelin can shift preferences to high palatable foods and increase the motivational aspects of food reward [48]. Ghrelin is also known to increase with stress and is involved in regulating anxiety and mood (36, 49-51). Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that ghrelin administration increases the neural response to food pictures in areas associated with hedonic eating (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and ventral tegmental area) [52]. Additionally, there is growing evidence that feed-forward circuitry between stress and food reward maybe partly mediated by ghrelin [52, 53]. In the current study, as the effects were specific to the OW group, they suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions.\\nFinally, our findings also showed differential effects of cortisol responses to stress and food cue exposure. Notably, there was a significant increase in cortisol in the food cue relative to the neutral condition that was due to significant increases in cortisol in the lean group and not so in the OW group. Furthermore, food cue-related increases in cortisol was associated with greater food cue-related HP craving, suggesting a role for cortisol in food motivation. While glucocorticoids are often associated with the stress response, they are also known to play an important role in energy intake and regulation. Cortisol increases have been noted with intake of specific macronutrients, including carbohydrates, fats and proteins in animals and humans [6, 54], with the source of cortisol increases to be via both adrenal and extra-adrenal production [54]. Furthermore, in our previous neuroimaging study, increases in cortisol during a mild hypoglycemic state was associated with greater activation of brain reward regions that promoted greater food craving [44]. Together, this previous research supports current findings of the association between greater cortisol responses to food cue exposure with food cue-induced HP food craving.\\nWe did not see an overall significant increase in cortisol during stress exposure, but this was largely due to a lack of response in the OW group. Remarkably, the OW group showed blunted cortisol responses during stress and food cue relative to neutral conditions. This finding is consistent with growing evidence of blunted cortisol and autonomic responses to stress challenge in people who are OW or obese, along with altered autonomic and peripheral catecholamine responses to stress challenge in those weight groups [18, 21-25, 55]. HPA axis adaptations with low cortisol awakening responses have been reported in higher BMI groups, along with blunted responses to stress and reduced dopamine activity [20, 56]. Thus, the current findings of lack of cortisol increases in the OW group leads one to speculate that such HPA axis adaptations may contribute to higher HP food craving and intake in food cue and in stress contexts. However, this is speculation and would need further testing in future studies.\\nSeveral limitations of the current study need to be considered. First, the sample size was small and thus the findings are preliminary and need further validation. Also, due to the small sample size, sex differences and differential responses within the overweight groups were not assessed. It is possible that men and women differ in their food motivation and intake responses in food cue and stress contexts as shown in previous work [26,27]. Also, continuous assessment of BMI rather than arbitrary cutoffs for individuals in the lean, overweight and obese BMI range may provide greater sensitivity in assessing weight related adaptations. Thus, research with larger samples is required to replicate current findings and address these issues. Finally, as this study was conducted while participants were in a hospital, it is not clear whether the findings are generalizable to an outpatient experimental context or to real world food motivation and intake settings. On the other hand, as food cues and stress are among the most common contexts in which overeating of HP foods occur in the real world, the current study presents a well-controlled experimental model to study the biobehavioral processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake of highly palatable foods. Evidence of HP food motivation and increased snacking in these contexts is consistent with reports of obesogenic environments promoting increased HP food intake and weight gain in the real world. Furthermore, positive associations of HP food craving and intake by total ghrelin and cortisol responses suggests a role for metabolic and neuroendocrine adaptations in increased HP food motivation and intake.\\n   \n",

                            Hey, did you hear about this new study on food cravings and stress? It's really interesting! They looked at how exposure to both food cues and stress affects cravings and intake of highly palatable (HP) foods in lean and overweight individuals. They found that exposure to both food cues and stress resulted in increased HP food cravings and subsequent snacking of HP foods in a standardized Food Snack Test (FST). The study also showed that the effects of stress on HP food craving and intake were differential by BMI group, with stress increasing food craving only in the overweight group. Additionally, the study showed that both ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. Overall, the study sheds light on the biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake and highlights the need for further investigation.  \n",

of food cues and stress on highly palatable food intake? The study found that exposure to both food cues and stress led to increased craving and subsequent snacking of highly palatable foods. Interestingly, the effects of stress on food motivation and intake differed by body mass index (BMI) group, with stress-induced increases in food craving predicting subsequent snack intake only in the overweight group. Additionally, the study found that both ghrelin and cortisol were significantly associated with food motivation but differed across lean and overweight individuals. These findings suggest that weight-related adaptations in metabolic and neuroendocrine processes may contribute to increased food motivation and intake of highly palatable foods in different contexts. The study, while small, provides insight into the biobehavioral processes underlying food motivation and may have implications for understanding and preventing obesity.  \n",

study compared the effects of food cue and stress exposure on highly palatable food craving and intake in a controlled hospital-based setting? They found that exposure to both personal food cues and stressors resulted in increased snacking of highly palatable foods, with differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups. Additionally, ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across these groups. The study suggests that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin and cortisol modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions. However, the sample size was small and further research is needed to validate these findings.  \n",

                                                           Hey, did you know that a recent study conducted in a controlled hospital-based setting found that exposure to both personal food cues and stressors led to increased highly palatable snack intake in a standardized Food Snack Test? This study is the first to directly compare the effects of both food cue and stress exposure on HP food craving and intake in a human laboratory experiment. Interestingly, the study found differential effects on food motivation and intake based on BMI, with stress-induced HP food craving predicting subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group. Additionally, the study found that both ghrelin and cortisol significantly impacted food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. The findings suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions. Overall, the study sheds light on the biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake and the need for further investigation.  \n",

food intake? The study was conducted in a controlled hospital-based setting with healthy community adults, and the findings suggest that exposure to personal food cues and stressors increase HP food craving and subsequent snacking of HP foods. Interestingly, the effects were different for lean and overweight BMI groups. Ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation, but again, the effects were different for lean and overweight individuals. Overall, the study sheds light on the biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations. The sample size was small, but the findings are intriguing and call for further research in this area.  \n",

As both the ubiquitous HP food environment and stressors are known to increase HP food intake and obesity risk, a direct comparison of these contexts could identify similar and differential processes that may underlie food motivation and intake. As hypothesized, and similar to our previous work in addiction [18], we found that exposure to both personal food cues and to personal stressors relative to a neutral relaxing control cue resulted in increases in HP food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods in a standardized Food Snack Test (FST), but with differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups. Furthermore, we found that increased food craving in these contexts was highly associated with subsequent amounts of HP food snack intake. Finally, both ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. Together, these results support the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.\\nExposure to food cue imagery led to significant increases in HP food craving prior to the presentation of the FST at the pre-snack timepoint in both lean and OW individuals. Moreover, food cue-related increases in food craving predicted significant increases in HP snack intake across both lean and OW individuals. These data are consistent with a significant literature indicating that rewarding stimuli and their related contexts increase motivation and wanting of rewarding stimuli via conditioning and/or incentive salience mechanisms [4, 20, 42]. Also, a number of basic science and human neuroimaging studies have shown that food cue stimulus exposure increases food craving and activate brain reward and motivation regions [4, 7-11, 18, 43, 44]. Current findings further indicate that such food cue-related increases in HP food craving promote HP snack intake with greater intake of HP foods in the food cue context relative to the neutral relaxing contexts across individuals. These data validate the real-world contexts of advertising of HP foods to promote greater sales and intake of HP foods.\\nIn contrast, we found a differential impact of stress on HP food craving and intake by BMI group where stress significantly increased food craving relative to the neutral condition, but only in the overweight and not the lean group. Furthermore, stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group, suggesting that food motivational processes may be relevant in identifying those who are vulnerable to stress-induced eating. Previous laboratory studies have shown mixed results with some showing stress increasing food intake [17, 24], but others reporting no consistent increases in intake [23, 45]. While the methodology has varied across these studies, current findings suggest the need for direct comparison of BMI groups and consideration of weight-related adaptations in assessing stress effects on HP food motivation and intake. Current findings are also supported by a growing literature suggesting that BMI-related alterations impact not only metabolic hormones but also stress and reward processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake [18, 20, 44]. Together our findings on food cue- and stress- related effects on HP food motivation and intake suggests differential effects by BMI, that may in turn, point to different mechanisms that may drive weight gain and obesity risk in individuals who are lean versus those who are overweight.\\nOur findings also show differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin responses and their contribution to HP food motivation and intake. Stress and food cue exposure increased ghrelin responses, but significantly for the OW and not the LN group. Furthermore, only in the OW group was stress-induced ghrelin increases significantly associated with both HP food craving and subsequent HP food intake. While ghrelin has well known homeostatic effects on feeding function [46, 47], recent focus has been on its role in both stress and mood regulation as well as in hedonically motivated feeding behavior, partially via its effects on mesolimbic reward circuits [37, 48]. Findings indicate that ghrelin can shift preferences to high palatable foods and increase the motivational aspects of food reward [48]. Ghrelin is also known to increase with stress and is involved in regulating anxiety and mood (36, 49-51). Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that ghrelin administration increases the neural response to food pictures in areas associated with hedonic eating (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and ventral tegmental area) [52]. Additionally, there is growing evidence that feed-forward circuitry between stress and food reward maybe partly mediated by ghrelin [52, 53]. In the current study, as the effects were specific to the OW group, they suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions.\\nFinally, our findings also showed differential effects of cortisol responses to stress and food cue exposure. Notably, there was a significant increase in cortisol in the food cue relative to the neutral condition that was due to significant increases in cortisol in the lean group and not so in the OW group. Furthermore, food cue-related increases in cortisol was associated with greater food cue-related HP craving, suggesting a role for cortisol in food motivation. While glucocorticoids are often associated with the stress response, they are also known to play an important role in energy intake and regulation. Cortisol increases have been noted with intake of specific macronutrients, including carbohydrates, fats and proteins in animals and humans [6, 54], with the source of cortisol increases to be via both adrenal and extra-adrenal production [54]. Furthermore, in our previous neuroimaging study, increases in cortisol during a mild hypoglycemic state was associated with greater activation of brain reward regions that promoted greater food craving [44]. Together, this previous research supports current findings of the association between greater cortisol responses to food cue exposure with food cue-induced HP food craving.\\nWe did not see an overall significant increase in cortisol during stress exposure, but this was largely due to a lack of response in the OW group. Remarkably, the OW group showed blunted cortisol responses during stress and food cue relative to neutral conditions. This finding is consistent with growing evidence of blunted cortisol and autonomic responses to stress challenge in people who are OW or obese, along with altered autonomic and peripheral catecholamine responses to stress challenge in those weight groups [18, 21-25, 55]. HPA axis adaptations with low cortisol awakening responses have been reported in higher BMI groups, along with blunted responses to stress and reduced dopamine activity [20, 56]. Thus, the current findings of lack of cortisol increases in the OW group leads one to speculate that such HPA axis adaptations may contribute to higher HP food craving and intake in food cue and in stress contexts. However, this is speculation and would need further testing in future studies.\\nSeveral limitations of the current study need to be considered. First, the sample size was small and thus the findings are preliminary and need further validation. Also, due to the small sample size, sex differences and differential responses within the overweight groups were not assessed. It is possible that men and women differ in their food motivation and intake responses in food cue and stress contexts as shown in previous work [26,27]. Also, continuous assessment of BMI rather than arbitrary cutoffs for individuals in the lean, overweight and obese BMI range may provide greater sensitivity in assessing weight related adaptations. Thus, research with larger samples is required to replicate current findings and address these issues. Finally, as this study was conducted while participants were in a hospital, it is not clear whether the findings are generalizable to an outpatient experimental context or to real world food motivation and intake settings. On the other hand, as food cues and stress are among the most common contexts in which overeating of HP foods occur in the real world, the current study presents a well-controlled experimental model to study the biobehavioral processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake of highly palatable foods. Evidence of HP food motivation and increased snacking in these contexts is consistent with reports of obesogenic environments promoting increased HP food intake and weight gain in the real world. Furthermore, positive associations of HP food craving and intake by total ghrelin and cortisol responses suggests a role for metabolic and neuroendocrine adaptations in increased HP food motivation and intake.\\n  \n",

       "      <td>The Impact of Sleep Duration on Performance Among Competitive Athletes: A Systematic Literature Review\\n\\nDISCUSSION \\nThis literature review, although diverse in the range of sports, methods, and outcomes studied, provides several stylized facts that can inform sleep research and competitive athletes. First, out of all the published studies we reviewed, none found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome. All of the results reviewed showed that either the increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Note that among studies reporting significant positive results, effect sizes varied considerably (Tables 2-4), likely due to differences in the duration of sleep deprivation/extension experienced as well as differences in outcome measures. Second, when considering the aerobic and anaerobic characteristics of sports, it seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. For instance, Mejri et al40 found that depriving competitive taekwondo boxers of a mere 3 to 4 hours of sleep significantly impaired performance on the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test. By contrast, Blumert et al33 employed a relatively severe sleep deprivation protocol by depriving 9 national-caliber collegiate weightlifters of 24 hours of sleep and yet failed to identify adverse effects on any of the various weightlifting exercises examined. Relatedly, for both endurance and explosive, power-based exercises, it has been well documented that sleep deprivation is associated with increased perceived effort.56–58 Still, the relationship between perceived effort and objective performance has not been widely validated and is a topic for future investigation. Third, of the studies that measured outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills, most find benefits of sleep on performance. Tennis serving accuracy and basketball shooting were both improved by long-term sleep extension interventions,35,39 and tennis serving accuracy suffered when players were deprived of 2 to 2.5 hours of sleep at the beginning of the preceding night.37 Regarding studies conducted in players of team sports that incorporated tactics and decision-based outcomes to a broader extent, soccer as well as rugby players exhibited performance deficits after nights of decreased sleep duration.34 These results are in line with other literature demonstrating clear neurocognitive deficits in the setting of inadequate sleep in the general population, reviewed thoroughly elsewhere.59,60 Finally, when looking at the methodologies of the experimental studies, we found that the studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Interestingly although most acute sleep interventions involved sleep deprivation and yielded positive results, there were inconsistent results among the 2 acute sleep extension studies.15,38 Conversely, the majority of longer-term sleep intervention studies involved sleep extension and showed positive results.35,39,49 Taken together, these findings suggest that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. On the other hand, more research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. The reliability and precision of the various measurements may present challenges in interpretation of these studies. For example, “maximal” voluntary muscle contraction and voluntarily chosen training load are variable across subjects.61,62 On the other hand, “running economy,” the oxygen cost associated with a given running velocity, has low variability among highly trained runners and is significantly correlated with cardiorespiratory parameters used to assess aerobic capacity.63 A meta-analysis of the reliability of various measures of muscle power previously identified that field running tests tended to be more reliable than treadmill running tests, tests lasting up to 1 minute tended to be more reliable than those lasting greater than 1 minute (likely due to increased variability in muscle movement and limb positioning), and isokinetic tests tended to be more reliable when measuring muscle extension versus flexion.62 Somewhat reassuringly in the context of the present review, this metaanalysis also found that measurements taken from athletes were more reliable than those taken from non-athlete subjects. With respect to the validity of outcome measures reported as performance indicators, the nature of the sport (eg, team vs individual) may be an important determinant of whether what is measured in the laboratory translates to the actual game. For instance, for team-based sports requiring complex game structure such as soccer, measures of muscle force production or running speed are likely insufficient to provide an accurate assessment of in-game performance, although they may be helpful in making gross approximations and predictions.64 Of course, actual performance metrics from real or simulated games would be the ideal outcomes to quantify for such sports in future investigations. More specifically, for performance outcomes included in the current review, the following have been independently validated and shown to be reliable measures of athletic performance: Yo-Yo intermittent recovery (YYIR) test, isometric muscle contraction, squat, countermovement jump, free sthrow basketball shooting, tennis serving, shuttle-running tests, and Wingate test.42–48 In Table 1, we have indicated studies employing previously validated and reliable metrics of objective performance with asterisks (as per the criteria discussed above). Still, more work will be required to further validate the various performance outcomes measured in the studies reviewed in the present work, especially those involving complex, team-based measures such as composite game performance scores and passing accuracy. Likewise, given the high inter-individual variability of sleep variables used across the included studies, these metrics will also require further investigation to determine their precision and reliability as predictors of athletic performance. Importantly, we chose to require at least one objective performance measure among our inclusion criteria. The previous work relying on self-perceived performance, although informative in understanding the potential effect of sleep loss or gain on sports psychology,15 may not accurately reflect actual performance, as was the goal of the present work. However, under certain circumstances, self-perceived pre-game wellness (including self-reported sleep quality) may be predictive of objective in-game performance.65 More research will be needed to assess the validity of playerreported performance and objective performance, especially when athletes exhibit compromised sleep. Several experimental studies are particularly illustrative of the various trends in the results we have just outlined. To address the question of whether one night of sleep extension would be sufficient to improve various fitness indices among semi-professional soccer players, Fullagar et al15 tested a sleep hygiene intervention. The investigators implemented a sleep hygiene strategy (SHS) designed to maximize sleep duration and limit stimulation before bedtime to test whether this would be sufficient to improve either anaerobic (jumping height and force production) or aerobic endurance (Yo–Yo intermittent recovery level 2, YYIR2) performance after latenight soccer matches. Implementing a randomized design, they assigned 20 participants to follow either their normal post-match sleep routine [non-SHS (NSHS)] or a SHS involving early dimming of lights and lights out by midnight, cool room temperature, and no technology or light stimulation for 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. Actigraphy was used to measure sleep patterns, and sleep diary was used for subjective recall of sleep quality. Despite finding that those assigned to the SHS indeed exhibited increased sleep duration after the night match relative to those in the NSHS group, the investigators failed to identify any improvements in countermovement jump height, countermovement jump force production, or YYIR2 performance, tested over the following 2 days. On the other hand, as we have discussed, studies of acute sleep deprivation, especially those measuring technical performance outcomes, tended to yield positive results. Given that sleep is often disrupted the night before athletic competition,66 athletes involved in sports requiring these types of skills are likely to be particularly sensitive to sleep manipulations and thus should be counseled regarding the importance of sleep for game performance. Relatedly, chronic sleep extension studies have demonstrated significant benefits to athletes.35,49 Thus, strategies to improve sleep not only the night before an important sports event but also in the weeks leading up to this event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance. In this review, we have summarized and synthesized recent findings in the realm of sports and sleep science. One of the challenges of conducting such a literature review is that the study methodologies vary a great deal, as do the individual sports, making comparisons of effects and magnitudes of effect sizes across studies difficult. Additionally, unlike many studies of athletic performance and sleep conducted in nonathletes and recreational sports players, studies incorporating high-level competitors are limited, especially those implementing experimental approaches. Even among the best-controlled studies, sample sizes are small and sleep measurements vary considerably, with some studies measuring sleep duration objectively through polysomnography or actigraphy and others relying on self-report. All of these factors limit the scope of the conclusions that can be drawn. Nevertheless, they do provide valuable information about when sleep does or particularly when sleep does not seem to play a key role in influencing performance. Future research may seek to use larger sample sizes and standardize tests of athletic performance in order to identify optimal sleep standards, in addition to standardizing sleep metrics and incorporating more objective sleep data. In particular, here we focused on studies investigating sleep duration, although sleep timing is likely to be a relevant factor as well. As sleep onset and wake time have previously been shown to influence performance and recovery,5 future studies should aim to incorporate this information. Given these suggestions for improving future research, there are many opportunities for innovative research on this topic. One area in particular may be about how generalizable these findings are to other sports. Given the wide range of methodologies and used in these studies, another research goal would be to harmonize measures across studies and conduct a meta-analysis. Another area to investigate is trade-offs between wake time activities (eg, athletic practice) and sleep. For example, is it beneficial for swimmers to practice early in the morning even at the expense of their sleep? Research also should seek to investigate the mechanisms by which aerobic, tactical, and technical performance attributes may be preferentially sensitive to changes in sleep patterns. One limitation of the present work is that although the number of hours and/or nights of sleep interventions across studies varied, sleep duration was only measured the night before performance assessment. Thus, in order to obtain a more complete picture of sleep quantity and quality, future research should aim to measure sleep across the entire study period. Another limitation is that few of the studies examined explicitly the relationship between subjective sleep quality and performance, especially using validated sleep quality questionnaires such as the PSQI and ESS. Thus, this remains an open question that will be important to be investigated in the future. Once all these data are gathered, feasible and effective interventions should be developed, implemented, and evaluated to improve the sleep health and optimal performance of athletes. In conclusion, the importance of sleep for professional athletes to achieve high performance varies by the cognitive and physical demands of the sport. However, because most sports require integration of aerobic fitness, tactical skills, and technical skills, competitive athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration.  \\n</td>\n",
       "      <td>The Impact of Sleep Duration on Performance Among Competitive Athletes: A Systematic Literature Review\\n\\nDISCUSSION \\nThis literature review, although diverse in the range of sports, methods, and outcomes studied, provides several stylized facts that can inform sleep research and competitive athletes. First, out of all the published studies we reviewed, none found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome. All of the results reviewed showed that either the increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Note that among studies reporting significant positive results, effect sizes varied considerably (Tables 2-4), likely due to differences in the duration of sleep deprivation/extension experienced as well as differences in outcome measures. Second, when considering the aerobic and anaerobic characteristics of sports, it seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. For instance, Mejri et al40 found that depriving competitive taekwondo boxers of a mere 3 to 4 hours of sleep significantly impaired performance on the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test. By contrast, Blumert et al33 employed a relatively severe sleep deprivation protocol by depriving 9 national-caliber collegiate weightlifters of 24 hours of sleep and yet failed to identify adverse effects on any of the various weightlifting exercises examined. Relatedly, for both endurance and explosive, power-based exercises, it has been well documented that sleep deprivation is associated with increased perceived effort.56–58 Still, the relationship between perceived effort and objective performance has not been widely validated and is a topic for future investigation. Third, of the studies that measured outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills, most find benefits of sleep on performance. Tennis serving accuracy and basketball shooting were both improved by long-term sleep extension interventions,35,39 and tennis serving accuracy suffered when players were deprived of 2 to 2.5 hours of sleep at the beginning of the preceding night.37 Regarding studies conducted in players of team sports that incorporated tactics and decision-based outcomes to a broader extent, soccer as well as rugby players exhibited performance deficits after nights of decreased sleep duration.34 These results are in line with other literature demonstrating clear neurocognitive deficits in the setting of inadequate sleep in the general population, reviewed thoroughly elsewhere.59,60 Finally, when looking at the methodologies of the experimental studies, we found that the studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Interestingly although most acute sleep interventions involved sleep deprivation and yielded positive results, there were inconsistent results among the 2 acute sleep extension studies.15,38 Conversely, the majority of longer-term sleep intervention studies involved sleep extension and showed positive results.35,39,49 Taken together, these findings suggest that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. On the other hand, more research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. The reliability and precision of the various measurements may present challenges in interpretation of these studies. For example, “maximal” voluntary muscle contraction and voluntarily chosen training load are variable across subjects.61,62 On the other hand, “running economy,” the oxygen cost associated with a given running velocity, has low variability among highly trained runners and is significantly correlated with cardiorespiratory parameters used to assess aerobic capacity.63 A meta-analysis of the reliability of various measures of muscle power previously identified that field running tests tended to be more reliable than treadmill running tests, tests lasting up to 1 minute tended to be more reliable than those lasting greater than 1 minute (likely due to increased variability in muscle movement and limb positioning), and isokinetic tests tended to be more reliable when measuring muscle extension versus flexion.62 Somewhat reassuringly in the context of the present review, this metaanalysis also found that measurements taken from athletes were more reliable than those taken from non-athlete subjects. With respect to the validity of outcome measures reported as performance indicators, the nature of the sport (eg, team vs individual) may be an important determinant of whether what is measured in the laboratory translates to the actual game. For instance, for team-based sports requiring complex game structure such as soccer, measures of muscle force production or running speed are likely insufficient to provide an accurate assessment of in-game performance, although they may be helpful in making gross approximations and predictions.64 Of course, actual performance metrics from real or simulated games would be the ideal outcomes to quantify for such sports in future investigations. More specifically, for performance outcomes included in the current review, the following have been independently validated and shown to be reliable measures of athletic performance: Yo-Yo intermittent recovery (YYIR) test, isometric muscle contraction, squat, countermovement jump, free sthrow basketball shooting, tennis serving, shuttle-running tests, and Wingate test.42–48 In Table 1, we have indicated studies employing previously validated and reliable metrics of objective performance with asterisks (as per the criteria discussed above). Still, more work will be required to further validate the various performance outcomes measured in the studies reviewed in the present work, especially those involving complex, team-based measures such as composite game performance scores and passing accuracy. Likewise, given the high inter-individual variability of sleep variables used across the included studies, these metrics will also require further investigation to determine their precision and reliability as predictors of athletic performance. Importantly, we chose to require at least one objective performance measure among our inclusion criteria. The previous work relying on self-perceived performance, although informative in understanding the potential effect of sleep loss or gain on sports psychology,15 may not accurately reflect actual performance, as was the goal of the present work. However, under certain circumstances, self-perceived pre-game wellness (including self-reported sleep quality) may be predictive of objective in-game performance.65 More research will be needed to assess the validity of playerreported performance and objective performance, especially when athletes exhibit compromised sleep. Several experimental studies are particularly illustrative of the various trends in the results we have just outlined. To address the question of whether one night of sleep extension would be sufficient to improve various fitness indices among semi-professional soccer players, Fullagar et al15 tested a sleep hygiene intervention. The investigators implemented a sleep hygiene strategy (SHS) designed to maximize sleep duration and limit stimulation before bedtime to test whether this would be sufficient to improve either anaerobic (jumping height and force production) or aerobic endurance (Yo–Yo intermittent recovery level 2, YYIR2) performance after latenight soccer matches. Implementing a randomized design, they assigned 20 participants to follow either their normal post-match sleep routine [non-SHS (NSHS)] or a SHS involving early dimming of lights and lights out by midnight, cool room temperature, and no technology or light stimulation for 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. Actigraphy was used to measure sleep patterns, and sleep diary was used for subjective recall of sleep quality. Despite finding that those assigned to the SHS indeed exhibited increased sleep duration after the night match relative to those in the NSHS group, the investigators failed to identify any improvements in countermovement jump height, countermovement jump force production, or YYIR2 performance, tested over the following 2 days. On the other hand, as we have discussed, studies of acute sleep deprivation, especially those measuring technical performance outcomes, tended to yield positive results. Given that sleep is often disrupted the night before athletic competition,66 athletes involved in sports requiring these types of skills are likely to be particularly sensitive to sleep manipulations and thus should be counseled regarding the importance of sleep for game performance. Relatedly, chronic sleep extension studies have demonstrated significant benefits to athletes.35,49 Thus, strategies to improve sleep not only the night before an important sports event but also in the weeks leading up to this event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance. In this review, we have summarized and synthesized recent findings in the realm of sports and sleep science. One of the challenges of conducting such a literature review is that the study methodologies vary a great deal, as do the individual sports, making comparisons of effects and magnitudes of effect sizes across studies difficult. Additionally, unlike many studies of athletic performance and sleep conducted in nonathletes and recreational sports players, studies incorporating high-level competitors are limited, especially those implementing experimental approaches. Even among the best-controlled studies, sample sizes are small and sleep measurements vary considerably, with some studies measuring sleep duration objectively through polysomnography or actigraphy and others relying on self-report. All of these factors limit the scope of the conclusions that can be drawn. Nevertheless, they do provide valuable information about when sleep does or particularly when sleep does not seem to play a key role in influencing performance. Future research may seek to use larger sample sizes and standardize tests of athletic performance in order to identify optimal sleep standards, in addition to standardizing sleep metrics and incorporating more objective sleep data. In particular, here we focused on studies investigating sleep duration, although sleep timing is likely to be a relevant factor as well. As sleep onset and wake time have previously been shown to influence performance and recovery,5 future studies should aim to incorporate this information. Given these suggestions for improving future research, there are many opportunities for innovative research on this topic. One area in particular may be about how generalizable these findings are to other sports. Given the wide range of methodologies and used in these studies, another research goal would be to harmonize measures across studies and conduct a meta-analysis. Another area to investigate is trade-offs between wake time activities (eg, athletic practice) and sleep. For example, is it beneficial for swimmers to practice early in the morning even at the expense of their sleep? Research also should seek to investigate the mechanisms by which aerobic, tactical, and technical performance attributes may be preferentially sensitive to changes in sleep patterns. One limitation of the present work is that although the number of hours and/or nights of sleep interventions across studies varied, sleep duration was only measured the night before performance assessment. Thus, in order to obtain a more complete picture of sleep quantity and quality, future research should aim to measure sleep across the entire study period. Another limitation is that few of the studies examined explicitly the relationship between subjective sleep quality and performance, especially using validated sleep quality questionnaires such as the PSQI and ESS. Thus, this remains an open question that will be important to be investigated in the future. Once all these data are gathered, feasible and effective interventions should be developed, implemented, and evaluated to improve the sleep health and optimal performance of athletes. In conclusion, the importance of sleep for professional athletes to achieve high performance varies by the cognitive and physical demands of the sport. However, because most sports require integration of aerobic fitness, tactical skills, and technical skills, competitive athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration.  \\n</td>\n",
       "      <td>Food craving, cortisol and ghrelin responses in modeling highly palatable snack intake in the laboratory\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nThis preliminary study is the first to directly compare the effects of both food cue and stress exposure on HP food craving and HP food intake in a 3-day human laboratory experiment conducted within a controlled hospital-based setting with healthy community adults. As both the ubiquitous HP food environment and stressors are known to increase HP food intake and obesity risk, a direct comparison of these contexts could identify similar and differential processes that may underlie food motivation and intake. As hypothesized, and similar to our previous work in addiction [18], we found that exposure to both personal food cues and to personal stressors relative to a neutral relaxing control cue resulted in increases in HP food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods in a standardized Food Snack Test (FST), but with differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups. Furthermore, we found that increased food craving in these contexts was highly associated with subsequent amounts of HP food snack intake. Finally, both ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. Together, these results support the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.\\nExposure to food cue imagery led to significant increases in HP food craving prior to the presentation of the FST at the pre-snack timepoint in both lean and OW individuals. Moreover, food cue-related increases in food craving predicted significant increases in HP snack intake across both lean and OW individuals. These data are consistent with a significant literature indicating that rewarding stimuli and their related contexts increase motivation and wanting of rewarding stimuli via conditioning and/or incentive salience mechanisms [4, 20, 42]. Also, a number of basic science and human neuroimaging studies have shown that food cue stimulus exposure increases food craving and activate brain reward and motivation regions [4, 7-11, 18, 43, 44]. Current findings further indicate that such food cue-related increases in HP food craving promote HP snack intake with greater intake of HP foods in the food cue context relative to the neutral relaxing contexts across individuals. These data validate the real-world contexts of advertising of HP foods to promote greater sales and intake of HP foods.\\nIn contrast, we found a differential impact of stress on HP food craving and intake by BMI group where stress significantly increased food craving relative to the neutral condition, but only in the overweight and not the lean group. Furthermore, stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group, suggesting that food motivational processes may be relevant in identifying those who are vulnerable to stress-induced eating. Previous laboratory studies have shown mixed results with some showing stress increasing food intake [17, 24], but others reporting no consistent increases in intake [23, 45]. While the methodology has varied across these studies, current findings suggest the need for direct comparison of BMI groups and consideration of weight-related adaptations in assessing stress effects on HP food motivation and intake. Current findings are also supported by a growing literature suggesting that BMI-related alterations impact not only metabolic hormones but also stress and reward processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake [18, 20, 44]. Together our findings on food cue- and stress- related effects on HP food motivation and intake suggests differential effects by BMI, that may in turn, point to different mechanisms that may drive weight gain and obesity risk in individuals who are lean versus those who are overweight.\\nOur findings also show differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin responses and their contribution to HP food motivation and intake. Stress and food cue exposure increased ghrelin responses, but significantly for the OW and not the LN group. Furthermore, only in the OW group was stress-induced ghrelin increases significantly associated with both HP food craving and subsequent HP food intake. While ghrelin has well known homeostatic effects on feeding function [46, 47], recent focus has been on its role in both stress and mood regulation as well as in hedonically motivated feeding behavior, partially via its effects on mesolimbic reward circuits [37, 48]. Findings indicate that ghrelin can shift preferences to high palatable foods and increase the motivational aspects of food reward [48]. Ghrelin is also known to increase with stress and is involved in regulating anxiety and mood (36, 49-51). Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that ghrelin administration increases the neural response to food pictures in areas associated with hedonic eating (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and ventral tegmental area) [52]. Additionally, there is growing evidence that feed-forward circuitry between stress and food reward maybe partly mediated by ghrelin [52, 53]. In the current study, as the effects were specific to the OW group, they suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions.\\nFinally, our findings also showed differential effects of cortisol responses to stress and food cue exposure. Notably, there was a significant increase in cortisol in the food cue relative to the neutral condition that was due to significant increases in cortisol in the lean group and not so in the OW group. Furthermore, food cue-related increases in cortisol was associated with greater food cue-related HP craving, suggesting a role for cortisol in food motivation. While glucocorticoids are often associated with the stress response, they are also known to play an important role in energy intake and regulation. Cortisol increases have been noted with intake of specific macronutrients, including carbohydrates, fats and proteins in animals and humans [6, 54], with the source of cortisol increases to be via both adrenal and extra-adrenal production [54]. Furthermore, in our previous neuroimaging study, increases in cortisol during a mild hypoglycemic state was associated with greater activation of brain reward regions that promoted greater food craving [44]. Together, this previous research supports current findings of the association between greater cortisol responses to food cue exposure with food cue-induced HP food craving.\\nWe did not see an overall significant increase in cortisol during stress exposure, but this was largely due to a lack of response in the OW group. Remarkably, the OW group showed blunted cortisol responses during stress and food cue relative to neutral conditions. This finding is consistent with growing evidence of blunted cortisol and autonomic responses to stress challenge in people who are OW or obese, along with altered autonomic and peripheral catecholamine responses to stress challenge in those weight groups [18, 21-25, 55]. HPA axis adaptations with low cortisol awakening responses have been reported in higher BMI groups, along with blunted responses to stress and reduced dopamine activity [20, 56]. Thus, the current findings of lack of cortisol increases in the OW group leads one to speculate that such HPA axis adaptations may contribute to higher HP food craving and intake in food cue and in stress contexts. However, this is speculation and would need further testing in future studies.\\nSeveral limitations of the current study need to be considered. First, the sample size was small and thus the findings are preliminary and need further validation. Also, due to the small sample size, sex differences and differential responses within the overweight groups were not assessed. It is possible that men and women differ in their food motivation and intake responses in food cue and stress contexts as shown in previous work [26,27]. Also, continuous assessment of BMI rather than arbitrary cutoffs for individuals in the lean, overweight and obese BMI range may provide greater sensitivity in assessing weight related adaptations. Thus, research with larger samples is required to replicate current findings and address these issues. Finally, as this study was conducted while participants were in a hospital, it is not clear whether the findings are generalizable to an outpatient experimental context or to real world food motivation and intake settings. On the other hand, as food cues and stress are among the most common contexts in which overeating of HP foods occur in the real world, the current study presents a well-controlled experimental model to study the biobehavioral processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake of highly palatable foods. Evidence of HP food motivation and increased snacking in these contexts is consistent with reports of obesogenic environments promoting increased HP food intake and weight gain in the real world. Furthermore, positive associations of HP food craving and intake by total ghrelin and cortisol responses suggests a role for metabolic and neuroendocrine adaptations in increased HP food motivation and intake.\\n</td>\n",

              Key points:\\n- A systematic literature review found no negative association between sleep duration and athletic performance.\\n- Aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity.\\n- Tactical and technical skills in sports are improved by longer sleep duration.\\n- Sleep deprivation is associated with increased perceived effort but the relationship between perceived effort and objective performance has not been widely validated.\\n- Longer-term sleep extension may contribute to improved performance.\\n- More research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance.\\n\\nNumerical descriptors:\\n- None of the published studies reviewed found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome.\\n- Studies reporting significant positive results had varied effect sizes.\\n- 3 to 4 hours of sleep deprivation significantly impaired performance on the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test.\\n- 9 national-caliber collegiate weightlifters deprived of 24 hours of sleep did not show adverse effects on any of the weightlifting exercises examined.\\n- Tennis serving accuracy and basketball shooting were both improved by long-term sleep extension interventions.\\n- Soccer and rugby players exhibited performance deficits after nights of decreased sleep duration.   \n",

                                New literature review finds that increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance among competitive athletes. None of the studies reviewed found a negative association between sleep duration and performance outcomes. Aerobic activity seems to be more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity. Most studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. The review suggests that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. Strategies to improve sleep not only the night before an important sports event but also in the weeks leading up to this event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance. #sleepscience #athleticperformance #sportsmedicine   \n",

positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. Studies measured outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills, most find benefits of sleep on performance. Longer-term sleep intervention studies involved sleep extension and showed positive results. Sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance on a short timescale. Future research should seek to investigate the mechanisms by which aerobic, tactical, and technical performance attributes may be preferentially sensitive to changes in sleep patterns. Competitive athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration.   \n",

positive impact on athletic performance among competitive athletes. None of the studies reviewed found a negative association. Aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration than anaerobic activity. Measures of tactical and technical skills are improved by sleep extension interventions. Short-term sleep deprivation may be harmful, while long-term sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. More research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. #sportsperformance #sleepduration #athletes\"   \n",

       "text           The Impact of Sleep Duration on Performance Among Competitive Athletes: A Systematic Literature Review\\n\\nDISCUSSION \\nThis literature review, although diverse in the range of sports, methods, and outcomes studied, provides several stylized facts that can inform sleep research and competitive athletes. First, out of all the published studies we reviewed, none found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome. All of the results reviewed showed that either the increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Note that among studies reporting significant positive results, effect sizes varied considerably (Tables 2-4), likely due to differences in the duration of sleep deprivation/extension experienced as well as differences in outcome measures. Second, when considering the aerobic and anaerobic characteristics of sports, it seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. For instance, Mejri et al40 found that depriving competitive taekwondo boxers of a mere 3 to 4 hours of sleep significantly impaired performance on the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test. By contrast, Blumert et al33 employed a relatively severe sleep deprivation protocol by depriving 9 national-caliber collegiate weightlifters of 24 hours of sleep and yet failed to identify adverse effects on any of the various weightlifting exercises examined. Relatedly, for both endurance and explosive, power-based exercises, it has been well documented that sleep deprivation is associated with increased perceived effort.56–58 Still, the relationship between perceived effort and objective performance has not been widely validated and is a topic for future investigation. Third, of the studies that measured outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills, most find benefits of sleep on performance. Tennis serving accuracy and basketball shooting were both improved by long-term sleep extension interventions,35,39 and tennis serving accuracy suffered when players were deprived of 2 to 2.5 hours of sleep at the beginning of the preceding night.37 Regarding studies conducted in players of team sports that incorporated tactics and decision-based outcomes to a broader extent, soccer as well as rugby players exhibited performance deficits after nights of decreased sleep duration.34 These results are in line with other literature demonstrating clear neurocognitive deficits in the setting of inadequate sleep in the general population, reviewed thoroughly elsewhere.59,60 Finally, when looking at the methodologies of the experimental studies, we found that the studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Interestingly although most acute sleep interventions involved sleep deprivation and yielded positive results, there were inconsistent results among the 2 acute sleep extension studies.15,38 Conversely, the majority of longer-term sleep intervention studies involved sleep extension and showed positive results.35,39,49 Taken together, these findings suggest that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. On the other hand, more research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. The reliability and precision of the various measurements may present challenges in interpretation of these studies. For example, “maximal” voluntary muscle contraction and voluntarily chosen training load are variable across subjects.61,62 On the other hand, “running economy,” the oxygen cost associated with a given running velocity, has low variability among highly trained runners and is significantly correlated with cardiorespiratory parameters used to assess aerobic capacity.63 A meta-analysis of the reliability of various measures of muscle power previously identified that field running tests tended to be more reliable than treadmill running tests, tests lasting up to 1 minute tended to be more reliable than those lasting greater than 1 minute (likely due to increased variability in muscle movement and limb positioning), and isokinetic tests tended to be more reliable when measuring muscle extension versus flexion.62 Somewhat reassuringly in the context of the present review, this metaanalysis also found that measurements taken from athletes were more reliable than those taken from non-athlete subjects. With respect to the validity of outcome measures reported as performance indicators, the nature of the sport (eg, team vs individual) may be an important determinant of whether what is measured in the laboratory translates to the actual game. For instance, for team-based sports requiring complex game structure such as soccer, measures of muscle force production or running speed are likely insufficient to provide an accurate assessment of in-game performance, although they may be helpful in making gross approximations and predictions.64 Of course, actual performance metrics from real or simulated games would be the ideal outcomes to quantify for such sports in future investigations. More specifically, for performance outcomes included in the current review, the following have been independently validated and shown to be reliable measures of athletic performance: Yo-Yo intermittent recovery (YYIR) test, isometric muscle contraction, squat, countermovement jump, free sthrow basketball shooting, tennis serving, shuttle-running tests, and Wingate test.42–48 In Table 1, we have indicated studies employing previously validated and reliable metrics of objective performance with asterisks (as per the criteria discussed above). Still, more work will be required to further validate the various performance outcomes measured in the studies reviewed in the present work, especially those involving complex, team-based measures such as composite game performance scores and passing accuracy. Likewise, given the high inter-individual variability of sleep variables used across the included studies, these metrics will also require further investigation to determine their precision and reliability as predictors of athletic performance. Importantly, we chose to require at least one objective performance measure among our inclusion criteria. The previous work relying on self-perceived performance, although informative in understanding the potential effect of sleep loss or gain on sports psychology,15 may not accurately reflect actual performance, as was the goal of the present work. However, under certain circumstances, self-perceived pre-game wellness (including self-reported sleep quality) may be predictive of objective in-game performance.65 More research will be needed to assess the validity of playerreported performance and objective performance, especially when athletes exhibit compromised sleep. Several experimental studies are particularly illustrative of the various trends in the results we have just outlined. To address the question of whether one night of sleep extension would be sufficient to improve various fitness indices among semi-professional soccer players, Fullagar et al15 tested a sleep hygiene intervention. The investigators implemented a sleep hygiene strategy (SHS) designed to maximize sleep duration and limit stimulation before bedtime to test whether this would be sufficient to improve either anaerobic (jumping height and force production) or aerobic endurance (Yo–Yo intermittent recovery level 2, YYIR2) performance after latenight soccer matches. Implementing a randomized design, they assigned 20 participants to follow either their normal post-match sleep routine [non-SHS (NSHS)] or a SHS involving early dimming of lights and lights out by midnight, cool room temperature, and no technology or light stimulation for 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. Actigraphy was used to measure sleep patterns, and sleep diary was used for subjective recall of sleep quality. Despite finding that those assigned to the SHS indeed exhibited increased sleep duration after the night match relative to those in the NSHS group, the investigators failed to identify any improvements in countermovement jump height, countermovement jump force production, or YYIR2 performance, tested over the following 2 days. On the other hand, as we have discussed, studies of acute sleep deprivation, especially those measuring technical performance outcomes, tended to yield positive results. Given that sleep is often disrupted the night before athletic competition,66 athletes involved in sports requiring these types of skills are likely to be particularly sensitive to sleep manipulations and thus should be counseled regarding the importance of sleep for game performance. Relatedly, chronic sleep extension studies have demonstrated significant benefits to athletes.35,49 Thus, strategies to improve sleep not only the night before an important sports event but also in the weeks leading up to this event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance. In this review, we have summarized and synthesized recent findings in the realm of sports and sleep science. One of the challenges of conducting such a literature review is that the study methodologies vary a great deal, as do the individual sports, making comparisons of effects and magnitudes of effect sizes across studies difficult. Additionally, unlike many studies of athletic performance and sleep conducted in nonathletes and recreational sports players, studies incorporating high-level competitors are limited, especially those implementing experimental approaches. Even among the best-controlled studies, sample sizes are small and sleep measurements vary considerably, with some studies measuring sleep duration objectively through polysomnography or actigraphy and others relying on self-report. All of these factors limit the scope of the conclusions that can be drawn. Nevertheless, they do provide valuable information about when sleep does or particularly when sleep does not seem to play a key role in influencing performance. Future research may seek to use larger sample sizes and standardize tests of athletic performance in order to identify optimal sleep standards, in addition to standardizing sleep metrics and incorporating more objective sleep data. In particular, here we focused on studies investigating sleep duration, although sleep timing is likely to be a relevant factor as well. As sleep onset and wake time have previously been shown to influence performance and recovery,5 future studies should aim to incorporate this information. Given these suggestions for improving future research, there are many opportunities for innovative research on this topic. One area in particular may be about how generalizable these findings are to other sports. Given the wide range of methodologies and used in these studies, another research goal would be to harmonize measures across studies and conduct a meta-analysis. Another area to investigate is trade-offs between wake time activities (eg, athletic practice) and sleep. For example, is it beneficial for swimmers to practice early in the morning even at the expense of their sleep? Research also should seek to investigate the mechanisms by which aerobic, tactical, and technical performance attributes may be preferentially sensitive to changes in sleep patterns. One limitation of the present work is that although the number of hours and/or nights of sleep interventions across studies varied, sleep duration was only measured the night before performance assessment. Thus, in order to obtain a more complete picture of sleep quantity and quality, future research should aim to measure sleep across the entire study period. Another limitation is that few of the studies examined explicitly the relationship between subjective sleep quality and performance, especially using validated sleep quality questionnaires such as the PSQI and ESS. Thus, this remains an open question that will be important to be investigated in the future. Once all these data are gathered, feasible and effective interventions should be developed, implemented, and evaluated to improve the sleep health and optimal performance of athletes. In conclusion, the importance of sleep for professional athletes to achieve high performance varies by the cognitive and physical demands of the sport. However, because most sports require integration of aerobic fitness, tactical skills, and technical skills, competitive athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration.  \\n   \n",

                   Hey, did you know that a systematic literature review found that there is no negative association between sleep duration and athletic performance? In fact, increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. The review also found that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. The studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Interestingly, although most acute sleep interventions involved sleep deprivation and yielded positive results, there were inconsistent results among the 2 acute sleep extension studies. This suggests that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance.   \n",

association between sleep duration and athletic performance? In fact, increased sleep duration had a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. It seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity. For performance outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills, most studies found benefits of sleep on performance. Additionally, studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. However, more research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. Overall, it seems that competitive athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration.   \n",

and athletic performance? In fact, increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. They also found that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. And, of the studies that measured outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills, most find benefits of sleep on performance. Finally, the studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely.   \n",

that a systematic literature review found that none of the published studies reviewed found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome for competitive athletes? In fact, all of the results reviewed showed that increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Also, it seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity. The studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Lastly, studies that measured outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills found benefits of sleep on performance. Tennis serving accuracy and basketball shooting were both improved by long-term sleep extension interventions, and tennis serving accuracy suffered when players were deprived of 2 to 2.5 hours of sleep at the beginning of the preceding night.   \n",

       "text           The Impact of Sleep Duration on Performance Among Competitive Athletes: A Systematic Literature Review\\n\\nDISCUSSION \\nThis literature review, although diverse in the range of sports, methods, and outcomes studied, provides several stylized facts that can inform sleep research and competitive athletes. First, out of all the published studies we reviewed, none found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome. All of the results reviewed showed that either the increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Note that among studies reporting significant positive results, effect sizes varied considerably (Tables 2-4), likely due to differences in the duration of sleep deprivation/extension experienced as well as differences in outcome measures. Second, when considering the aerobic and anaerobic characteristics of sports, it seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. For instance, Mejri et al40 found that depriving competitive taekwondo boxers of a mere 3 to 4 hours of sleep significantly impaired performance on the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test. By contrast, Blumert et al33 employed a relatively severe sleep deprivation protocol by depriving 9 national-caliber collegiate weightlifters of 24 hours of sleep and yet failed to identify adverse effects on any of the various weightlifting exercises examined. Relatedly, for both endurance and explosive, power-based exercises, it has been well documented that sleep deprivation is associated with increased perceived effort.56–58 Still, the relationship between perceived effort and objective performance has not been widely validated and is a topic for future investigation. Third, of the studies that measured outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills, most find benefits of sleep on performance. Tennis serving accuracy and basketball shooting were both improved by long-term sleep extension interventions,35,39 and tennis serving accuracy suffered when players were deprived of 2 to 2.5 hours of sleep at the beginning of the preceding night.37 Regarding studies conducted in players of team sports that incorporated tactics and decision-based outcomes to a broader extent, soccer as well as rugby players exhibited performance deficits after nights of decreased sleep duration.34 These results are in line with other literature demonstrating clear neurocognitive deficits in the setting of inadequate sleep in the general population, reviewed thoroughly elsewhere.59,60 Finally, when looking at the methodologies of the experimental studies, we found that the studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Interestingly although most acute sleep interventions involved sleep deprivation and yielded positive results, there were inconsistent results among the 2 acute sleep extension studies.15,38 Conversely, the majority of longer-term sleep intervention studies involved sleep extension and showed positive results.35,39,49 Taken together, these findings suggest that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. On the other hand, more research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. The reliability and precision of the various measurements may present challenges in interpretation of these studies. For example, “maximal” voluntary muscle contraction and voluntarily chosen training load are variable across subjects.61,62 On the other hand, “running economy,” the oxygen cost associated with a given running velocity, has low variability among highly trained runners and is significantly correlated with cardiorespiratory parameters used to assess aerobic capacity.63 A meta-analysis of the reliability of various measures of muscle power previously identified that field running tests tended to be more reliable than treadmill running tests, tests lasting up to 1 minute tended to be more reliable than those lasting greater than 1 minute (likely due to increased variability in muscle movement and limb positioning), and isokinetic tests tended to be more reliable when measuring muscle extension versus flexion.62 Somewhat reassuringly in the context of the present review, this metaanalysis also found that measurements taken from athletes were more reliable than those taken from non-athlete subjects. With respect to the validity of outcome measures reported as performance indicators, the nature of the sport (eg, team vs individual) may be an important determinant of whether what is measured in the laboratory translates to the actual game. For instance, for team-based sports requiring complex game structure such as soccer, measures of muscle force production or running speed are likely insufficient to provide an accurate assessment of in-game performance, although they may be helpful in making gross approximations and predictions.64 Of course, actual performance metrics from real or simulated games would be the ideal outcomes to quantify for such sports in future investigations. More specifically, for performance outcomes included in the current review, the following have been independently validated and shown to be reliable measures of athletic performance: Yo-Yo intermittent recovery (YYIR) test, isometric muscle contraction, squat, countermovement jump, free sthrow basketball shooting, tennis serving, shuttle-running tests, and Wingate test.42–48 In Table 1, we have indicated studies employing previously validated and reliable metrics of objective performance with asterisks (as per the criteria discussed above). Still, more work will be required to further validate the various performance outcomes measured in the studies reviewed in the present work, especially those involving complex, team-based measures such as composite game performance scores and passing accuracy. Likewise, given the high inter-individual variability of sleep variables used across the included studies, these metrics will also require further investigation to determine their precision and reliability as predictors of athletic performance. Importantly, we chose to require at least one objective performance measure among our inclusion criteria. The previous work relying on self-perceived performance, although informative in understanding the potential effect of sleep loss or gain on sports psychology,15 may not accurately reflect actual performance, as was the goal of the present work. However, under certain circumstances, self-perceived pre-game wellness (including self-reported sleep quality) may be predictive of objective in-game performance.65 More research will be needed to assess the validity of playerreported performance and objective performance, especially when athletes exhibit compromised sleep. Several experimental studies are particularly illustrative of the various trends in the results we have just outlined. To address the question of whether one night of sleep extension would be sufficient to improve various fitness indices among semi-professional soccer players, Fullagar et al15 tested a sleep hygiene intervention. The investigators implemented a sleep hygiene strategy (SHS) designed to maximize sleep duration and limit stimulation before bedtime to test whether this would be sufficient to improve either anaerobic (jumping height and force production) or aerobic endurance (Yo–Yo intermittent recovery level 2, YYIR2) performance after latenight soccer matches. Implementing a randomized design, they assigned 20 participants to follow either their normal post-match sleep routine [non-SHS (NSHS)] or a SHS involving early dimming of lights and lights out by midnight, cool room temperature, and no technology or light stimulation for 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. Actigraphy was used to measure sleep patterns, and sleep diary was used for subjective recall of sleep quality. Despite finding that those assigned to the SHS indeed exhibited increased sleep duration after the night match relative to those in the NSHS group, the investigators failed to identify any improvements in countermovement jump height, countermovement jump force production, or YYIR2 performance, tested over the following 2 days. On the other hand, as we have discussed, studies of acute sleep deprivation, especially those measuring technical performance outcomes, tended to yield positive results. Given that sleep is often disrupted the night before athletic competition,66 athletes involved in sports requiring these types of skills are likely to be particularly sensitive to sleep manipulations and thus should be counseled regarding the importance of sleep for game performance. Relatedly, chronic sleep extension studies have demonstrated significant benefits to athletes.35,49 Thus, strategies to improve sleep not only the night before an important sports event but also in the weeks leading up to this event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance. In this review, we have summarized and synthesized recent findings in the realm of sports and sleep science. One of the challenges of conducting such a literature review is that the study methodologies vary a great deal, as do the individual sports, making comparisons of effects and magnitudes of effect sizes across studies difficult. Additionally, unlike many studies of athletic performance and sleep conducted in nonathletes and recreational sports players, studies incorporating high-level competitors are limited, especially those implementing experimental approaches. Even among the best-controlled studies, sample sizes are small and sleep measurements vary considerably, with some studies measuring sleep duration objectively through polysomnography or actigraphy and others relying on self-report. All of these factors limit the scope of the conclusions that can be drawn. Nevertheless, they do provide valuable information about when sleep does or particularly when sleep does not seem to play a key role in influencing performance. Future research may seek to use larger sample sizes and standardize tests of athletic performance in order to identify optimal sleep standards, in addition to standardizing sleep metrics and incorporating more objective sleep data. In particular, here we focused on studies investigating sleep duration, although sleep timing is likely to be a relevant factor as well. As sleep onset and wake time have previously been shown to influence performance and recovery,5 future studies should aim to incorporate this information. Given these suggestions for improving future research, there are many opportunities for innovative research on this topic. One area in particular may be about how generalizable these findings are to other sports. Given the wide range of methodologies and used in these studies, another research goal would be to harmonize measures across studies and conduct a meta-analysis. Another area to investigate is trade-offs between wake time activities (eg, athletic practice) and sleep. For example, is it beneficial for swimmers to practice early in the morning even at the expense of their sleep? Research also should seek to investigate the mechanisms by which aerobic, tactical, and technical performance attributes may be preferentially sensitive to changes in sleep patterns. One limitation of the present work is that although the number of hours and/or nights of sleep interventions across studies varied, sleep duration was only measured the night before performance assessment. Thus, in order to obtain a more complete picture of sleep quantity and quality, future research should aim to measure sleep across the entire study period. Another limitation is that few of the studies examined explicitly the relationship between subjective sleep quality and performance, especially using validated sleep quality questionnaires such as the PSQI and ESS. Thus, this remains an open question that will be important to be investigated in the future. Once all these data are gathered, feasible and effective interventions should be developed, implemented, and evaluated to improve the sleep health and optimal performance of athletes. In conclusion, the importance of sleep for professional athletes to achieve high performance varies by the cognitive and physical demands of the sport. However, because most sports require integration of aerobic fitness, tactical skills, and technical skills, competitive athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration.  \\n   \n",

stress on highly palatable food intake and craving. Results show that exposure to both food cues and stress leads to increased HP food craving and subsequent snacking. Ghrelin and cortisol levels were found to impact food motivation differently in lean and overweight individuals. The study highlights the need for further investigation into the biobehavioral processes underlying food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations. #foodcraving #stress #ghrelin #cortisol #obesity #healthresearch   \n",

healthy community adults has found that exposure to food cues and stressors increases highly palatable (HP) food craving and subsequent snacking of HP foods. The study also found differential effects by body mass index (BMI) group, with stress-induced HP food craving predicting subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group. Furthermore, the findings suggest weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions. Overall, the study sheds light on the biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations. #foodcravings #obesity #healthresearch   \n",

                                                                 A recent study found that exposure to both food cues and stress increased highly palatable food (HP food) craving and subsequent snacking of HP foods. The study also found differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups, with stress-induced HP food craving predicting subsequent intake only in the overweight group. Ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across BMI groups. The study suggests a need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations. #foodcravings #stress #HPfood #obesity #BMI #nutrition   \n",

experiment, exposure to both personal food cues and stressors resulted in increases in highly palatable food craving and subsequent snacking. Lean and overweight individuals showed differential effects in response to stress and food cue exposure. Ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation, with weight-related adaptations in ghrelin potentially shifting food motivation towards hedonic regulation under stress conditions. The study highlights the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying highly palatable food motivation and intake in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations. #foodcraving #stress #ghrelin #cortisol #obesity #biobehavioralprocesses #sciencecommunication   \n",

       "text           Food craving, cortisol and ghrelin responses in modeling highly palatable snack intake in the laboratory\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nThis preliminary study is the first to directly compare the effects of both food cue and stress exposure on HP food craving and HP food intake in a 3-day human laboratory experiment conducted within a controlled hospital-based setting with healthy community adults. As both the ubiquitous HP food environment and stressors are known to increase HP food intake and obesity risk, a direct comparison of these contexts could identify similar and differential processes that may underlie food motivation and intake. As hypothesized, and similar to our previous work in addiction [18], we found that exposure to both personal food cues and to personal stressors relative to a neutral relaxing control cue resulted in increases in HP food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods in a standardized Food Snack Test (FST), but with differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups. Furthermore, we found that increased food craving in these contexts was highly associated with subsequent amounts of HP food snack intake. Finally, both ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. Together, these results support the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.\\nExposure to food cue imagery led to significant increases in HP food craving prior to the presentation of the FST at the pre-snack timepoint in both lean and OW individuals. Moreover, food cue-related increases in food craving predicted significant increases in HP snack intake across both lean and OW individuals. These data are consistent with a significant literature indicating that rewarding stimuli and their related contexts increase motivation and wanting of rewarding stimuli via conditioning and/or incentive salience mechanisms [4, 20, 42]. Also, a number of basic science and human neuroimaging studies have shown that food cue stimulus exposure increases food craving and activate brain reward and motivation regions [4, 7-11, 18, 43, 44]. Current findings further indicate that such food cue-related increases in HP food craving promote HP snack intake with greater intake of HP foods in the food cue context relative to the neutral relaxing contexts across individuals. These data validate the real-world contexts of advertising of HP foods to promote greater sales and intake of HP foods.\\nIn contrast, we found a differential impact of stress on HP food craving and intake by BMI group where stress significantly increased food craving relative to the neutral condition, but only in the overweight and not the lean group. Furthermore, stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group, suggesting that food motivational processes may be relevant in identifying those who are vulnerable to stress-induced eating. Previous laboratory studies have shown mixed results with some showing stress increasing food intake [17, 24], but others reporting no consistent increases in intake [23, 45]. While the methodology has varied across these studies, current findings suggest the need for direct comparison of BMI groups and consideration of weight-related adaptations in assessing stress effects on HP food motivation and intake. Current findings are also supported by a growing literature suggesting that BMI-related alterations impact not only metabolic hormones but also stress and reward processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake [18, 20, 44]. Together our findings on food cue- and stress- related effects on HP food motivation and intake suggests differential effects by BMI, that may in turn, point to different mechanisms that may drive weight gain and obesity risk in individuals who are lean versus those who are overweight.\\nOur findings also show differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin responses and their contribution to HP food motivation and intake. Stress and food cue exposure increased ghrelin responses, but significantly for the OW and not the LN group. Furthermore, only in the OW group was stress-induced ghrelin increases significantly associated with both HP food craving and subsequent HP food intake. While ghrelin has well known homeostatic effects on feeding function [46, 47], recent focus has been on its role in both stress and mood regulation as well as in hedonically motivated feeding behavior, partially via its effects on mesolimbic reward circuits [37, 48]. Findings indicate that ghrelin can shift preferences to high palatable foods and increase the motivational aspects of food reward [48]. Ghrelin is also known to increase with stress and is involved in regulating anxiety and mood (36, 49-51). Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that ghrelin administration increases the neural response to food pictures in areas associated with hedonic eating (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and ventral tegmental area) [52]. Additionally, there is growing evidence that feed-forward circuitry between stress and food reward maybe partly mediated by ghrelin [52, 53]. In the current study, as the effects were specific to the OW group, they suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions.\\nFinally, our findings also showed differential effects of cortisol responses to stress and food cue exposure. Notably, there was a significant increase in cortisol in the food cue relative to the neutral condition that was due to significant increases in cortisol in the lean group and not so in the OW group. Furthermore, food cue-related increases in cortisol was associated with greater food cue-related HP craving, suggesting a role for cortisol in food motivation. While glucocorticoids are often associated with the stress response, they are also known to play an important role in energy intake and regulation. Cortisol increases have been noted with intake of specific macronutrients, including carbohydrates, fats and proteins in animals and humans [6, 54], with the source of cortisol increases to be via both adrenal and extra-adrenal production [54]. Furthermore, in our previous neuroimaging study, increases in cortisol during a mild hypoglycemic state was associated with greater activation of brain reward regions that promoted greater food craving [44]. Together, this previous research supports current findings of the association between greater cortisol responses to food cue exposure with food cue-induced HP food craving.\\nWe did not see an overall significant increase in cortisol during stress exposure, but this was largely due to a lack of response in the OW group. Remarkably, the OW group showed blunted cortisol responses during stress and food cue relative to neutral conditions. This finding is consistent with growing evidence of blunted cortisol and autonomic responses to stress challenge in people who are OW or obese, along with altered autonomic and peripheral catecholamine responses to stress challenge in those weight groups [18, 21-25, 55]. HPA axis adaptations with low cortisol awakening responses have been reported in higher BMI groups, along with blunted responses to stress and reduced dopamine activity [20, 56]. Thus, the current findings of lack of cortisol increases in the OW group leads one to speculate that such HPA axis adaptations may contribute to higher HP food craving and intake in food cue and in stress contexts. However, this is speculation and would need further testing in future studies.\\nSeveral limitations of the current study need to be considered. First, the sample size was small and thus the findings are preliminary and need further validation. Also, due to the small sample size, sex differences and differential responses within the overweight groups were not assessed. It is possible that men and women differ in their food motivation and intake responses in food cue and stress contexts as shown in previous work [26,27]. Also, continuous assessment of BMI rather than arbitrary cutoffs for individuals in the lean, overweight and obese BMI range may provide greater sensitivity in assessing weight related adaptations. Thus, research with larger samples is required to replicate current findings and address these issues. Finally, as this study was conducted while participants were in a hospital, it is not clear whether the findings are generalizable to an outpatient experimental context or to real world food motivation and intake settings. On the other hand, as food cues and stress are among the most common contexts in which overeating of HP foods occur in the real world, the current study presents a well-controlled experimental model to study the biobehavioral processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake of highly palatable foods. Evidence of HP food motivation and increased snacking in these contexts is consistent with reports of obesogenic environments promoting increased HP food intake and weight gain in the real world. Furthermore, positive associations of HP food craving and intake by total ghrelin and cortisol responses suggests a role for metabolic and neuroendocrine adaptations in increased HP food motivation and intake.\\n   \n",

          Hey, did you know that a recent study found that exposure to both personal food cues and personal stressors increases highly palatable (HP) food craving and subsequent snacking of HP foods? The study also found that ghrelin and cortisol significantly impact food motivation, but differently across lean and overweight individuals. In fact, stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight group, suggesting that food motivational processes may be relevant in identifying those who are vulnerable to stress-induced eating. Also, the study found that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions. Overall, the study presents a well-controlled experimental model to study the biobehavioral processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake of highly palatable foods.  \n",

exposure to both personal food cues and personal stressors can increase highly palatable (HP) food craving and subsequent snacking of HP foods? The study was conducted with healthy community adults and found that the effects of food cue and stress exposure on HP food craving and intake differed between lean and overweight BMI groups. The study also found that both ghrelin and cortisol impact food motivation differently across these groups. Interestingly, increased ghrelin responses were found to be associated with HP food craving and intake only in the overweight group, suggesting that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions. Overall, the study suggests that biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake need further investigation, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.  \n",

I just read about a study that compared the effects of food cue and stress exposure on highly palatable (HP) food craving and intake. They found that exposure to both food cues and stress resulted in increases in HP food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods. Interestingly, they also found differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups. Stress significantly increased food craving relative to the neutral condition, but only in the overweight and not the lean group. Furthermore, stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group. They also found that both ghrelin and cortisol significantly impacted food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. The findings suggest the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.  \n",

                                               Hey, did you hear about the recent study on food craving, cortisol and ghrelin responses? The study found that exposure to both personal food cues and stressors resulted in increases in highly palatable (HP) food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods. This was validated by real-world contexts of advertising of HP foods to promote greater sales and intake of HP foods. Interestingly, the study also found differential effects of stress on HP food craving and intake by BMI group where stress significantly increased food craving, but only in the overweight and not the lean group. Furthermore, the study showed differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin responses and their contribution to HP food motivation and intake. In addition, the study found that cortisol responses to food cue exposure were associated with greater food cue-induced HP food craving. Overall, these findings suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions.  \n",

setting found that exposure to both food cues and stress led to increased craving and subsequent snacking of highly palatable foods? The study also found that the effects of food cue and stress exposure on food motivation and intake differed between lean and overweight individuals, with stress significantly increasing food craving and subsequent intake only in the overweight group. The study also revealed that ghrelin and cortisol responses significantly impacted food motivation, with ghrelin associated with hedonic regulation of food reward and cortisol associated with food cue-induced craving. Interestingly, the study found that overweight individuals had blunted cortisol responses to stress and food cues, potentially contributing to increased craving and intake of highly palatable foods. Overall, the findings suggest the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying highly palatable food motivation and intake.  \n",

As both the ubiquitous HP food environment and stressors are known to increase HP food intake and obesity risk, a direct comparison of these contexts could identify similar and differential processes that may underlie food motivation and intake. As hypothesized, and similar to our previous work in addiction [18], we found that exposure to both personal food cues and to personal stressors relative to a neutral relaxing control cue resulted in increases in HP food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods in a standardized Food Snack Test (FST), but with differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups. Furthermore, we found that increased food craving in these contexts was highly associated with subsequent amounts of HP food snack intake. Finally, both ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. Together, these results support the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.\\nExposure to food cue imagery led to significant increases in HP food craving prior to the presentation of the FST at the pre-snack timepoint in both lean and OW individuals. Moreover, food cue-related increases in food craving predicted significant increases in HP snack intake across both lean and OW individuals. These data are consistent with a significant literature indicating that rewarding stimuli and their related contexts increase motivation and wanting of rewarding stimuli via conditioning and/or incentive salience mechanisms [4, 20, 42]. Also, a number of basic science and human neuroimaging studies have shown that food cue stimulus exposure increases food craving and activate brain reward and motivation regions [4, 7-11, 18, 43, 44]. Current findings further indicate that such food cue-related increases in HP food craving promote HP snack intake with greater intake of HP foods in the food cue context relative to the neutral relaxing contexts across individuals. These data validate the real-world contexts of advertising of HP foods to promote greater sales and intake of HP foods.\\nIn contrast, we found a differential impact of stress on HP food craving and intake by BMI group where stress significantly increased food craving relative to the neutral condition, but only in the overweight and not the lean group. Furthermore, stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group, suggesting that food motivational processes may be relevant in identifying those who are vulnerable to stress-induced eating. Previous laboratory studies have shown mixed results with some showing stress increasing food intake [17, 24], but others reporting no consistent increases in intake [23, 45]. While the methodology has varied across these studies, current findings suggest the need for direct comparison of BMI groups and consideration of weight-related adaptations in assessing stress effects on HP food motivation and intake. Current findings are also supported by a growing literature suggesting that BMI-related alterations impact not only metabolic hormones but also stress and reward processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake [18, 20, 44]. Together our findings on food cue- and stress- related effects on HP food motivation and intake suggests differential effects by BMI, that may in turn, point to different mechanisms that may drive weight gain and obesity risk in individuals who are lean versus those who are overweight.\\nOur findings also show differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin responses and their contribution to HP food motivation and intake. Stress and food cue exposure increased ghrelin responses, but significantly for the OW and not the LN group. Furthermore, only in the OW group was stress-induced ghrelin increases significantly associated with both HP food craving and subsequent HP food intake. While ghrelin has well known homeostatic effects on feeding function [46, 47], recent focus has been on its role in both stress and mood regulation as well as in hedonically motivated feeding behavior, partially via its effects on mesolimbic reward circuits [37, 48]. Findings indicate that ghrelin can shift preferences to high palatable foods and increase the motivational aspects of food reward [48]. Ghrelin is also known to increase with stress and is involved in regulating anxiety and mood (36, 49-51). Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that ghrelin administration increases the neural response to food pictures in areas associated with hedonic eating (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and ventral tegmental area) [52]. Additionally, there is growing evidence that feed-forward circuitry between stress and food reward maybe partly mediated by ghrelin [52, 53]. In the current study, as the effects were specific to the OW group, they suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions.\\nFinally, our findings also showed differential effects of cortisol responses to stress and food cue exposure. Notably, there was a significant increase in cortisol in the food cue relative to the neutral condition that was due to significant increases in cortisol in the lean group and not so in the OW group. Furthermore, food cue-related increases in cortisol was associated with greater food cue-related HP craving, suggesting a role for cortisol in food motivation. While glucocorticoids are often associated with the stress response, they are also known to play an important role in energy intake and regulation. Cortisol increases have been noted with intake of specific macronutrients, including carbohydrates, fats and proteins in animals and humans [6, 54], with the source of cortisol increases to be via both adrenal and extra-adrenal production [54]. Furthermore, in our previous neuroimaging study, increases in cortisol during a mild hypoglycemic state was associated with greater activation of brain reward regions that promoted greater food craving [44]. Together, this previous research supports current findings of the association between greater cortisol responses to food cue exposure with food cue-induced HP food craving.\\nWe did not see an overall significant increase in cortisol during stress exposure, but this was largely due to a lack of response in the OW group. Remarkably, the OW group showed blunted cortisol responses during stress and food cue relative to neutral conditions. This finding is consistent with growing evidence of blunted cortisol and autonomic responses to stress challenge in people who are OW or obese, along with altered autonomic and peripheral catecholamine responses to stress challenge in those weight groups [18, 21-25, 55]. HPA axis adaptations with low cortisol awakening responses have been reported in higher BMI groups, along with blunted responses to stress and reduced dopamine activity [20, 56]. Thus, the current findings of lack of cortisol increases in the OW group leads one to speculate that such HPA axis adaptations may contribute to higher HP food craving and intake in food cue and in stress contexts. However, this is speculation and would need further testing in future studies.\\nSeveral limitations of the current study need to be considered. First, the sample size was small and thus the findings are preliminary and need further validation. Also, due to the small sample size, sex differences and differential responses within the overweight groups were not assessed. It is possible that men and women differ in their food motivation and intake responses in food cue and stress contexts as shown in previous work [26,27]. Also, continuous assessment of BMI rather than arbitrary cutoffs for individuals in the lean, overweight and obese BMI range may provide greater sensitivity in assessing weight related adaptations. Thus, research with larger samples is required to replicate current findings and address these issues. Finally, as this study was conducted while participants were in a hospital, it is not clear whether the findings are generalizable to an outpatient experimental context or to real world food motivation and intake settings. On the other hand, as food cues and stress are among the most common contexts in which overeating of HP foods occur in the real world, the current study presents a well-controlled experimental model to study the biobehavioral processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake of highly palatable foods. Evidence of HP food motivation and increased snacking in these contexts is consistent with reports of obesogenic environments promoting increased HP food intake and weight gain in the real world. Furthermore, positive associations of HP food craving and intake by total ghrelin and cortisol responses suggests a role for metabolic and neuroendocrine adaptations in increased HP food motivation and intake.\\n  \n",

The studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Interestingly, although most acute sleep interventions involved sleep deprivation and yielded positive results, there were inconsistent results among the 2 acute sleep extension studies.

       "      <td>The Impact of Sleep Duration on Performance Among Competitive Athletes: A Systematic Literature Review\\n\\nDISCUSSION \\nThis literature review, although diverse in the range of sports, methods, and outcomes studied, provides several stylized facts that can inform sleep research and competitive athletes. First, out of all the published studies we reviewed, none found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome. All of the results reviewed showed that either the increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Note that among studies reporting significant positive results, effect sizes varied considerably (Tables 2-4), likely due to differences in the duration of sleep deprivation/extension experienced as well as differences in outcome measures. Second, when considering the aerobic and anaerobic characteristics of sports, it seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. For instance, Mejri et al40 found that depriving competitive taekwondo boxers of a mere 3 to 4 hours of sleep significantly impaired performance on the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test. By contrast, Blumert et al33 employed a relatively severe sleep deprivation protocol by depriving 9 national-caliber collegiate weightlifters of 24 hours of sleep and yet failed to identify adverse effects on any of the various weightlifting exercises examined. Relatedly, for both endurance and explosive, power-based exercises, it has been well documented that sleep deprivation is associated with increased perceived effort.56–58 Still, the relationship between perceived effort and objective performance has not been widely validated and is a topic for future investigation. Third, of the studies that measured outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills, most find benefits of sleep on performance. Tennis serving accuracy and basketball shooting were both improved by long-term sleep extension interventions,35,39 and tennis serving accuracy suffered when players were deprived of 2 to 2.5 hours of sleep at the beginning of the preceding night.37 Regarding studies conducted in players of team sports that incorporated tactics and decision-based outcomes to a broader extent, soccer as well as rugby players exhibited performance deficits after nights of decreased sleep duration.34 These results are in line with other literature demonstrating clear neurocognitive deficits in the setting of inadequate sleep in the general population, reviewed thoroughly elsewhere.59,60 Finally, when looking at the methodologies of the experimental studies, we found that the studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Interestingly although most acute sleep interventions involved sleep deprivation and yielded positive results, there were inconsistent results among the 2 acute sleep extension studies.15,38 Conversely, the majority of longer-term sleep intervention studies involved sleep extension and showed positive results.35,39,49 Taken together, these findings suggest that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. On the other hand, more research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. The reliability and precision of the various measurements may present challenges in interpretation of these studies. For example, “maximal” voluntary muscle contraction and voluntarily chosen training load are variable across subjects.61,62 On the other hand, “running economy,” the oxygen cost associated with a given running velocity, has low variability among highly trained runners and is significantly correlated with cardiorespiratory parameters used to assess aerobic capacity.63 A meta-analysis of the reliability of various measures of muscle power previously identified that field running tests tended to be more reliable than treadmill running tests, tests lasting up to 1 minute tended to be more reliable than those lasting greater than 1 minute (likely due to increased variability in muscle movement and limb positioning), and isokinetic tests tended to be more reliable when measuring muscle extension versus flexion.62 Somewhat reassuringly in the context of the present review, this metaanalysis also found that measurements taken from athletes were more reliable than those taken from non-athlete subjects. With respect to the validity of outcome measures reported as performance indicators, the nature of the sport (eg, team vs individual) may be an important determinant of whether what is measured in the laboratory translates to the actual game. For instance, for team-based sports requiring complex game structure such as soccer, measures of muscle force production or running speed are likely insufficient to provide an accurate assessment of in-game performance, although they may be helpful in making gross approximations and predictions.64 Of course, actual performance metrics from real or simulated games would be the ideal outcomes to quantify for such sports in future investigations. More specifically, for performance outcomes included in the current review, the following have been independently validated and shown to be reliable measures of athletic performance: Yo-Yo intermittent recovery (YYIR) test, isometric muscle contraction, squat, countermovement jump, free sthrow basketball shooting, tennis serving, shuttle-running tests, and Wingate test.42–48 In Table 1, we have indicated studies employing previously validated and reliable metrics of objective performance with asterisks (as per the criteria discussed above). Still, more work will be required to further validate the various performance outcomes measured in the studies reviewed in the present work, especially those involving complex, team-based measures such as composite game performance scores and passing accuracy. Likewise, given the high inter-individual variability of sleep variables used across the included studies, these metrics will also require further investigation to determine their precision and reliability as predictors of athletic performance. Importantly, we chose to require at least one objective performance measure among our inclusion criteria. The previous work relying on self-perceived performance, although informative in understanding the potential effect of sleep loss or gain on sports psychology,15 may not accurately reflect actual performance, as was the goal of the present work. However, under certain circumstances, self-perceived pre-game wellness (including self-reported sleep quality) may be predictive of objective in-game performance.65 More research will be needed to assess the validity of playerreported performance and objective performance, especially when athletes exhibit compromised sleep. Several experimental studies are particularly illustrative of the various trends in the results we have just outlined. To address the question of whether one night of sleep extension would be sufficient to improve various fitness indices among semi-professional soccer players, Fullagar et al15 tested a sleep hygiene intervention. The investigators implemented a sleep hygiene strategy (SHS) designed to maximize sleep duration and limit stimulation before bedtime to test whether this would be sufficient to improve either anaerobic (jumping height and force production) or aerobic endurance (Yo–Yo intermittent recovery level 2, YYIR2) performance after latenight soccer matches. Implementing a randomized design, they assigned 20 participants to follow either their normal post-match sleep routine [non-SHS (NSHS)] or a SHS involving early dimming of lights and lights out by midnight, cool room temperature, and no technology or light stimulation for 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. Actigraphy was used to measure sleep patterns, and sleep diary was used for subjective recall of sleep quality. Despite finding that those assigned to the SHS indeed exhibited increased sleep duration after the night match relative to those in the NSHS group, the investigators failed to identify any improvements in countermovement jump height, countermovement jump force production, or YYIR2 performance, tested over the following 2 days. On the other hand, as we have discussed, studies of acute sleep deprivation, especially those measuring technical performance outcomes, tended to yield positive results. Given that sleep is often disrupted the night before athletic competition,66 athletes involved in sports requiring these types of skills are likely to be particularly sensitive to sleep manipulations and thus should be counseled regarding the importance of sleep for game performance. Relatedly, chronic sleep extension studies have demonstrated significant benefits to athletes.35,49 Thus, strategies to improve sleep not only the night before an important sports event but also in the weeks leading up to this event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance. In this review, we have summarized and synthesized recent findings in the realm of sports and sleep science. One of the challenges of conducting such a literature review is that the study methodologies vary a great deal, as do the individual sports, making comparisons of effects and magnitudes of effect sizes across studies difficult. Additionally, unlike many studies of athletic performance and sleep conducted in nonathletes and recreational sports players, studies incorporating high-level competitors are limited, especially those implementing experimental approaches. Even among the best-controlled studies, sample sizes are small and sleep measurements vary considerably, with some studies measuring sleep duration objectively through polysomnography or actigraphy and others relying on self-report. All of these factors limit the scope of the conclusions that can be drawn. Nevertheless, they do provide valuable information about when sleep does or particularly when sleep does not seem to play a key role in influencing performance. Future research may seek to use larger sample sizes and standardize tests of athletic performance in order to identify optimal sleep standards, in addition to standardizing sleep metrics and incorporating more objective sleep data. In particular, here we focused on studies investigating sleep duration, although sleep timing is likely to be a relevant factor as well. As sleep onset and wake time have previously been shown to influence performance and recovery,5 future studies should aim to incorporate this information. Given these suggestions for improving future research, there are many opportunities for innovative research on this topic. One area in particular may be about how generalizable these findings are to other sports. Given the wide range of methodologies and used in these studies, another research goal would be to harmonize measures across studies and conduct a meta-analysis. Another area to investigate is trade-offs between wake time activities (eg, athletic practice) and sleep. For example, is it beneficial for swimmers to practice early in the morning even at the expense of their sleep? Research also should seek to investigate the mechanisms by which aerobic, tactical, and technical performance attributes may be preferentially sensitive to changes in sleep patterns. One limitation of the present work is that although the number of hours and/or nights of sleep interventions across studies varied, sleep duration was only measured the night before performance assessment. Thus, in order to obtain a more complete picture of sleep quantity and quality, future research should aim to measure sleep across the entire study period. Another limitation is that few of the studies examined explicitly the relationship between subjective sleep quality and performance, especially using validated sleep quality questionnaires such as the PSQI and ESS. Thus, this remains an open question that will be important to be investigated in the future. Once all these data are gathered, feasible and effective interventions should be developed, implemented, and evaluated to improve the sleep health and optimal performance of athletes. In conclusion, the importance of sleep for professional athletes to achieve high performance varies by the cognitive and physical demands of the sport. However, because most sports require integration of aerobic fitness, tactical skills, and technical skills, competitive athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration.  \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Food craving, cortisol and ghrelin responses in modeling highly palatable snack intake in the laboratory\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nThis preliminary study is the first to directly compare the effects of both food cue and stress exposure on HP food craving and HP food intake in a 3-day human laboratory experiment conducted within a controlled hospital-based setting with healthy community adults. As both the ubiquitous HP food environment and stressors are known to increase HP food intake and obesity risk, a direct comparison of these contexts could identify similar and differential processes that may underlie food motivation and intake. As hypothesized, and similar to our previous work in addiction [18], we found that exposure to both personal food cues and to personal stressors relative to a neutral relaxing control cue resulted in increases in HP food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods in a standardized Food Snack Test (FST), but with differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups. Furthermore, we found that increased food craving in these contexts was highly associated with subsequent amounts of HP food snack intake. Finally, both ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. Together, these results support the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.\\nExposure to food cue imagery led to significant increases in HP food craving prior to the presentation of the FST at the pre-snack timepoint in both lean and OW individuals. Moreover, food cue-related increases in food craving predicted significant increases in HP snack intake across both lean and OW individuals. These data are consistent with a significant literature indicating that rewarding stimuli and their related contexts increase motivation and wanting of rewarding stimuli via conditioning and/or incentive salience mechanisms [4, 20, 42]. Also, a number of basic science and human neuroimaging studies have shown that food cue stimulus exposure increases food craving and activate brain reward and motivation regions [4, 7-11, 18, 43, 44]. Current findings further indicate that such food cue-related increases in HP food craving promote HP snack intake with greater intake of HP foods in the food cue context relative to the neutral relaxing contexts across individuals. These data validate the real-world contexts of advertising of HP foods to promote greater sales and intake of HP foods.\\nIn contrast, we found a differential impact of stress on HP food craving and intake by BMI group where stress significantly increased food craving relative to the neutral condition, but only in the overweight and not the lean group. Furthermore, stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group, suggesting that food motivational processes may be relevant in identifying those who are vulnerable to stress-induced eating. Previous laboratory studies have shown mixed results with some showing stress increasing food intake [17, 24], but others reporting no consistent increases in intake [23, 45]. While the methodology has varied across these studies, current findings suggest the need for direct comparison of BMI groups and consideration of weight-related adaptations in assessing stress effects on HP food motivation and intake. Current findings are also supported by a growing literature suggesting that BMI-related alterations impact not only metabolic hormones but also stress and reward processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake [18, 20, 44]. Together our findings on food cue- and stress- related effects on HP food motivation and intake suggests differential effects by BMI, that may in turn, point to different mechanisms that may drive weight gain and obesity risk in individuals who are lean versus those who are overweight.\\nOur findings also show differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin responses and their contribution to HP food motivation and intake. Stress and food cue exposure increased ghrelin responses, but significantly for the OW and not the LN group. Furthermore, only in the OW group was stress-induced ghrelin increases significantly associated with both HP food craving and subsequent HP food intake. While ghrelin has well known homeostatic effects on feeding function [46, 47], recent focus has been on its role in both stress and mood regulation as well as in hedonically motivated feeding behavior, partially via its effects on mesolimbic reward circuits [37, 48]. Findings indicate that ghrelin can shift preferences to high palatable foods and increase the motivational aspects of food reward [48]. Ghrelin is also known to increase with stress and is involved in regulating anxiety and mood (36, 49-51). Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that ghrelin administration increases the neural response to food pictures in areas associated with hedonic eating (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and ventral tegmental area) [52]. Additionally, there is growing evidence that feed-forward circuitry between stress and food reward maybe partly mediated by ghrelin [52, 53]. In the current study, as the effects were specific to the OW group, they suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions.\\nFinally, our findings also showed differential effects of cortisol responses to stress and food cue exposure. Notably, there was a significant increase in cortisol in the food cue relative to the neutral condition that was due to significant increases in cortisol in the lean group and not so in the OW group. Furthermore, food cue-related increases in cortisol was associated with greater food cue-related HP craving, suggesting a role for cortisol in food motivation. While glucocorticoids are often associated with the stress response, they are also known to play an important role in energy intake and regulation. Cortisol increases have been noted with intake of specific macronutrients, including carbohydrates, fats and proteins in animals and humans [6, 54], with the source of cortisol increases to be via both adrenal and extra-adrenal production [54]. Furthermore, in our previous neuroimaging study, increases in cortisol during a mild hypoglycemic state was associated with greater activation of brain reward regions that promoted greater food craving [44]. Together, this previous research supports current findings of the association between greater cortisol responses to food cue exposure with food cue-induced HP food craving.\\nWe did not see an overall significant increase in cortisol during stress exposure, but this was largely due to a lack of response in the OW group. Remarkably, the OW group showed blunted cortisol responses during stress and food cue relative to neutral conditions. This finding is consistent with growing evidence of blunted cortisol and autonomic responses to stress challenge in people who are OW or obese, along with altered autonomic and peripheral catecholamine responses to stress challenge in those weight groups [18, 21-25, 55]. HPA axis adaptations with low cortisol awakening responses have been reported in higher BMI groups, along with blunted responses to stress and reduced dopamine activity [20, 56]. Thus, the current findings of lack of cortisol increases in the OW group leads one to speculate that such HPA axis adaptations may contribute to higher HP food craving and intake in food cue and in stress contexts. However, this is speculation and would need further testing in future studies.\\nSeveral limitations of the current study need to be considered. First, the sample size was small and thus the findings are preliminary and need further validation. Also, due to the small sample size, sex differences and differential responses within the overweight groups were not assessed. It is possible that men and women differ in their food motivation and intake responses in food cue and stress contexts as shown in previous work [26,27]. Also, continuous assessment of BMI rather than arbitrary cutoffs for individuals in the lean, overweight and obese BMI range may provide greater sensitivity in assessing weight related adaptations. Thus, research with larger samples is required to replicate current findings and address these issues. Finally, as this study was conducted while participants were in a hospital, it is not clear whether the findings are generalizable to an outpatient experimental context or to real world food motivation and intake settings. On the other hand, as food cues and stress are among the most common contexts in which overeating of HP foods occur in the real world, the current study presents a well-controlled experimental model to study the biobehavioral processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake of highly palatable foods. Evidence of HP food motivation and increased snacking in these contexts is consistent with reports of obesogenic environments promoting increased HP food intake and weight gain in the real world.

As both the ubiquitous HP food environment and stressors are known to increase HP food intake and obesity risk, a direct comparison of these contexts could identify similar and differential processes that may underlie food motivation and intake. As hypothesized, and similar to our previous work in addiction [18], we found that exposure to both personal food cues and to personal stressors relative to a neutral relaxing control cue resulted in increases in HP food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods in a standardized Food Snack Test (FST), but with differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups. Furthermore, we found that increased food craving in these contexts was highly associated with subsequent amounts of HP food snack intake. Finally, both ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. Together, these results support the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.\\nExposure to food cue imagery led to significant increases in HP food craving prior to the presentation of the FST at the pre-snack timepoint in both lean and OW individuals. Moreover, food cue-related increases in food craving predicted significant increases in HP snack intake across both lean and OW individuals. These data are consistent with a significant literature indicating that rewarding stimuli and their related contexts increase motivation and wanting of rewarding stimuli via conditioning and/or incentive salience mechanisms [4, 20, 42]. Also, a number of basic science and human neuroimaging studies have shown that food cue stimulus exposure increases food craving and activate brain reward and motivation regions [4, 7-11, 18, 43, 44]. Current findings further indicate that such food cue-related increases in HP food craving promote HP snack intake with greater intake of HP foods in the food cue context relative to the neutral relaxing contexts across individuals. These data validate the real-world contexts of advertising of HP foods to promote greater sales and intake of HP foods.\\nIn contrast, we found a differential impact of stress on HP food craving and intake by BMI group where stress significantly increased food craving relative to the neutral condition, but only in the overweight and not the lean group. Furthermore, stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group, suggesting that food motivational processes may be relevant in identifying those who are vulnerable to stress-induced eating. Previous laboratory studies have shown mixed results with some showing stress increasing food intake [17, 24], but others reporting no consistent increases in intake [23, 45]. While the methodology has varied across these studies, current findings suggest the need for direct comparison of BMI groups and consideration of weight-related adaptations in assessing stress effects on HP food motivation and intake. Current findings are also supported by a growing literature suggesting that BMI-related alterations impact not only metabolic hormones but also stress and reward processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake [18, 20, 44]. Together our findings on food cue- and stress- related effects on HP food motivation and intake suggests differential effects by BMI, that may in turn, point to different mechanisms that may drive weight gain and obesity risk in individuals who are lean versus those who are overweight.\\nOur findings also show differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin responses and their contribution to HP food motivation and intake. Stress and food cue exposure increased ghrelin responses, but significantly for the OW and not the LN group. Furthermore, only in the OW group was stress-induced ghrelin increases significantly associated with both HP food craving and subsequent HP food intake. While ghrelin has well known homeostatic effects on feeding function [46, 47], recent focus has been on its role in both stress and mood regulation as well as in hedonically motivated feeding behavior, partially via its effects on mesolimbic reward circuits [37, 48]. Findings indicate that ghrelin can shift preferences to high palatable foods and increase the motivational aspects of food reward [48]. Ghrelin is also known to increase with stress and is involved in regulating anxiety and mood (36, 49-51). Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that ghrelin administration increases the neural response to food pictures in areas associated with hedonic eating (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and ventral tegmental area) [52]. Additionally, there is growing evidence that feed-forward circuitry between stress and food reward maybe partly mediated by ghrelin [52, 53]. In the current study, as the effects were specific to the OW group, they suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions.\\nFinally, our findings also showed differential effects of cortisol responses to stress and food cue exposure. Notably, there was a significant increase in cortisol in the food cue relative to the neutral condition that was due to significant increases in cortisol in the lean group and not so in the OW group. Furthermore, food cue-related increases in cortisol was associated with greater food cue-related HP craving, suggesting a role for cortisol in food motivation. While glucocorticoids are often associated with the stress response, they are also known to play an important role in energy intake and regulation. Cortisol increases have been noted with intake of specific macronutrients, including carbohydrates, fats and proteins in animals and humans [6, 54], with the source of cortisol increases to be via both adrenal and extra-adrenal production [54]. Furthermore, in our previous neuroimaging study, increases in cortisol during a mild hypoglycemic state was associated with greater activation of brain reward regions that promoted greater food craving [44]. Together, this previous research supports current findings of the association between greater cortisol responses to food cue exposure with food cue-induced HP food craving.\\nWe did not see an overall significant increase in cortisol during stress exposure, but this was largely due to a lack of response in the OW group. Remarkably, the OW group showed blunted cortisol responses during stress and food cue relative to neutral conditions. This finding is consistent with growing evidence of blunted cortisol and autonomic responses to stress challenge in people who are OW or obese, along with altered autonomic and peripheral catecholamine responses to stress challenge in those weight groups [18, 21-25, 55]. HPA axis adaptations with low cortisol awakening responses have been reported in higher BMI groups, along with blunted responses to stress and reduced dopamine activity [20, 56]. Thus, the current findings of lack of cortisol increases in the OW group leads one to speculate that such HPA axis adaptations may contribute to higher HP food craving and intake in food cue and in stress contexts. However, this is speculation and would need further testing in future studies.\\nSeveral limitations of the current study need to be considered. First, the sample size was small and thus the findings are preliminary and need further validation. Also, due to the small sample size, sex differences and differential responses within the overweight groups were not assessed. It is possible that men and women differ in their food motivation and intake responses in food cue and stress contexts as shown in previous work [26,27]. Also, continuous assessment of BMI rather than arbitrary cutoffs for individuals in the lean, overweight and obese BMI range may provide greater sensitivity in assessing weight related adaptations. Thus, research with larger samples is required to replicate current findings and address these issues. Finally, as this study was conducted while participants were in a hospital, it is not clear whether the findings are generalizable to an outpatient experimental context or to real world food motivation and intake settings. On the other hand, as food cues and stress are among the most common contexts in which overeating of HP foods occur in the real world, the current study presents a well-controlled experimental model to study the biobehavioral processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake of highly palatable foods. Evidence of HP food motivation and increased snacking in these contexts is consistent with reports of obesogenic environments promoting increased HP food intake and weight gain in the real world. Furthermore, positive associations of HP food craving and intake by total ghrelin and cortisol responses suggests a role for metabolic and neuroendocrine adaptations in increased HP food motivation and intake.\\n</td>\n",

                   Key points:\\n- A systematic literature review found no negative association between sleep duration and athletic performance.\\n- Aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity.\\n- Tactical and technical skills in sports are improved by longer sleep duration.\\n- Sleep deprivation is associated with increased perceived effort but the relationship between perceived effort and objective performance has not been widely validated.\\n- Longer-term sleep extension may contribute to improved performance.\\n- More research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance.\\n\\nNumerical descriptors:\\n- None of the published studies reviewed found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome.\\n- Studies reporting significant positive results had varied effect sizes.\\n- 3 to 4 hours of sleep deprivation significantly impaired performance on the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test.\\n- 9 national-caliber collegiate weightlifters deprived of 24 hours of sleep did not show adverse effects on any of the weightlifting exercises examined.\\n- Tennis serving accuracy and basketball shooting were both improved by long-term sleep extension interventions.\\n- Soccer and rugby players exhibited performance deficits after nights of decreased sleep duration.   \n",

                                     New literature review finds that increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance among competitive athletes. None of the studies reviewed found a negative association between sleep duration and performance outcomes. Aerobic activity seems to be more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity. Most studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. The review suggests that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. Strategies to improve sleep not only the night before an important sports event but also in the weeks leading up to this event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance. #sleepscience #athleticperformance #sportsmedicine   \n",

has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. Studies measured outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills, most find benefits of sleep on performance. Longer-term sleep intervention studies involved sleep extension and showed positive results. Sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance on a short timescale. Future research should seek to investigate the mechanisms by which aerobic, tactical, and technical performance attributes may be preferentially sensitive to changes in sleep patterns. Competitive athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration.   \n",

has a positive impact on athletic performance among competitive athletes. None of the studies reviewed found a negative association. Aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration than anaerobic activity. Measures of tactical and technical skills are improved by sleep extension interventions. Short-term sleep deprivation may be harmful, while long-term sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. More research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. #sportsperformance #sleepduration #athletes\"   \n",

       "text                The Impact of Sleep Duration on Performance Among Competitive Athletes: A Systematic Literature Review\\n\\nDISCUSSION \\nThis literature review, although diverse in the range of sports, methods, and outcomes studied, provides several stylized facts that can inform sleep research and competitive athletes. First, out of all the published studies we reviewed, none found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome. All of the results reviewed showed that either the increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Note that among studies reporting significant positive results, effect sizes varied considerably (Tables 2-4), likely due to differences in the duration of sleep deprivation/extension experienced as well as differences in outcome measures. Second, when considering the aerobic and anaerobic characteristics of sports, it seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. For instance, Mejri et al40 found that depriving competitive taekwondo boxers of a mere 3 to 4 hours of sleep significantly impaired performance on the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test. By contrast, Blumert et al33 employed a relatively severe sleep deprivation protocol by depriving 9 national-caliber collegiate weightlifters of 24 hours of sleep and yet failed to identify adverse effects on any of the various weightlifting exercises examined. Relatedly, for both endurance and explosive, power-based exercises, it has been well documented that sleep deprivation is associated with increased perceived effort.56–58 Still, the relationship between perceived effort and objective performance has not been widely validated and is a topic for future investigation. Third, of the studies that measured outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills, most find benefits of sleep on performance. Tennis serving accuracy and basketball shooting were both improved by long-term sleep extension interventions,35,39 and tennis serving accuracy suffered when players were deprived of 2 to 2.5 hours of sleep at the beginning of the preceding night.37 Regarding studies conducted in players of team sports that incorporated tactics and decision-based outcomes to a broader extent, soccer as well as rugby players exhibited performance deficits after nights of decreased sleep duration.34 These results are in line with other literature demonstrating clear neurocognitive deficits in the setting of inadequate sleep in the general population, reviewed thoroughly elsewhere.59,60 Finally, when looking at the methodologies of the experimental studies, we found that the studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Interestingly although most acute sleep interventions involved sleep deprivation and yielded positive results, there were inconsistent results among the 2 acute sleep extension studies.15,38 Conversely, the majority of longer-term sleep intervention studies involved sleep extension and showed positive results.35,39,49 Taken together, these findings suggest that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. On the other hand, more research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. The reliability and precision of the various measurements may present challenges in interpretation of these studies. For example, “maximal” voluntary muscle contraction and voluntarily chosen training load are variable across subjects.61,62 On the other hand, “running economy,” the oxygen cost associated with a given running velocity, has low variability among highly trained runners and is significantly correlated with cardiorespiratory parameters used to assess aerobic capacity.63 A meta-analysis of the reliability of various measures of muscle power previously identified that field running tests tended to be more reliable than treadmill running tests, tests lasting up to 1 minute tended to be more reliable than those lasting greater than 1 minute (likely due to increased variability in muscle movement and limb positioning), and isokinetic tests tended to be more reliable when measuring muscle extension versus flexion.62 Somewhat reassuringly in the context of the present review, this metaanalysis also found that measurements taken from athletes were more reliable than those taken from non-athlete subjects. With respect to the validity of outcome measures reported as performance indicators, the nature of the sport (eg, team vs individual) may be an important determinant of whether what is measured in the laboratory translates to the actual game. For instance, for team-based sports requiring complex game structure such as soccer, measures of muscle force production or running speed are likely insufficient to provide an accurate assessment of in-game performance, although they may be helpful in making gross approximations and predictions.64 Of course, actual performance metrics from real or simulated games would be the ideal outcomes to quantify for such sports in future investigations. More specifically, for performance outcomes included in the current review, the following have been independently validated and shown to be reliable measures of athletic performance: Yo-Yo intermittent recovery (YYIR) test, isometric muscle contraction, squat, countermovement jump, free sthrow basketball shooting, tennis serving, shuttle-running tests, and Wingate test.42–48 In Table 1, we have indicated studies employing previously validated and reliable metrics of objective performance with asterisks (as per the criteria discussed above). Still, more work will be required to further validate the various performance outcomes measured in the studies reviewed in the present work, especially those involving complex, team-based measures such as composite game performance scores and passing accuracy. Likewise, given the high inter-individual variability of sleep variables used across the included studies, these metrics will also require further investigation to determine their precision and reliability as predictors of athletic performance. Importantly, we chose to require at least one objective performance measure among our inclusion criteria. The previous work relying on self-perceived performance, although informative in understanding the potential effect of sleep loss or gain on sports psychology,15 may not accurately reflect actual performance, as was the goal of the present work. However, under certain circumstances, self-perceived pre-game wellness (including self-reported sleep quality) may be predictive of objective in-game performance.65 More research will be needed to assess the validity of playerreported performance and objective performance, especially when athletes exhibit compromised sleep. Several experimental studies are particularly illustrative of the various trends in the results we have just outlined. To address the question of whether one night of sleep extension would be sufficient to improve various fitness indices among semi-professional soccer players, Fullagar et al15 tested a sleep hygiene intervention. The investigators implemented a sleep hygiene strategy (SHS) designed to maximize sleep duration and limit stimulation before bedtime to test whether this would be sufficient to improve either anaerobic (jumping height and force production) or aerobic endurance (Yo–Yo intermittent recovery level 2, YYIR2) performance after latenight soccer matches. Implementing a randomized design, they assigned 20 participants to follow either their normal post-match sleep routine [non-SHS (NSHS)] or a SHS involving early dimming of lights and lights out by midnight, cool room temperature, and no technology or light stimulation for 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. Actigraphy was used to measure sleep patterns, and sleep diary was used for subjective recall of sleep quality. Despite finding that those assigned to the SHS indeed exhibited increased sleep duration after the night match relative to those in the NSHS group, the investigators failed to identify any improvements in countermovement jump height, countermovement jump force production, or YYIR2 performance, tested over the following 2 days. On the other hand, as we have discussed, studies of acute sleep deprivation, especially those measuring technical performance outcomes, tended to yield positive results. Given that sleep is often disrupted the night before athletic competition,66 athletes involved in sports requiring these types of skills are likely to be particularly sensitive to sleep manipulations and thus should be counseled regarding the importance of sleep for game performance. Relatedly, chronic sleep extension studies have demonstrated significant benefits to athletes.35,49 Thus, strategies to improve sleep not only the night before an important sports event but also in the weeks leading up to this event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance. In this review, we have summarized and synthesized recent findings in the realm of sports and sleep science. One of the challenges of conducting such a literature review is that the study methodologies vary a great deal, as do the individual sports, making comparisons of effects and magnitudes of effect sizes across studies difficult. Additionally, unlike many studies of athletic performance and sleep conducted in nonathletes and recreational sports players, studies incorporating high-level competitors are limited, especially those implementing experimental approaches. Even among the best-controlled studies, sample sizes are small and sleep measurements vary considerably, with some studies measuring sleep duration objectively through polysomnography or actigraphy and others relying on self-report. All of these factors limit the scope of the conclusions that can be drawn. Nevertheless, they do provide valuable information about when sleep does or particularly when sleep does not seem to play a key role in influencing performance. Future research may seek to use larger sample sizes and standardize tests of athletic performance in order to identify optimal sleep standards, in addition to standardizing sleep metrics and incorporating more objective sleep data. In particular, here we focused on studies investigating sleep duration, although sleep timing is likely to be a relevant factor as well. As sleep onset and wake time have previously been shown to influence performance and recovery,5 future studies should aim to incorporate this information. Given these suggestions for improving future research, there are many opportunities for innovative research on this topic. One area in particular may be about how generalizable these findings are to other sports. Given the wide range of methodologies and used in these studies, another research goal would be to harmonize measures across studies and conduct a meta-analysis. Another area to investigate is trade-offs between wake time activities (eg, athletic practice) and sleep. For example, is it beneficial for swimmers to practice early in the morning even at the expense of their sleep? Research also should seek to investigate the mechanisms by which aerobic, tactical, and technical performance attributes may be preferentially sensitive to changes in sleep patterns. One limitation of the present work is that although the number of hours and/or nights of sleep interventions across studies varied, sleep duration was only measured the night before performance assessment. Thus, in order to obtain a more complete picture of sleep quantity and quality, future research should aim to measure sleep across the entire study period. Another limitation is that few of the studies examined explicitly the relationship between subjective sleep quality and performance, especially using validated sleep quality questionnaires such as the PSQI and ESS. Thus, this remains an open question that will be important to be investigated in the future. Once all these data are gathered, feasible and effective interventions should be developed, implemented, and evaluated to improve the sleep health and optimal performance of athletes. In conclusion, the importance of sleep for professional athletes to achieve high performance varies by the cognitive and physical demands of the sport. However, because most sports require integration of aerobic fitness, tactical skills, and technical skills, competitive athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration.  \\n   \n",

                                                              Sleep is important for athletes to perform well. Studies show that getting enough sleep does not have a negative effect on athletic performance. Doing activities that require a lot of oxygen, like running, are more affected by lack of sleep than activities that don't require as much oxygen, like weightlifting. Sleeping longer can also help improve skills in sports. When athletes don't get enough sleep, they may feel like they are working harder than they actually are, but this hasn't been proven yet. Sleeping more over a longer period of time can also help improve performance. However, more research is needed to understand how not getting enough sleep for a long time can affect athletic performance.   \n",

affects how well athletes perform. They found that getting more sleep can help athletes do better. None of the studies they looked at showed that getting more sleep made athletes do worse. Doing exercises that make you breathe harder (like running) is affected more by sleep than exercises that don't (like lifting weights). When athletes got more sleep over a long time, they did better than when they only got more sleep right before a big event. So, it's important for athletes to get good sleep not just the night before a big game, but also in the weeks leading up to it.   \n",

They found that getting more sleep can help athletes do better, especially when they need to use their muscles for a long time (like running). It also helps with skills that need a lot of thinking and planning. Some studies even showed that making athletes sleep longer for a while can help them perform better in the long run. Not getting enough sleep can be worse for performance than getting more sleep is good. Scientists still need to figure out exactly why sleep helps athletes, but it's clear that getting enough sleep is important for athletes who want to do their best.   \n",

They found that getting enough sleep helps athletes do better in their sport. None of the studies found that not getting enough sleep made athletes do worse. Doing activities that make you breathe hard (like running) are more affected by sleep than activities that don't (like weightlifting). Practicing skills and strategies also gets better when athletes get more sleep. Not getting enough sleep for a short time can be bad, but getting more sleep for a long time can help. We need more research to see if not getting enough sleep for a long time can hurt athletes. #sportsperformance #sleepduration #athletes   \n",

They found that getting more sleep is good for athletes' endurance and skills. But not getting enough sleep can be bad for them. The study suggests that more research is needed to understand why this happens.   \n",

                        Hey, did you know that a systematic literature review found that there is no negative association between sleep duration and athletic performance? In fact, increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. The review also found that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. The studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Interestingly, although most acute sleep interventions involved sleep deprivation and yielded positive results, there were inconsistent results among the 2 acute sleep extension studies. This suggests that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance.   \n",

association between sleep duration and athletic performance? In fact, increased sleep duration had a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. It seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity. For performance outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills, most studies found benefits of sleep on performance. Additionally, studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. However, more research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. Overall, it seems that competitive athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration.   \n",

duration and athletic performance? In fact, increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. They also found that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. And, of the studies that measured outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills, most find benefits of sleep on performance. Finally, the studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely.   \n",

know that a systematic literature review found that none of the published studies reviewed found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome for competitive athletes? In fact, all of the results reviewed showed that increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Also, it seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity. The studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Lastly, studies that measured outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills found benefits of sleep on performance. Tennis serving accuracy and basketball shooting were both improved by long-term sleep extension interventions, and tennis serving accuracy suffered when players were deprived of 2 to 2.5 hours of sleep at the beginning of the preceding night.   \n",

       "text                The Impact of Sleep Duration on Performance Among Competitive Athletes: A Systematic Literature Review\\n\\nDISCUSSION \\nThis literature review, although diverse in the range of sports, methods, and outcomes studied, provides several stylized facts that can inform sleep research and competitive athletes. First, out of all the published studies we reviewed, none found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome. All of the results reviewed showed that either the increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Note that among studies reporting significant positive results, effect sizes varied considerably (Tables 2-4), likely due to differences in the duration of sleep deprivation/extension experienced as well as differences in outcome measures. Second, when considering the aerobic and anaerobic characteristics of sports, it seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. For instance, Mejri et al40 found that depriving competitive taekwondo boxers of a mere 3 to 4 hours of sleep significantly impaired performance on the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test. By contrast, Blumert et al33 employed a relatively severe sleep deprivation protocol by depriving 9 national-caliber collegiate weightlifters of 24 hours of sleep and yet failed to identify adverse effects on any of the various weightlifting exercises examined. Relatedly, for both endurance and explosive, power-based exercises, it has been well documented that sleep deprivation is associated with increased perceived effort.56–58 Still, the relationship between perceived effort and objective performance has not been widely validated and is a topic for future investigation. Third, of the studies that measured outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills, most find benefits of sleep on performance. Tennis serving accuracy and basketball shooting were both improved by long-term sleep extension interventions,35,39 and tennis serving accuracy suffered when players were deprived of 2 to 2.5 hours of sleep at the beginning of the preceding night.37 Regarding studies conducted in players of team sports that incorporated tactics and decision-based outcomes to a broader extent, soccer as well as rugby players exhibited performance deficits after nights of decreased sleep duration.34 These results are in line with other literature demonstrating clear neurocognitive deficits in the setting of inadequate sleep in the general population, reviewed thoroughly elsewhere.59,60 Finally, when looking at the methodologies of the experimental studies, we found that the studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Interestingly although most acute sleep interventions involved sleep deprivation and yielded positive results, there were inconsistent results among the 2 acute sleep extension studies.15,38 Conversely, the majority of longer-term sleep intervention studies involved sleep extension and showed positive results.35,39,49 Taken together, these findings suggest that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. On the other hand, more research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. The reliability and precision of the various measurements may present challenges in interpretation of these studies. For example, “maximal” voluntary muscle contraction and voluntarily chosen training load are variable across subjects.61,62 On the other hand, “running economy,” the oxygen cost associated with a given running velocity, has low variability among highly trained runners and is significantly correlated with cardiorespiratory parameters used to assess aerobic capacity.63 A meta-analysis of the reliability of various measures of muscle power previously identified that field running tests tended to be more reliable than treadmill running tests, tests lasting up to 1 minute tended to be more reliable than those lasting greater than 1 minute (likely due to increased variability in muscle movement and limb positioning), and isokinetic tests tended to be more reliable when measuring muscle extension versus flexion.62 Somewhat reassuringly in the context of the present review, this metaanalysis also found that measurements taken from athletes were more reliable than those taken from non-athlete subjects. With respect to the validity of outcome measures reported as performance indicators, the nature of the sport (eg, team vs individual) may be an important determinant of whether what is measured in the laboratory translates to the actual game. For instance, for team-based sports requiring complex game structure such as soccer, measures of muscle force production or running speed are likely insufficient to provide an accurate assessment of in-game performance, although they may be helpful in making gross approximations and predictions.64 Of course, actual performance metrics from real or simulated games would be the ideal outcomes to quantify for such sports in future investigations. More specifically, for performance outcomes included in the current review, the following have been independently validated and shown to be reliable measures of athletic performance: Yo-Yo intermittent recovery (YYIR) test, isometric muscle contraction, squat, countermovement jump, free sthrow basketball shooting, tennis serving, shuttle-running tests, and Wingate test.42–48 In Table 1, we have indicated studies employing previously validated and reliable metrics of objective performance with asterisks (as per the criteria discussed above). Still, more work will be required to further validate the various performance outcomes measured in the studies reviewed in the present work, especially those involving complex, team-based measures such as composite game performance scores and passing accuracy. Likewise, given the high inter-individual variability of sleep variables used across the included studies, these metrics will also require further investigation to determine their precision and reliability as predictors of athletic performance. Importantly, we chose to require at least one objective performance measure among our inclusion criteria. The previous work relying on self-perceived performance, although informative in understanding the potential effect of sleep loss or gain on sports psychology,15 may not accurately reflect actual performance, as was the goal of the present work. However, under certain circumstances, self-perceived pre-game wellness (including self-reported sleep quality) may be predictive of objective in-game performance.65 More research will be needed to assess the validity of playerreported performance and objective performance, especially when athletes exhibit compromised sleep. Several experimental studies are particularly illustrative of the various trends in the results we have just outlined. To address the question of whether one night of sleep extension would be sufficient to improve various fitness indices among semi-professional soccer players, Fullagar et al15 tested a sleep hygiene intervention. The investigators implemented a sleep hygiene strategy (SHS) designed to maximize sleep duration and limit stimulation before bedtime to test whether this would be sufficient to improve either anaerobic (jumping height and force production) or aerobic endurance (Yo–Yo intermittent recovery level 2, YYIR2) performance after latenight soccer matches. Implementing a randomized design, they assigned 20 participants to follow either their normal post-match sleep routine [non-SHS (NSHS)] or a SHS involving early dimming of lights and lights out by midnight, cool room temperature, and no technology or light stimulation for 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. Actigraphy was used to measure sleep patterns, and sleep diary was used for subjective recall of sleep quality. Despite finding that those assigned to the SHS indeed exhibited increased sleep duration after the night match relative to those in the NSHS group, the investigators failed to identify any improvements in countermovement jump height, countermovement jump force production, or YYIR2 performance, tested over the following 2 days. On the other hand, as we have discussed, studies of acute sleep deprivation, especially those measuring technical performance outcomes, tended to yield positive results. Given that sleep is often disrupted the night before athletic competition,66 athletes involved in sports requiring these types of skills are likely to be particularly sensitive to sleep manipulations and thus should be counseled regarding the importance of sleep for game performance. Relatedly, chronic sleep extension studies have demonstrated significant benefits to athletes.35,49 Thus, strategies to improve sleep not only the night before an important sports event but also in the weeks leading up to this event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance. In this review, we have summarized and synthesized recent findings in the realm of sports and sleep science. One of the challenges of conducting such a literature review is that the study methodologies vary a great deal, as do the individual sports, making comparisons of effects and magnitudes of effect sizes across studies difficult. Additionally, unlike many studies of athletic performance and sleep conducted in nonathletes and recreational sports players, studies incorporating high-level competitors are limited, especially those implementing experimental approaches. Even among the best-controlled studies, sample sizes are small and sleep measurements vary considerably, with some studies measuring sleep duration objectively through polysomnography or actigraphy and others relying on self-report. All of these factors limit the scope of the conclusions that can be drawn. Nevertheless, they do provide valuable information about when sleep does or particularly when sleep does not seem to play a key role in influencing performance. Future research may seek to use larger sample sizes and standardize tests of athletic performance in order to identify optimal sleep standards, in addition to standardizing sleep metrics and incorporating more objective sleep data. In particular, here we focused on studies investigating sleep duration, although sleep timing is likely to be a relevant factor as well. As sleep onset and wake time have previously been shown to influence performance and recovery,5 future studies should aim to incorporate this information. Given these suggestions for improving future research, there are many opportunities for innovative research on this topic. One area in particular may be about how generalizable these findings are to other sports. Given the wide range of methodologies and used in these studies, another research goal would be to harmonize measures across studies and conduct a meta-analysis. Another area to investigate is trade-offs between wake time activities (eg, athletic practice) and sleep. For example, is it beneficial for swimmers to practice early in the morning even at the expense of their sleep? Research also should seek to investigate the mechanisms by which aerobic, tactical, and technical performance attributes may be preferentially sensitive to changes in sleep patterns. One limitation of the present work is that although the number of hours and/or nights of sleep interventions across studies varied, sleep duration was only measured the night before performance assessment. Thus, in order to obtain a more complete picture of sleep quantity and quality, future research should aim to measure sleep across the entire study period. Another limitation is that few of the studies examined explicitly the relationship between subjective sleep quality and performance, especially using validated sleep quality questionnaires such as the PSQI and ESS. Thus, this remains an open question that will be important to be investigated in the future. Once all these data are gathered, feasible and effective interventions should be developed, implemented, and evaluated to improve the sleep health and optimal performance of athletes. In conclusion, the importance of sleep for professional athletes to achieve high performance varies by the cognitive and physical demands of the sport. However, because most sports require integration of aerobic fitness, tactical skills, and technical skills, competitive athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration.  \\n   \n",

athletes? A study looked at lots of other studies and found that sleeping more doesn't hurt how well you do in sports. In fact, it can actually help! The study also found that doing exercises that make you breathe hard (like running) is affected more by sleep than exercises that make you strong (like lifting weights). The studies that looked at sleep over a long time showed more of an effect than the ones that only looked at sleep for a short time. It's also interesting that when people were kept awake for a long time, they did worse in sports, but when they were allowed to sleep more, the results were mixed. This means that not getting enough sleep can be worse than getting more sleep is good for sports, but in the long run, getting more sleep can help you do better.   \n",

                                       Did you know that getting enough sleep can help you do better in sports? A study looked at lots of other studies and found that athletes who slept more did better or didn't do worse than those who slept less. This was especially true for sports that need a lot of running or endurance. For sports that need more thinking and strategy, sleep also helped. But we still need more research to see if not getting enough sleep for a long time can hurt athletes. So, if you want to do your best in sports, make sure you get enough sleep!   \n",

make you worse at sports? Actually, it can make you better or not change anything. Running and other exercises that make you breathe hard are affected more by sleep than lifting weights. Also, sleeping helps you do better at sports that need thinking and skill. And if you sleep more for a long time, it's more likely to help than if you just sleep more for one night.   \n",

                                           Did you know that getting enough sleep is really important for athletes? A bunch of studies looked at this and found that when athletes slept more, they did better in their sport or didn't do worse. This was especially true for sports that need a lot of running or other exercises that make you breathe hard. The studies that looked at sleep over a longer time found more benefits than the ones that only looked at one night. Also, if a sport needs a lot of thinking and skill, sleep is even more important. For example, tennis players who slept more were better at serving the ball, and basketball players were better at shooting. But if they didn't get enough sleep the night before, their serving or shooting wasn't as good.   \n",

A bunch of studies looked at how sleep affects how well athletes perform, and they found that getting more sleep can actually help them do better! This is especially true for activities like running or biking, but not as much for things like lifting weights. It's also better to get more sleep over a longer period of time, instead of just one night. And if an athlete needs to use their brain a lot during their sport, like for strategy or technique, getting enough sleep is even more important. So, it's really important for athletes to make sure they get enough sleep to do their best!   \n",

and stress on highly palatable food intake and craving. Results show that exposure to both food cues and stress leads to increased HP food craving and subsequent snacking. Ghrelin and cortisol levels were found to impact food motivation differently in lean and overweight individuals. The study highlights the need for further investigation into the biobehavioral processes underlying food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations. #foodcraving #stress #ghrelin #cortisol #obesity #healthresearch   \n",

with healthy community adults has found that exposure to food cues and stressors increases highly palatable (HP) food craving and subsequent snacking of HP foods. The study also found differential effects by body mass index (BMI) group, with stress-induced HP food craving predicting subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group. Furthermore, the findings suggest weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions. Overall, the study sheds light on the biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations. #foodcravings #obesity #healthresearch   \n",

snacking of HP foods. The study also found differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups, with stress-induced HP food craving predicting subsequent intake only in the overweight group. Ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across BMI groups. The study suggests a need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations. #foodcravings #stress #HPfood #obesity #BMI #nutrition   \n",

laboratory experiment, exposure to both personal food cues and stressors resulted in increases in highly palatable food craving and subsequent snacking. Lean and overweight individuals showed differential effects in response to stress and food cue exposure. Ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation, with weight-related adaptations in ghrelin potentially shifting food motivation towards hedonic regulation under stress conditions. The study highlights the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying highly palatable food motivation and intake in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations. #foodcraving #stress #ghrelin #cortisol #obesity #biobehavioralprocesses #sciencecommunication   \n",

       "text                Food craving, cortisol and ghrelin responses in modeling highly palatable snack intake in the laboratory\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nThis preliminary study is the first to directly compare the effects of both food cue and stress exposure on HP food craving and HP food intake in a 3-day human laboratory experiment conducted within a controlled hospital-based setting with healthy community adults. As both the ubiquitous HP food environment and stressors are known to increase HP food intake and obesity risk, a direct comparison of these contexts could identify similar and differential processes that may underlie food motivation and intake. As hypothesized, and similar to our previous work in addiction [18], we found that exposure to both personal food cues and to personal stressors relative to a neutral relaxing control cue resulted in increases in HP food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods in a standardized Food Snack Test (FST), but with differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups. Furthermore, we found that increased food craving in these contexts was highly associated with subsequent amounts of HP food snack intake. Finally, both ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. Together, these results support the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.\\nExposure to food cue imagery led to significant increases in HP food craving prior to the presentation of the FST at the pre-snack timepoint in both lean and OW individuals. Moreover, food cue-related increases in food craving predicted significant increases in HP snack intake across both lean and OW individuals. These data are consistent with a significant literature indicating that rewarding stimuli and their related contexts increase motivation and wanting of rewarding stimuli via conditioning and/or incentive salience mechanisms [4, 20, 42]. Also, a number of basic science and human neuroimaging studies have shown that food cue stimulus exposure increases food craving and activate brain reward and motivation regions [4, 7-11, 18, 43, 44]. Current findings further indicate that such food cue-related increases in HP food craving promote HP snack intake with greater intake of HP foods in the food cue context relative to the neutral relaxing contexts across individuals. These data validate the real-world contexts of advertising of HP foods to promote greater sales and intake of HP foods.\\nIn contrast, we found a differential impact of stress on HP food craving and intake by BMI group where stress significantly increased food craving relative to the neutral condition, but only in the overweight and not the lean group. Furthermore, stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group, suggesting that food motivational processes may be relevant in identifying those who are vulnerable to stress-induced eating. Previous laboratory studies have shown mixed results with some showing stress increasing food intake [17, 24], but others reporting no consistent increases in intake [23, 45]. While the methodology has varied across these studies, current findings suggest the need for direct comparison of BMI groups and consideration of weight-related adaptations in assessing stress effects on HP food motivation and intake. Current findings are also supported by a growing literature suggesting that BMI-related alterations impact not only metabolic hormones but also stress and reward processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake [18, 20, 44]. Together our findings on food cue- and stress- related effects on HP food motivation and intake suggests differential effects by BMI, that may in turn, point to different mechanisms that may drive weight gain and obesity risk in individuals who are lean versus those who are overweight.\\nOur findings also show differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin responses and their contribution to HP food motivation and intake. Stress and food cue exposure increased ghrelin responses, but significantly for the OW and not the LN group. Furthermore, only in the OW group was stress-induced ghrelin increases significantly associated with both HP food craving and subsequent HP food intake. While ghrelin has well known homeostatic effects on feeding function [46, 47], recent focus has been on its role in both stress and mood regulation as well as in hedonically motivated feeding behavior, partially via its effects on mesolimbic reward circuits [37, 48]. Findings indicate that ghrelin can shift preferences to high palatable foods and increase the motivational aspects of food reward [48]. Ghrelin is also known to increase with stress and is involved in regulating anxiety and mood (36, 49-51). Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that ghrelin administration increases the neural response to food pictures in areas associated with hedonic eating (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and ventral tegmental area) [52]. Additionally, there is growing evidence that feed-forward circuitry between stress and food reward maybe partly mediated by ghrelin [52, 53]. In the current study, as the effects were specific to the OW group, they suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions.\\nFinally, our findings also showed differential effects of cortisol responses to stress and food cue exposure. Notably, there was a significant increase in cortisol in the food cue relative to the neutral condition that was due to significant increases in cortisol in the lean group and not so in the OW group. Furthermore, food cue-related increases in cortisol was associated with greater food cue-related HP craving, suggesting a role for cortisol in food motivation. While glucocorticoids are often associated with the stress response, they are also known to play an important role in energy intake and regulation. Cortisol increases have been noted with intake of specific macronutrients, including carbohydrates, fats and proteins in animals and humans [6, 54], with the source of cortisol increases to be via both adrenal and extra-adrenal production [54]. Furthermore, in our previous neuroimaging study, increases in cortisol during a mild hypoglycemic state was associated with greater activation of brain reward regions that promoted greater food craving [44]. Together, this previous research supports current findings of the association between greater cortisol responses to food cue exposure with food cue-induced HP food craving.\\nWe did not see an overall significant increase in cortisol during stress exposure, but this was largely due to a lack of response in the OW group. Remarkably, the OW group showed blunted cortisol responses during stress and food cue relative to neutral conditions. This finding is consistent with growing evidence of blunted cortisol and autonomic responses to stress challenge in people who are OW or obese, along with altered autonomic and peripheral catecholamine responses to stress challenge in those weight groups [18, 21-25, 55]. HPA axis adaptations with low cortisol awakening responses have been reported in higher BMI groups, along with blunted responses to stress and reduced dopamine activity [20, 56]. Thus, the current findings of lack of cortisol increases in the OW group leads one to speculate that such HPA axis adaptations may contribute to higher HP food craving and intake in food cue and in stress contexts. However, this is speculation and would need further testing in future studies.\\nSeveral limitations of the current study need to be considered. First, the sample size was small and thus the findings are preliminary and need further validation. Also, due to the small sample size, sex differences and differential responses within the overweight groups were not assessed. It is possible that men and women differ in their food motivation and intake responses in food cue and stress contexts as shown in previous work [26,27]. Also, continuous assessment of BMI rather than arbitrary cutoffs for individuals in the lean, overweight and obese BMI range may provide greater sensitivity in assessing weight related adaptations. Thus, research with larger samples is required to replicate current findings and address these issues. Finally, as this study was conducted while participants were in a hospital, it is not clear whether the findings are generalizable to an outpatient experimental context or to real world food motivation and intake settings. On the other hand, as food cues and stress are among the most common contexts in which overeating of HP foods occur in the real world, the current study presents a well-controlled experimental model to study the biobehavioral processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake of highly palatable foods. Evidence of HP food motivation and increased snacking in these contexts is consistent with reports of obesogenic environments promoting increased HP food intake and weight gain in the real world. Furthermore, positive associations of HP food craving and intake by total ghrelin and cortisol responses suggests a role for metabolic and neuroendocrine adaptations in increased HP food motivation and intake.\\n   \n",

looked at how seeing pictures of yummy food and feeling stressed affects how much people eat and want to eat. The results showed that when people see food pictures and feel stressed, they want to eat more and end up snacking more. The study also found that two hormones, ghrelin and cortisol, affect how much people want to eat differently depending on if they are thin or overweight. This study shows that we need to learn more about how our bodies and brains work together when it comes to eating, especially for people who struggle with their weight.   \n",

stressed about yummy foods, they want to eat them more. This is especially true for people who are overweight. The study also found that our bodies might change when we gain weight, making us want to eat yummy foods even more when we're stressed.

new study found that when people see yummy food and feel stressed, they want to eat more of that food and end up snacking on it. The study also found that this happens more to people who are overweight. Two hormones in our body, called ghrelin and cortisol, can make us want to eat more, but they affect people differently depending on their weight. This study shows that we need to learn more about why we crave certain foods and how our bodies react to them, especially if we want to understand why some people gain weight more easily than others.   \n",

them stressed. They ended up wanting to eat more of the yummy food and snacking more. People who were thin and people who were overweight reacted differently to the stress and pictures of food. Two hormones in our body, ghrelin and cortisol, made people want to eat more. People who were overweight had more of one of these hormones, which made them want to eat more when they were stressed. This study shows that we need to learn more about how our body and brain work together to make us want to eat certain foods, especially when we are stressed.   \n",

snack more. The study was done with healthy adults in a hospital. It also found that people who are overweight might be affected differently than people who are not. Two hormones in our body, ghrelin and cortisol, can make us want to eat more. This study shows that we need to learn more about why we crave certain foods and how it affects our health.   \n",

               Hey, did you know that a recent study found that exposure to both personal food cues and personal stressors increases highly palatable (HP) food craving and subsequent snacking of HP foods? The study also found that ghrelin and cortisol significantly impact food motivation, but differently across lean and overweight individuals. In fact, stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight group, suggesting that food motivational processes may be relevant in identifying those who are vulnerable to stress-induced eating. Also, the study found that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions. Overall, the study presents a well-controlled experimental model to study the biobehavioral processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake of highly palatable foods.  \n",

exposure to both personal food cues and personal stressors can increase highly palatable (HP) food craving and subsequent snacking of HP foods? The study was conducted with healthy community adults and found that the effects of food cue and stress exposure on HP food craving and intake differed between lean and overweight BMI groups. The study also found that both ghrelin and cortisol impact food motivation differently across these groups. Interestingly, increased ghrelin responses were found to be associated with HP food craving and intake only in the overweight group, suggesting that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions. Overall, the study suggests that biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake need further investigation, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.  \n",

I just read about a study that compared the effects of food cue and stress exposure on highly palatable (HP) food craving and intake. They found that exposure to both food cues and stress resulted in increases in HP food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods. Interestingly, they also found differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups. Stress significantly increased food craving relative to the neutral condition, but only in the overweight and not the lean group. Furthermore, stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group. They also found that both ghrelin and cortisol significantly impacted food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. The findings suggest the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.  \n",

                                                    Hey, did you hear about the recent study on food craving, cortisol and ghrelin responses? The study found that exposure to both personal food cues and stressors resulted in increases in highly palatable (HP) food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods. This was validated by real-world contexts of advertising of HP foods to promote greater sales and intake of HP foods. Interestingly, the study also found differential effects of stress on HP food craving and intake by BMI group where stress significantly increased food craving, but only in the overweight and not the lean group. Furthermore, the study showed differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin responses and their contribution to HP food motivation and intake. In addition, the study found that cortisol responses to food cue exposure were associated with greater food cue-induced HP food craving. Overall, these findings suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions.  \n",

hospital setting found that exposure to both food cues and stress led to increased craving and subsequent snacking of highly palatable foods? The study also found that the effects of food cue and stress exposure on food motivation and intake differed between lean and overweight individuals, with stress significantly increasing food craving and subsequent intake only in the overweight group. The study also revealed that ghrelin and cortisol responses significantly impacted food motivation, with ghrelin associated with hedonic regulation of food reward and cortisol associated with food cue-induced craving. Interestingly, the study found that overweight individuals had blunted cortisol responses to stress and food cues, potentially contributing to increased craving and intake of highly palatable foods. Overall, the findings suggest the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying highly palatable food motivation and intake.  \n",

As both the ubiquitous HP food environment and stressors are known to increase HP food intake and obesity risk, a direct comparison of these contexts could identify similar and differential processes that may underlie food motivation and intake. As hypothesized, and similar to our previous work in addiction [18], we found that exposure to both personal food cues and to personal stressors relative to a neutral relaxing control cue resulted in increases in HP food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods in a standardized Food Snack Test (FST), but with differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups. Furthermore, we found that increased food craving in these contexts was highly associated with subsequent amounts of HP food snack intake. Finally, both ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. Together, these results support the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.\\nExposure to food cue imagery led to significant increases in HP food craving prior to the presentation of the FST at the pre-snack timepoint in both lean and OW individuals. Moreover, food cue-related increases in food craving predicted significant increases in HP snack intake across both lean and OW individuals. These data are consistent with a significant literature indicating that rewarding stimuli and their related contexts increase motivation and wanting of rewarding stimuli via conditioning and/or incentive salience mechanisms [4, 20, 42]. Also, a number of basic science and human neuroimaging studies have shown that food cue stimulus exposure increases food craving and activate brain reward and motivation regions [4, 7-11, 18, 43, 44]. Current findings further indicate that such food cue-related increases in HP food craving promote HP snack intake with greater intake of HP foods in the food cue context relative to the neutral relaxing contexts across individuals. These data validate the real-world contexts of advertising of HP foods to promote greater sales and intake of HP foods.\\nIn contrast, we found a differential impact of stress on HP food craving and intake by BMI group where stress significantly increased food craving relative to the neutral condition, but only in the overweight and not the lean group. Furthermore, stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group, suggesting that food motivational processes may be relevant in identifying those who are vulnerable to stress-induced eating. Previous laboratory studies have shown mixed results with some showing stress increasing food intake [17, 24], but others reporting no consistent increases in intake [23, 45]. While the methodology has varied across these studies, current findings suggest the need for direct comparison of BMI groups and consideration of weight-related adaptations in assessing stress effects on HP food motivation and intake. Current findings are also supported by a growing literature suggesting that BMI-related alterations impact not only metabolic hormones but also stress and reward processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake [18, 20, 44]. Together our findings on food cue- and stress- related effects on HP food motivation and intake suggests differential effects by BMI, that may in turn, point to different mechanisms that may drive weight gain and obesity risk in individuals who are lean versus those who are overweight.\\nOur findings also show differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin responses and their contribution to HP food motivation and intake. Stress and food cue exposure increased ghrelin responses, but significantly for the OW and not the LN group. Furthermore, only in the OW group was stress-induced ghrelin increases significantly associated with both HP food craving and subsequent HP food intake. While ghrelin has well known homeostatic effects on feeding function [46, 47], recent focus has been on its role in both stress and mood regulation as well as in hedonically motivated feeding behavior, partially via its effects on mesolimbic reward circuits [37, 48]. Findings indicate that ghrelin can shift preferences to high palatable foods and increase the motivational aspects of food reward [48]. Ghrelin is also known to increase with stress and is involved in regulating anxiety and mood (36, 49-51). Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that ghrelin administration increases the neural response to food pictures in areas associated with hedonic eating (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and ventral tegmental area) [52]. Additionally, there is growing evidence that feed-forward circuitry between stress and food reward maybe partly mediated by ghrelin [52, 53]. In the current study, as the effects were specific to the OW group, they suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions.\\nFinally, our findings also showed differential effects of cortisol responses to stress and food cue exposure. Notably, there was a significant increase in cortisol in the food cue relative to the neutral condition that was due to significant increases in cortisol in the lean group and not so in the OW group. Furthermore, food cue-related increases in cortisol was associated with greater food cue-related HP craving, suggesting a role for cortisol in food motivation. While glucocorticoids are often associated with the stress response, they are also known to play an important role in energy intake and regulation. Cortisol increases have been noted with intake of specific macronutrients, including carbohydrates, fats and proteins in animals and humans [6, 54], with the source of cortisol increases to be via both adrenal and extra-adrenal production [54]. Furthermore, in our previous neuroimaging study, increases in cortisol during a mild hypoglycemic state was associated with greater activation of brain reward regions that promoted greater food craving [44]. Together, this previous research supports current findings of the association between greater cortisol responses to food cue exposure with food cue-induced HP food craving.\\nWe did not see an overall significant increase in cortisol during stress exposure, but this was largely due to a lack of response in the OW group. Remarkably, the OW group showed blunted cortisol responses during stress and food cue relative to neutral conditions. This finding is consistent with growing evidence of blunted cortisol and autonomic responses to stress challenge in people who are OW or obese, along with altered autonomic and peripheral catecholamine responses to stress challenge in those weight groups [18, 21-25, 55]. HPA axis adaptations with low cortisol awakening responses have been reported in higher BMI groups, along with blunted responses to stress and reduced dopamine activity [20, 56]. Thus, the current findings of lack of cortisol increases in the OW group leads one to speculate that such HPA axis adaptations may contribute to higher HP food craving and intake in food cue and in stress contexts. However, this is speculation and would need further testing in future studies.\\nSeveral limitations of the current study need to be considered. First, the sample size was small and thus the findings are preliminary and need further validation. Also, due to the small sample size, sex differences and differential responses within the overweight groups were not assessed. It is possible that men and women differ in their food motivation and intake responses in food cue and stress contexts as shown in previous work [26,27]. Also, continuous assessment of BMI rather than arbitrary cutoffs for individuals in the lean, overweight and obese BMI range may provide greater sensitivity in assessing weight related adaptations. Thus, research with larger samples is required to replicate current findings and address these issues. Finally, as this study was conducted while participants were in a hospital, it is not clear whether the findings are generalizable to an outpatient experimental context or to real world food motivation and intake settings. On the other hand, as food cues and stress are among the most common contexts in which overeating of HP foods occur in the real world, the current study presents a well-controlled experimental model to study the biobehavioral processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake of highly palatable foods. Evidence of HP food motivation and increased snacking in these contexts is consistent with reports of obesogenic environments promoting increased HP food intake and weight gain in the real world. Furthermore, positive associations of HP food craving and intake by total ghrelin and cortisol responses suggests a role for metabolic and neuroendocrine adaptations in increased HP food motivation and intake.\\n  \n",

Hey, did you know that when we see or feel stressed, we tend to crave and eat more unhealthy foods? This is because our body releases hormones that make us want to eat these foods. The study found that this is especially true for people who are overweight. It also found that our body's hormones can affect how much we want to eat, and this can be different for people who are lean or overweight. The study helps us understand why some people may eat more unhealthy foods when they are stressed, and how our body's hormones can affect our food choices.  \n",

                               Hey, did you know that when we see or think about yummy food and feel stressed, we might want to eat more of that yummy food? A study found that this happens more to people who are overweight than those who are not. The study also found that two hormones in our body, ghrelin and cortisol, affect our desire for food differently depending on our weight. The study suggests that we need to learn more about how our body and mind work together when we want to eat yummy food, especially if we are trying to lose weight.  \n",

I just read about a study that looked at how seeing yummy food and feeling stressed affects how much people eat. They found that when people saw yummy food and felt stressed, they wanted to eat more of that yummy food and ended up snacking on it more. They also found that this happened more in people who were overweight than in people who were not overweight. They also found that two hormones in our body, ghrelin and cortisol, can affect how much we want to eat, but this happens differently in people who are overweight compared to people who are not overweight. This study shows that we need to learn more about how our body and mind work together when it comes to wanting to eat yummy food, especially for people who are trying to manage their weight.  \n",

They found that when people are stressed and see pictures of tasty food, they are more likely to want to eat those foods and snack on them. This is why companies use pictures of yummy food in their ads to make people want to buy and eat more of those foods. The study also found that stress affects overweight people more than people who are not overweight. The study also looked at how different hormones in our body affect our desire to eat unhealthy foods. Overall, the study suggests that when we are stressed, our body might make us want to eat unhealthy foods more.  \n",

                      Did you know that when we see or think about yummy food and feel stressed, we tend to want to eat more of it? This is especially true for people who are overweight. Our body chemicals, ghrelin and cortisol, also play a role in making us want to eat more. The study found that overweight people have a weaker response to these chemicals, which might make them crave and eat more unhealthy food. This study shows that we need to learn more about why we crave and eat unhealthy food so we can find ways to make healthier choices.  \n",
