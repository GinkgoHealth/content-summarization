       "{'text': 'Effect of dietary sources of calcium and protein on hip fractures and falls in older adults in residential care cluster randomised controlled trial\\nDiscussion\\nThis nutritional approach using high calcium and high protein dairy foods to increase calcium and protein intakes in institutionalised older adults replete in vitamin D was associated with a 33% reduction in risk of fractures of any type, a 46% reduction in risk of hip fractures, and an 11% reduction in risk of falls relative to controls. We found no group difference in all cause mortality.\\nMost interventions aimed at reducing fracture risk target a drug therapy to people with osteoporosis because they are at high risk of fracture. This approach confers a large benefit to the individual and does so cost effectively, because few people need to be treated to avert one event. However, averting fractures in small numbers of people at high risk does not reduce the burden of fractures in the community.\\nThe population burden of fractures\\x97the number of events, morbidity, mortality, and cost to the community\\x97arises from the vast numbers of people with risk factors that confer a modest attributable risk to the individual.17\\xa0For example, most fragility fractures in the community arise among women with osteopenia (bone mineral density T score \\x962.5 to \\x961 SD) because they form the largest segment of the community.18\\xa0Likewise, most fractures attributable to nutritional inadequacy arise among the great many people with intakes of calcium and protein that are below recommended levels.19\\xa0This nutritional inadequacy confers a small attributable risk to the individual but accounts for a large attributable fraction of the fracture burden in the community as a whole. This is the Geoffrey Rose prevention paradox\\x97a community based approach producing a small benefit to an individual may still confer a large benefit to the community.17\\xa0Safety is essential because most individuals treated may derive little or no benefit from the intervention. For example, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension study reduced blood pressure by replacing a \\x93western\\x94 diet with a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, and low fat dairy foods\\x97an approach associated with fewer cardiovascular events.20\\nComparison with other studies\\nMost nutrition based studies assessing antifracture efficacy in aged care residents and people in the community used pharmacological doses of calcium with or without vitamin D.21\\xa0In a meta-analysis of 17 of these studies, only two studies reported a reduction in fracture risk\\x97a study of nursing home residents with calcium intakes <600 mg/day and vitamin D concentrations <50 nmol/L and a community based study in women and men ?65 years of age with mean calcium intakes of 700 mg/day.21\\xa0In the remaining 15 studies, poor compliance, large numbers of dropouts, and a low prevalence of the risk factor may have contributed to the null findings.2223\\xa0Benefits are unlikely if the prevalence of a risk factor (such as inadequate calcium and protein intakes) is low.24\\xa0For example, in the meta-analysis, reduction in fracture risk reported with treatment was confined to the 7272 individuals with calcium intakes <700 mg/day (risk ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.89), not the 45?241 individuals with calcium intakes above 700 mg daily.21\\xa0The reduction in fracture risk observed with calcium and protein rich foods in this study may have been the result of attention to several of the above factors. Compliance was optimised by supervised provision and consumption of the foods. Participants lost to follow-up were replaced by newly admitted residents. We intentionally targeted a cohort at high risk for fracture in whom low calcium and protein intakes were common and so were likely to partly contribute to the already high fracture burden in this community.\\nMechanisms of fracture risk reduction\\nThis nutritional intervention produced two unanticipated novel observations. The risk reduction for falls and fractures was detected by three and five months, respectively, and the relative risk reduction for fractures was similar to that found in trials using potent antiresorptive therapy to treat people at high risk due to osteoporosis. The two most likely explanations for each of these observations is a risk reduction for falls and slowing progression of bone fragility. Insulin-like growth factor 1 increased in the intervention group only, whereas the decrease in appendicular lean mass was confined to controls, consistent with the notion that protein intakes of 1-1.5 g/kg/day is needed to prevent protein catabolism and preserve or increase muscle mass in older adults, particularly those at risk of malnutrition or frailty.25\\xa0The increase in serum C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and deterioration in tibial and radial total volumetric bone mineral density in controls was not seen in the intervention group, consistent with slowing of bone loss and slowing of microstructural deterioration.26\\xa0These changes were modest, but slowing microstructural deterioration disproportionately reduces progression of bone fragility because fragility increases as a power function to the bone loss producing it.27\\nMortality did not differ between the groups. Some, but not all, studies suggest that milk consumption is associated with increased mortality but consumption of yoghurt and cheese (fermented foods) with reduced mortality and favourable blood lipid profiles.282930\\xa0Fermented and non-fermented dairy foods were used during the intervention. Milk consumption did not differ between the intervention and control groups (data not shown).\\n',\n",

The study also found no group difference in all-cause mortality. The study's findings suggest that nutritional inadequacy in the intake of calcium and protein may account for a large fraction of the fracture burden in the community as a whole. The participants in the study were at high risk for fracture, and low calcium and protein intakes were common.\"}},\n",

This is especially relevant for sports enthusiasts who want to maintain their physical health and avoid injuries. The study showed that many people have inadequate calcium and protein intake, which increases their risk of fractures. By incorporating high calcium and protein foods into their diet, sports enthusiasts can reduce their risk of fractures and falls, and maintain their active lifestyle.',\n",
       "     'preceding summary': 'Calcium and protein-rich diet reduces risk of hip fractures and falls in older adults\\n\\nA study found that a nutritional approach using high calcium and high protein dairy foods to increase calcium and protein intakes in institutionalized older adults replete in vitamin D was associated with a 33% reduction in risk of fractures of any type, a 46% reduction in risk of hip fractures, and an 11% reduction in risk of falls relative to controls. The population burden of fractures arises from the great many people with intakes of calcium and protein that are below recommended levels. This nutritional inadequacy confers a small attributable risk to the individual but accounts for a large attributable fraction of the fracture burden in the community as a whole. These findings suggest that a dietary approach to reducing fracture risk could have a significant impact on the community.'}}}},\n",

       "      <td>Weight stigma can negatively impact health behaviors, regardless of body mass index (BMI), according to a recent study published in the International Journal of Obesity. The study found that weight stigma was linked to disordered eating, comfort eating, alcohol use, and sleep disturbance, but not physical activity. Interestingly, individuals across the weight spectrum reported experiencing weight stigma. This study highlights the potential barriers that weight stigma can create for healthy behaviors, and suggests that reducing weight stigma could be a strategy to improve population health. This information is relevant for sports enthusiasts who may be interested in understanding how weight stigma can impact their overall health and well-being.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Weight stigma, or discrimination based on a person's weight, can negatively impact health behaviors, according to a recent study. The study found that weight stigma was linked to disordered eating, comfort eating, alcohol use, and sleep disturbance, regardless of BMI. Interestingly, there was no relationship found between weight stigma and physical activity. These findings suggest that weight stigma may be a barrier to healthy behaviors, and that weight-inclusive approaches to health promotion may be more effective.

This is especially relevant for sports enthusiasts who want to maintain their physical health and avoid injuries. The study showed that many people have inadequate calcium and protein intake, which increases their risk of fractures. By incorporating high calcium and protein foods into their diet, sports enthusiasts can reduce their risk of fractures and falls, and maintain their active lifestyle.  \n",
       "2                 Weight stigma can negatively impact health behaviors, regardless of body mass index (BMI), according to a recent study published in the International Journal of Obesity. The study found that weight stigma was linked to disordered eating, comfort eating, alcohol use, and sleep disturbance, but not physical activity. Interestingly, individuals across the weight spectrum reported experiencing weight stigma. This study highlights the potential barriers that weight stigma can create for healthy behaviors, and suggests that reducing weight stigma could be a strategy to improve population health. This information is relevant for sports enthusiasts who may be interested in understanding how weight stigma can impact their overall health and well-being.  \n",
       "3  Weight stigma, or discrimination based on a person's weight, can negatively impact health behaviors, according to a recent study. The study found that weight stigma was linked to disordered eating, comfort eating, alcohol use, and sleep disturbance, regardless of BMI. Interestingly, there was no relationship found between weight stigma and physical activity. These findings suggest that weight stigma may be a barrier to healthy behaviors, and that weight-inclusive approaches to health promotion may be more effective. This study was conducted with a large, national census-matched sample of U.S. adults. As a sports enthusiast, understanding the impact of weight stigma on health behaviors can help you make informed decisions about your own health and well-being.  "

The intervention used high calcium and high protein dairy foods, which resulted in a 33% reduction in fracture risk, a 46% reduction in hip fracture risk, and an 11% reduction in fall risk compared to controls. This approach is particularly relevant for seniors who are at high risk for fractures and have low calcium and protein intake. The increase in protein intake may also help prevent protein breakdown and preserve or increase muscle mass in older adults.

The intervention used high calcium and high protein dairy foods, which were provided and consumed under supervision to ensure compliance. The study targeted a cohort at high risk for fractures and low calcium and protein intake. The risk reduction for falls and fractures was detected by three and five months, respectively. This approach may be particularly relevant for seniors who are at a higher risk of falls and fractures.

This research is relevant to seniors as it provides a natural and effective way to prevent fractures and falls, which are common and dangerous for older adults. The study found that this approach reduced the risk of fractures by 33% and hip fractures by 46%, as well as reducing the risk of falls by 11%. This community-based approach can benefit the population as a whole, not just those at high risk of fractures.

The study, which used a large, national census-matched sample of US adults, found that weight stigma was prevalent across the weight spectrum, including among seniors. The research suggests that weight stigma may be a potential barrier to healthy behaviors, indicating that reducing weight stigma could be a strategy to improve population health. The study also found that targeting health behaviors to achieve weight loss may not be effective, as weight stigma is associated with poorer health behaviors independent of BMI.

We found no group difference in all cause mortality.\\nMost interventions aimed at reducing fracture risk target a drug therapy to people with osteoporosis because they are at high risk of fracture. This approach confers a large benefit to the individual and does so cost effectively, because few people need to be treated to avert one event. However, averting fractures in small numbers of people at high risk does not reduce the burden of fractures in the community.\\nThe population burden of fractures\\x97the number of events, morbidity, mortality, and cost to the community\\x97arises from the vast numbers of people with risk factors that confer a modest attributable risk to the individual.17\\xa0For example, most fragility fractures in the community arise among women with osteopenia (bone mineral density T score \\x962.5 to \\x961 SD) because they form the largest segment of the community.18\\xa0Likewise, most fractures attributable to nutritional inadequacy arise among the great many people with intakes of calcium and protein that are below recommended levels.19\\xa0This nutritional inadequacy confers a small attributable risk to the individual but accounts for a large attributable fraction of the fracture burden in the community as a whole. This is the Geoffrey Rose prevention paradox\\x97a community based approach producing a small benefit to an individual may still confer a large benefit to the community.17\\xa0Safety is essential because most individuals treated may derive little or no benefit from the intervention. For example, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension study reduced blood pressure by replacing a \\x93western\\x94 diet with a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, and low fat dairy foods\\x97an approach associated with fewer cardiovascular events.20\\nComparison with other studies\\nMost nutrition based studies assessing antifracture efficacy in aged care residents and people in the community used pharmacological doses of calcium with or without vitamin D.21\\xa0In a meta-analysis of 17 of these studies, only two studies reported a reduction in fracture risk\\x97a study of nursing home residents with calcium intakes <600 mg/day and vitamin D concentrations <50 nmol/L and a community based study in women and men ?65 years of age with mean calcium intakes of 700 mg/day.21\\xa0In the remaining 15 studies, poor compliance, large numbers of dropouts, and a low prevalence of the risk factor may have contributed to the null findings.2223\\xa0Benefits are unlikely if the prevalence of a risk factor (such as inadequate calcium and protein intakes) is low.24\\xa0For example, in the meta-analysis, reduction in fracture risk reported with treatment was confined to the 7272 individuals with calcium intakes <700 mg/day (risk ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.89), not the 45?241 individuals with calcium intakes above 700 mg daily.21\\xa0The reduction in fracture risk observed with calcium and protein rich foods in this study may have been the result of attention to several of the above factors. Compliance was optimised by supervised provision and consumption of the foods. Participants lost to follow-up were replaced by newly admitted residents. We intentionally targeted a cohort at high risk for fracture in whom low calcium and protein intakes were common and so were likely to partly contribute to the already high fracture burden in this community.\\nMechanisms of fracture risk reduction\\nThis nutritional intervention produced two unanticipated novel observations. The risk reduction for falls and fractures was detected by three and five months, respectively, and the relative risk reduction for fractures was similar to that found in trials using potent antiresorptive therapy to treat people at high risk due to osteoporosis. The two most likely explanations for each of these observations is a risk reduction for falls and slowing progression of bone fragility. Insulin-like growth factor 1 increased in the intervention group only, whereas the decrease in appendicular lean mass was confined to controls, consistent with the notion that protein intakes of 1-1.5 g/kg/day is needed to prevent protein catabolism and preserve or increase muscle mass in older adults, particularly those at risk of malnutrition or frailty.25\\xa0The increase in serum C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and deterioration in tibial and radial total volumetric bone mineral density in controls was not seen in the intervention group, consistent with slowing of bone loss and slowing of microstructural deterioration.26\\xa0These changes were modest, but slowing microstructural deterioration disproportionately reduces progression of bone fragility because fragility increases as a power function to the bone loss producing it.27\\nMortality did not differ between the groups. Some, but not all, studies suggest that milk consumption is associated with increased mortality but consumption of yoghurt and cheese (fermented foods) with reduced mortality and favourable blood lipid profiles.282930\\xa0Fermented and non-fermented dairy foods were used during the intervention. Milk consumption did not differ between the intervention and control groups (data not shown).\\n',\n",
