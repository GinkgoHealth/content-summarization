       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objectives</strong> To systematically synthesise the results of primary qualitative studies on how community-dwelling older adults experience shared decision-making processes, express preferences and actively participate in care.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> Systematic review of qualitative studies and qualitative meta-synthesis.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Methods</strong> We focused on studies about community-dwelling participants aged ≥65 undergoing a health-disease process circumscribed to a primary healthcare setting, and the central theme should focus on either shared decision-making, expressing preferences or patient participation. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus and PsycINFO (time publication frame 2012–2022). We excluded studies in those cases where the qualitative results were not analysed or unrelated to the phenomenon addressed, phenomena were not clear enough to be included or the setting did not occur in the community.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Results</strong> A total of 12 studies were included in this meta-synthesis. We appraised the quality of the selected studies through Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) Checklist. The metasummary comprised the frequency and intensity of qualitative patterns across the included studies. The meta-synthesis revealed four influential elements in their interaction: recognising personal qualities, facing professional characteristics, experiences of discrimination and a double-edged context.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> The phenomena studied were influenced by how older people approached their role in their binomial relationship with healthcare professionals. Those with a reinforced self-concept were better aware of health-disease-related situations regarding shared decision-making and the importance of being communicatively assertive. Professional characteristics were also crucial in how older people modulated their acting ability through their personality, communication skills and the approach healthcare professionals used towards older adults. Situations of discrimination generated through an imbalance of power inhibited the expression of preferences and hindered the active participation of older people. The context surrounding the participants influenced all these situations, key in tipping the balance between a therapeutic and a harmful side.</p>\n",

       "<h2 class=\"\">Introduction</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-12\">In the <em>World report on ageing and health</em>, the WHO stated that older people are expected to have a high use of health services due to the impact of multimorbidity on their abilities.<a id=\"xref-ref-1-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-1\">1</a> Following this statement, those health systems that care for older adults by taking their needs into account do so more effectively than those that only consider specific diseases separately as a reference in their care. Respecting older adults' autonomy and control, privacy, communication and identity is a way of meeting their dignity needs.<a id=\"xref-ref-2-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-2\">2 3</a> Therefore, ensuring processes that manage effective and dignified primary care for older people seems crucial. However, unlike other population groups, these processes are often blurred in pursuit of an ageist conception through which older adults are considered people who, by definition, are incapable or cannot manage their care.<a id=\"xref-ref-4-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-4\">4–6</a> This ageism undermines care based on respect and inhibits the active involvement of older adults.<a id=\"xref-ref-7-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-7\">7</a> Within those effective and dignified processes that could represent a solution against ageism are shared decision-making, expressing preferences about care and engaging in active participation.<a id=\"xref-ref-8-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-8\">8–10</a></p>\n",
       "<h3>Shared decision-making: a kind of controversial performance</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-13\">Regarding the first of them, we understand shared decision-making as a process based on choice, option and decision talk, whose steps are: (1) introduce the choice, (2) describe options and (3) help the patient explore their preferences and make decisions.<a id=\"xref-ref-11-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-11\">11 12</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-14\">These shared decisions can occur in a wide range of possibilities, from those dealing with clinical issues to others choosing to stay at home.<a id=\"xref-ref-13-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-13\">13</a> However, this concept remains controversial today because older patients often need more confidence to decide. This is hindered by insufficient or poor-quality information, adding to the issue that there are times when healthcare professionals do not include older people in the decision-making process.<a id=\"xref-ref-14-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-14\">14</a> Therefore, robust communication between healthcare professionals and the older patient and cohesive teamwork that creates an environment of security and trust are needed for this process to occur authentically and therapeutically.<a id=\"xref-ref-15-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-15\">15</a></p>\n",
       "<h3>Expressing preferences=boosting autonomy</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-15\">Incorporating patient preferences when designing or organising treatments is beneficial, according to Swift <em>et al</em>.<a id=\"xref-ref-16-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-16\">16</a> Similarly, fleeing from a merely positivist plane, listening to and introducing the preferences of patients into the modus operandi of healthcare professionals not only personalises medical treatment and nursing care but also validates and reinforces the self-concept of the older person, in addition to giving them a role of active agency, facilitating emotional relief and supporting their autonomy.<a id=\"xref-ref-17-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-17\">17 18</a> This process is connected to the previous one of shared decision-making because when older patients decide freely, they have previously done so based on a preference.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Active participation: a meeting point</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-16\">Knowledge of the preferences of older patients and their tailoring in the decision-making process is crucial to stimulate active participation.<a id=\"xref-ref-19-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-19\">19 20</a> This active participation is considered one of the critical features for health intervention in older people to be effective, potentially alleviating even negative sensations derived from managing situations of illness.<a id=\"xref-ref-21-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-21\">21</a> The patient’s participation in a health environment refers to actively collaborating in the care process with the health professional. This contribution can be performed by asking questions, expressing concerns or expressing preferences.<a id=\"xref-ref-22-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-22\">22</a> The patient’s active participation is also considered part of patient-centred care and a requirement to conduct shared decision-making.<a id=\"xref-ref-23-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-23\">23</a></p>\n",
       "<h3>Integrating shared decision-making, expressing preferences and active participation of older adults in primary care nursing</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-17\">As the evidence has shown, these three processes are closely related and can even be interpreted as dependent on each other: to reach shared decision-making, it becomes necessary to express preferences and, in turn, deciding is already participating in some process. Integrating these phenomena can capture a deeper understanding of, on the one hand, how they inter-relate and what shapes them in the case of older adults.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-18\">On the other hand, this discovery would reveal which communicative elements become essential in the health-disease process of older adults, thus helping to adapt specific decision-making approaches in primary care situations.<a id=\"xref-ref-24-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-24\">24</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-19\">The term health-disease process refers to the sociocultural construction through which the individual experiences the moment of illness as a temporary transit that influences roles, expectations, representations and health behaviours uniquely and dynamically.<a id=\"xref-ref-25-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-25\">25</a> Thus, realising this study would also help develop specific approaches to handle this construct by identifying the determinants and elements that condition these experiences.<a id=\"xref-ref-26-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-26\">26</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-20\">In this way, addressing shared decision-making, expressing preferences and active participation in community-dwelling older adults, from the integrating approach of a qualitative meta-synthesis, may result in a new contribution to how a relationship based on respect and dignity of older adults emerge, contributing to avoiding ageist attitudes still present on the part of healthcare professionals.<a id=\"xref-ref-27-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-27\">27 28</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-21\">Finally, considering the roadmap set by the WHO’s report for the Decade of Healthy Ageing 2021–2030,<a id=\"xref-ref-29-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-29\">29</a> the purpose of the present qualitative synthesis was to systematically synthesise the results of primary qualitative studies on how community-dwelling older adults experience shared decision-making processes, express preferences and actively participate in care. In addition, we aim to synthesise what elements shape their appearance, inter-relation and how they condition the healthcare professional–older patient relationships.</p>\n",
       "<h2 class=\"\">Methods</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Design</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-22\">Sandelowski and Barroso define qualitative research synthesis as a process and a product of scientific inquiry whose purpose is to systematically review and formally integrate the findings from completed qualitative studies.<a id=\"xref-ref-30-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30</a> Within qualitative research synthesis, there are a variety of methodological approaches.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-23\">First, we performed a meta-summary of effect sizes approach. We did this to obtain an empirical foundation for a subsequent qualitative meta-synthesis since we handled a collection of qualitative studies to determine the frequency and intensity of qualitative patterns intrastudy and across studies.<a id=\"xref-ref-30-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30 31</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-24\">Second, and once we fulfilled the meta-summary of effect sizes, we conducted a qualitative meta-synthesis approach, since we analysed qualitative data across the selected studies, thus appraising, summarising and combining qualitative evidence to address the research question and, therefore, offering a novel interpretation of how shared decision-making, expressing preferences and active participation relate in the health-disease process of community-dwelling older adults.<a id=\"xref-ref-30-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30 31</a> To address the part corresponding to the meta-synthesis, we approached Noblit and Hare’s meta-ethnography<a id=\"xref-ref-32-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32</a> since it implies an interpretation similar to the qualitative methods of the studies we intended to synthesise. To do this, we adopted their main feature of reciprocal translation.<a id=\"xref-ref-32-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32</a> This synthesising technique aims to retain the particularity of the primary results even when they are synthesised and treat the original interpretations and explanations as data being translated across several studies to produce a synthesis.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-25\">We then share the notion about the qualitative meta-synthesis as something more than the sum of its parts, going beyond the primary interpretations from the selected studies, thus developing new contributions. This applies to our goal to synthesise and deliver a new interpretation of how the moment of shared decision-making appears in older patients in a community setting, how this is interrelated with expressing their preferences, and how it could be translated to patient participation. In addition, we maintained an explicit focus on contrasting and determining the elements that shaped the course of the study phenomenon.<a id=\"xref-ref-33-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-33\">33</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-26\">Besides, we performed a systematic review of qualitative literature, which required an exhaustive approach to searching and appraising selected qualitative studies.<a id=\"xref-ref-34-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-34\">34</a> This is consistent with how Sandelowski and Barroso also understand the search process of qualitative studies.<a id=\"xref-ref-35-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-35\">35</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-27\">The structure of this study is based on the six steps that Sandelowski and Barroso indicate to perform the meta-synthesis:<a id=\"xref-ref-35-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-35\">35</a> (1) conceiving the synthesis, (2) searching and retrieving literature, (3) appraising findings, (4) classifying findings, (5) synthesising findings into metasummaries and (6) synthesising findings into a meta-synthesis.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-28\">This meta-synthesis was prepared following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement<a id=\"xref-ref-36-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-36\">36</a> (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-1\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental table 1</a>) and the Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research Statement.<a id=\"xref-ref-37-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-37\">37</a> In the same way, this meta-synthesis was registered in the International Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) with ID CRD42022363515.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"\">Supplemental material</h3>\n",
       "<h3>Conceiving the synthesis</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-30\">A reflection period was initiated before posing the research questions, which, throughout the meta-synthesis, would account for its circular and flexible nature.<a id=\"xref-ref-38-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-38\">38</a> This period was marked by the following moments: (1) defining the key concepts around which the qualitative synthesis should revolve, (2) deciding the perspective that will be adopted to address the phenomenon under study and (3) making sure of the challenge of establishing adequate methodological and theoretical bases for a meta-synthesis.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-31\">The research questions were:</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-32\">How do shared decision-making moments appear in community-dwelling older patients?</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-33\">How is this inter-related with expressing their preferences?</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-34\">How could it be translated to patient participation?</p>\n",
       "<h3>Searching and retrieving literature</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-35\">The qualitative studies to be included had to meet the following inclusion criteria to elucidate the focus of the meta-synthesis:</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-36\">Participants aged ≥65, or median age ≥65 if mixed population (excluded if &gt;25% of participants aged &lt;60).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-37\">Participants were patients who were undergoing a health-disease process (acute or chronic).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-38\">Participants were clients of/interacted with primary healthcare services.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-39\">Original research studies conducted using qualitative methodology.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-40\">The central theme of the research was (Given that these three elements are closely related, as formerly stated, the research team considered addressing them separately to meet the first of the objectives of this meta-synthesis, which is to synthesise them providing a new joint interpretation.):</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-41\">Shared decision-making,</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-42\">OR</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-43\">Patient preferences,</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-44\">OR</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-45\">Patient participation.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-46\">The exclusion criteria were as follows:</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-47\">Qualitative results of primary studies were not analysed or not related to the phenomenon addressed.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-48\">Phenomena were not clear enough to be included.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-49\">The setting did not take place in the community.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-50\">Seriously ill /end-of-life older participants.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-51\">We selected five databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus and PsycINFO). PubMed for being one of the largest databases in the field of health sciences; CINAHL, for being one of the essential nursing databases; Web of Science, for its grand scope and number of indexed articles; Scopus and PsycINFO, for their great value in the psychosocial and psychological sphere, which encompasses a series of necessary nuances in shared decision-making, patient preferences and patient participation. We decided to use pertinent database filters further to ensure a thorough practice in the literature search, thus helping to avoid the threat of failing to achieve sufficient strengthened informative insights in this study.<a id=\"xref-ref-30-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30</a> The filters used in the databases are the following: (1) the last 10 years because more than 80% of the studies found were performed from the year 2012, (2) nursing, to circumscribe the study phenomena to the discipline of nursing, (3) exclude MEDLINE records, in those databases other than PubMed, and that had it available to eliminate duplicates and (4) English/Spanish because they are the languages that the research team mastered. Both the filters applied and the search terms were adapted to the configuration of each database. We performed a comprehensive search strategy; its results are in the <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-2-1\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC2\">online supplemental table 2</a>.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"\">Supplemental material</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-53\">PM-A searched MEDLINE and CINAHL on 9 September, Web of Science and PsycINFO on 13 September and Scopus on 15 and 16 September 2022. Finally, all databases were searched on 22 September. This process was supported and followed by MR-R, as we explain next. At the beginning of the article screening phase, consensus meetings were held to agree on each step that would be carried out. We decided to use EndNote for screening. PM-A performed all screening stages, applied the eligibility criteria mentioned above and selected studies through a detailed review of the title, abstract and full text for their inclusion. About 10% of the selected articles were chosen randomly and sent to MR-R for evaluation and to obtain feedback and check decisions made. Both authors read and reviewed all potentially relevant articles after that. All the research team agreed with the decisions and steps. Finally, 12 studies were selected for their inclusion (<a id=\"xref-fig-1-1\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F1\">figure 1</a>).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-54\" class=\"first-child\">Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 statement flow diagram.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Appraising reports</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-55\">After selecting the final reports, we performed an individual and a group appraisal. It consisted of, on the one hand, reading individually as many times as necessary to identify specific content and, on the other, comparing the studies collectively through a group meeting to address differences and similarities to establish a relationship between them and create summaries, adding to develop a consensus between the content found by the authors.<a id=\"xref-ref-30-5\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-56\">We applied to the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP), a checklist focusing on qualitative studies’ findings, validity and usefulness. The main strength of the CASP checklist resides in promoting a systematic approach by which the advantages and disadvantages of a study may be identified.<a id=\"xref-ref-39-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-39\">39</a> PM-A and MRR followed the checklist grid to evaluate the 12 chosen articles. After that, they shared the results. We understood this step as more than simply scoring or fixing anything because it helps to better understand the selected studies before embarking on the findings.<a id=\"xref-ref-35-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-35\">35</a></p>\n",
       "<h3>Classifying findings</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-57\">We considered the older participants of each selected study as the first-order generators of knowledge. Later, the authors of each study would be the second-order generators of knowledge by giving the first interpretations. Finally, we occupied the third position by providing a new interpretation of the knowledge generated by the first two. For this reason, this meta-synthesis could be understood as three different levels where we are the third interpreters of the first two.<a id=\"xref-ref-30-6\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30 35</a> We decided then to prioritise the life experiences of the first-order generators of knowledge. However, we did not completely rule out the interpretations of the second-order generators of knowledge because they served us as referential adequacy for the new interpretation of our study.<a id=\"xref-ref-40-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-40\">40</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-58\">We emphasised the content of the data sources when classifying the findings, but first, the research team met to reach a consensus to decide what would be considered data to include. Our final decision was to contemplate data as the quotes of the older patients (first-order generators of knowledge), considering the primary researchers' interpretations and abstractions (second-order generators of knowledge). All the data classified came from the results section of the selected studies. Considering this, we understood that our choice corresponded with data-based findings.<a id=\"xref-ref-30-7\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30</a> Data-based findings are compositions built through the analysis of extracts from interviews, observations or documents by the second-order generators of knowledge in primary qualitative studies.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-59\">Finally, we created an extraction rubric for the occasion to approach the findings of the selected primary studies uniformly and thus systematically extract the data for subsequent analysis. PM-A examined all those sets of potential findings to be included in our meta-synthesis to be extracted and MR-R supervised decisions made by the first. Only the findings that answered ‘Yes’ in all the items were integrated for the next phase.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-60\">The items that made up the rubric were the following:</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-61\">The finding is closely related to shared decision-making/expressing preferences/active participation (Yes/No).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-62\">The finding comes directly from the first-order generators of knowledge (Yes/No).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-63\">The finding was analysed by the second-order generators of knowledge (Yes/No).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-64\">The finding held a profound qualitative meaning which could contribute to the meta-synthesis (Yes/No).</p>\n",
       "<h3>Analysis: synthesising findings into metasummary and meta-synthesis</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-65\">The analysis phase results were managed and processed using the QSR NVivo V.12 computer software tool.<a id=\"xref-ref-41-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-41\">41</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-66\">The qualitative metasummary of effect sizes is a quantitatively oriented aggregation of qualitative findings, whose objective is to discover the frequency and intensity with which the findings are distributed within each study and across all of them.<a id=\"xref-ref-42-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-42\">42</a> In this way, performing a metasummary allowed us to identify selected studies’ patterns and strengthen informative insights.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-67\">We did not consider the qualitative metasummary as an end, but as a bridge we crossed to build the meta-synthesis. Relying on the information obtained through the metasummary, we had as a reference the selected studies’ patterns to create a new interpretation based on the new qualitative patterns synthesised in our work, thus answering the research questions we posed.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-68\">For the metasummary, we also calculated the magnitude of the effect sizes. Effect sizes address the frequency of occurrence of an experience sufficient to constitute a pattern, facilitating a further understanding of the studied phenomenon and an overview of how patterns of meaning are distributed across studies.<a id=\"xref-ref-42-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-42\">42 43</a> We calculated interstudy frequency effect size by taking the number of individual studies that contain a specific finding and dividing it by the number of total studies in the sample. In this way, we found the representation of subthemes across studies. We calculated intrastudy intensity effect size by taking the number of studies containing at least one category belonging to each subtheme, divided by the number of total sub-themes. Following this, we found the concentration of findings of each selected study.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-69\">The meta-synthesis is an interpretive integration of qualitative findings in primary research studies through interpretive data syntheses.<a id=\"xref-ref-30-8\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30</a> To achieve this, PM-A individually performed analysis through the phenomenological–hermeneutical considerations proposed by Ricoeur<a id=\"xref-ref-44-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-44\">44</a> and was supported by PEV-P and SL-Q.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-70\">In the preliminary analysis phase, the authors superficially read the included studies, obtaining a general meaning and writing a list of ideas to guide the analysis until reaching a raw explanation of the phenomenon studied.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-71\">At the first level of analysis (explanation), we selected nodes or whole units of meaning. The nodes or whole units of meaning were interpretative fragments of the first-order generators of knowledge that contained a basic meaning, an explanation and a justification of that meaning. We established a round-trip process between the nodes and the starting categories to ensure that the interpretative thread remained linked to the participants’ life experiences. We considered as starting categories the interpretations and abstractions that the second-order generators of knowledge made of the first ones. After reviewing the nodes created and the studies selected, we ensured that every unit of meaning was noticed.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-72\">At the second level (naive comprehension), the nodes were organised according to these new categories. Once contained in them, they were regrouped by the affinity of meanings, creating codes capable of reaching greater abstraction.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-73\">At the third level (in-depth understanding), we reached a greater understanding of the phenomenon through the hermeneutic arc. The hermeneutic arch is considered the achievement of a back-and-forth process that combines the preliminary understanding of the analysed phenomenon and the final interpretations of the data corpus, reaching the highest level of abstraction of meanings with the creation of study patterns, subthemes and categories.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Patient and public involvement</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-74\">Patients and/or the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, or reporting or dissemination plans of this research.</p>\n",
       "<h2 class=\"\">Results</h2>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-79\" class=\"first-child\">Meta-synthesis. Relationship between the four dimensions.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-80\">According to CASP, the selected studies’ scores were the following: 70% for one article, 75% for three articles, 80% for three articles, 85% for three articles, 90% for one article and 95% for one article (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-6-1\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC6\">online supplemental table 6</a>). Although all studies scored 70% or higher, no investigation would have been excluded based solely on possible poor quality.<a id=\"xref-ref-30-9\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30</a> The reviewers involved in the process agreed on all article criteria and scores.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"\">Supplemental material</h3>\n",
       "<h3>Metasummary</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-82\">The present study’s effect size metasummary comprised the interstudy frequency effect size and intrastudy intensity effect size (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-3-2\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC3\">online supplemental table 3</a>).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-83\">Regarding the interstudy frequency effect size, within each subtheme, the most prominent categories were the self-perception of the older person, the approach of the health professional, the discrimination perceived in certain situations by the older person, and the importance of feeling safe. Likewise, regarding the intrastudy intensity effect size, the subthemes had an effect size of 92%, meaning that 11 out of the 12 studies contributed categories representing each. The authors want to state that no subtheme was considered over or under-represented because all of them arose with strength beyond their frequency in the testimonies of the older people involved.<a id=\"xref-ref-30-10\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30</a></p>\n",
       "<h3>Meta-synthesis</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-84\">The end of the synthesising approach to reciprocal translation gave rise to an abstract integration of findings in the community-dwelling older adults’ reports in the form of an ‘imbalance of power relations’. This imbalance of power relations in shared decision-making, expression of preferences and active participation among older people in the community revealed two influential pillars in their interaction: the older person-healthcare professionals’ binomial and a doubled-edged context. In turn, a third pillar fluctuates based on how power relations develop between the first two, the latter being situations of discrimination suffered by older people. The experiences that delivered this synthesis were assembled into four subthemes: recognising personal qualities, facing professional characteristics, experiences of discrimination, and double-edged context (<a id=\"xref-fig-2-2\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F2\">figure 2</a>).</p>\n",
       "<h3>Recognising personal qualities</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-85\">Recognising personal qualities pertains to the capacity of older people to assume those interiorised values, attitudes, beliefs and qualities. This assumption acts: (1) as an initiator of an active intention to embark on their health-disease process, leading them to have an empowered agency to decide or, at least, take part in some way in the decisions that are made around their state of health or (2) hindering that intention, attending to a kind of self-sabotage regarding enjoying opportunities that allow them to decide, express their preferences or participate.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-86\">Considering the first of the two conceptions presented in the previous paragraph, the qualities facilitated personal characteristics in achieving truly centred care for the older patient.<a id=\"xref-ref-45-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-45\">45</a> These characteristics play a vital role in older people as an anchoring point for displaying concepts they identify as a bridge between the active-attitude <em>self</em> and the active-agency <em>self</em>. That bridge is built based on inner strength, positive attitudes and a sense of humour: ‘I have been an active woman my entire life, so I decided that I should learn to walk again! I followed a training programme every day; eventually, I made it’ (Nilsen <em>et al</em>, p575).<a id=\"xref-ref-45-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-45\">45</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-87\">As older people crossed that bridge, they realised that effective and shared decision-making is a true reflection of having autonomy in the process, which, added to the performance of that autonomy, creates participation that leads to a feeling of responsibility. Therefore, being responsible for their health increases self-identity, self-esteem and confidence in older people, which is closely reflected in the execution of shared decision-making.<a id=\"xref-ref-46-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-46\">46</a> All of this generates a sense of control and power in older adults. This sense occurs because they also protect empowerment by safeguarding the autonomy-decision-making binomial. In this situation, they expressed their preferences autonomously and powerfully: ‘I think it’s a control issue with me…I manage my medical care and everything else in my life and I keep [my children] in the loop after it’s done’ (Crotty <em>et al</em>, p1495).<a id=\"xref-ref-47-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-47\">47</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-88\">The consequences of feeling responsible also affect active participation, which, in turn, is fed back with the self-perception of that active role in their care, which increases the satisfaction that once again increases their desire to participate in a kind of therapeutic circle.<a id=\"xref-ref-8-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-8\">8 48</a> This desire to participate was also considered a willingness to be fully informed and that this information should be based on evidence. In this way, older people declared that being fully informed is being prepared to face any process.<a id=\"xref-ref-45-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-45\">45 49</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-89\">Older people reported that being active in their daily lives and carrying out activities is also a way of making decisions, maintaining their coping skills and attending to their spiritual sphere.<a id=\"xref-ref-45-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-45\">45 46</a> Therefore, they highlighted having that self-perception of their needs and communicative assertiveness to express their preferences in managing their care: ‘You have to be assertive. I don't feel that I have to be overly assertive, because my doctor responds to my feelings. But it’s important to be assertive’ (Mitchell <em>et al</em>, p6).<a id=\"xref-ref-50-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-50\">50</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-90\">Furthermore, personal qualities can act simultaneously as hindrances. Excessive politeness or stubborn behaviour leading to unrealistic goals interferes with the decision-making process, expression of preferences and therefore active participation, in turn, also interacts with professionals and their characteristics: ‘It is not always easy to give one’s opinion; often a lot should happen before I do so. For instance, I feel it is rude to express my opinion about the nurse whose behavior I do not approve, that would not be appropriate. I guess I should not tell this to you, either, but…’ (Nilsen <em>et al</em>, p575).<a id=\"xref-ref-45-5\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-45\">45</a></p>\n",
       "<h3>Facing professional characteristics</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-91\">Facing professional characteristics pertains to all those requirements constituting healthcare, where numerous elements come together from the point of view of older persons. Professional characteristics were vital to decision-making, expression of preferences, and active participation. Healthcare professionals modulated these characteristics by having the opportunity to create situations to develop older people as active agents in care.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-92\">This relationship must be built from a mutual understanding that makes decision-making a shared act, establishing a personal inter-relationship that allows an individualised approach to care for older adults.<a id=\"xref-ref-49-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-49\">49 51</a> Within this approach, giving a choice was raised as essential to promote patient involvement in decision-making: ‘Certainly my GP [General Practitioner] always makes me decide, you know, “What would you like to do?” Well, I don’t know, and I have sat there and said to him, “I don’t know, what would you suggest?” […] Sometimes I don’t want to know what’s happening for an operation or something you know. He never pushed the line. It was up to you, you had to…He couldn’t make my mind up, but he could advise me, which he did’ (Butterworth and Campbell, p711).<a id=\"xref-ref-48-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-48\">48</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-93\">Regarding expressing preferences, older people appreciated the flexibility and availability of those healthcare professionals who made efforts to listen to their priorities regarding the day and time of home visits or the mere fact of being there when they were needed: ‘Sometimes, I cannot reach the toilet in time. I always have my mobile phone in my pocket, and I call the home care nurses immediately. Then they show up in a short time to help undress me and give me shower. This means a lot to me’ (Nilsen <em>et al</em>, p574)<a id=\"xref-ref-45-6\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-45\">45</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-94\">The personality of the healthcare professionals played an essential role in bringing the older person closer to a <em>real</em> moment of shared decision-making, who highlighted honesty, kindness, understanding and respect as critical qualities.<a id=\"xref-ref-45-7\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-45\">45 49</a> In short, older people positively valued those professionals who treated them not as someone who depended on their clinical judgement but as ‘equals’: ‘I feel more as an equal than I ever used to, and that helps me to have a sensible, constructive conversation with him. I think being asked to contribute treats you as a person with your own views and the ability to make that decision for yourself […] but also to realise that I use them to help me with my health care’ (Butterworth and Campbell, p713).<a id=\"xref-ref-48-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-48\">48</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-95\">However, to achieve the status of ‘equal’, older people considered it necessary to deal with professionals whose communication skills would encourage them to feel heard and to be actively involved in their care. Hence, communicative and active listening skills promote a communicative relationship centred on the older patient.<a id=\"xref-ref-48-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-48\">48 51 52</a> This added to a less paternalistic attitude on the part of the healthcare professionals, enhanced communication by the preferences of older people: ‘Today we expect an awful lot more out of the health service than when I had my children 40 years ago. But I think one’s attitude changes; you have a better overall view. The more you’re involved, the more you see what a vast and overwhelming organisation it is. You just hope they’re getting it right. […] The sort of hierarchy of the medical profession was very different, wasn't it, and they very much made the decisions for you’ (Butterworth and Campbell, p712)<a id=\"xref-ref-48-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-48\">48</a></p>\n",
       "<h3>Experiences of discrimination</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-96\">Experiences of discrimination pertain to the encounter between certain personal qualities of older adults and characteristics of the healthcare professionals that caused, on certain occasions, situations of discrimination. Thus, an imbalance in their relationship originated ‘illusions’ of moments of agency, perceptions of ageist attitudes and even fear or dread.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-97\">These ‘illusions’ were well exemplified when healthcare professionals made older people see that they could decide when they did not. Older people declared that they felt this delusion when professionals made decisions for them rather than together with them when handling a considerable amount of overly technical information. This gave the older patients the feeling that they could only make a decision when it was explicitly communicated to them.<a id=\"xref-ref-8-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-8\">8 53</a> Communication barriers, sustained by a lack of encouragement to listen to the concerns of older patients or to satisfy their communication needs,<a id=\"xref-ref-50-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-50\">50 54</a> could be overcome if healthcare professionals had given older people a real opportunity to participate by making decisions about their possible illnesses and treatment: ‘No, nobody asked what I felt about being discharged. I did not protest the decision at the time. But, thinking back now, I would like to protest it because I did not feel safe enough at the time’ (Nilsen <em>et al</em>, p574).<a id=\"xref-ref-45-8\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-45\">45</a> This is a dead end where professionals did not show enough transparency. Older people considered them as power figures whom they were not able to question: ‘I don't want to do that [discuss reducing medication] because then I disregard my GP’s advice, my GP expects me to follow her advice’ (van Bussel <em>et al</em>, p4).<a id=\"xref-ref-55-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-55\">55</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-98\">This power imbalance caused older people to fear when they came up with situations in which they ‘challenged’ that authority.<a id=\"xref-ref-53-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-53\">53 55</a> The fear of expressing their preferences due to a possible unwanted consequence and becoming responsible for their own decisions inhibited a balanced and therapeutic relationship: ‘I am not going to be stubborn because if something would happen, it would be my own fault’ (van Bussel <em>et al</em>, p4).<a id=\"xref-ref-55-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-55\">55</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-99\">The circumstances raised the older person’s perception of being treated differently due to several factors, such as age (ageism), ethnic identity, socioeconomic condition, health condition or language.<a id=\"xref-ref-49-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-49\">49 50 53 55</a> For this reason, healthcare professionals showed no confidence in older patients when it came to involving them in the discussion of decisions related to their health<a id=\"xref-ref-49-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-49\">49</a>; older adults were considered as people who, due to ageing, were marked by disease and symptoms, something that prevented professionals from contextualising the older people’s health condition in their life stage: ‘Sometimes I feel that they think you are still a young guy because you have to reach certain [blood pressure] levels, which might not be relevant anymore for older people’ (van Bussel <em>et al</em>, p4).<a id=\"xref-ref-55-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-55\">55</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-100\">On the one hand, the professionals were not transparent when dealing with individual cases because they were not crystal clear about the consequences of the choices that could be made, generating a moment of uncertainty.<a id=\"xref-ref-53-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-53\">53 55</a> On the other hand, this created in older adults a feeling of dependency on the professional, coming to feel objectified, invisible and undervalued; coming to not feel like an active agent of their own care, accepting paternalistic attitudes from the health system.<a id=\"xref-ref-53-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-53\">53–55</a> Such context, which created communication barriers, decreased the participation of older adults: ‘It’s so hard to get them to pay any attention to you. They don’t listen to what you’re saying. ‘You’re an old lady and, tada, tada, tada’—you know?’’ (Bynum <em>et al</em>, p225).<a id=\"xref-ref-8-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-8\">8</a></p>\n",
       "<h3>Double-edged context</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-101\">Double-edged context pertains to a scenario that played a crucial role when calibrating personal qualities and professional characteristics, even going so far as to shape the appearance of discriminatory situations. This scenario gained importance to provide older people with positive tools to reinforce concepts that drove them to decide, express themselves and participate effectively or to deprive them of any potential opportunity to develop on that level. Depending on the older person’s circumstances, everything would indicate therapeutic performance in the healthcare professional–older patient relationship or a frustrated one.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-102\">In these terms, a poor health system organisation had great importance, according to older adults. The overload of work resulted in healthcare professionals always being in a hurry. In addition, there was a lack of longitudinal care; therefore, older people did not feel a continuous personalised approach because, once and again, they were attended to by different professionals each time they used the health system.<a id=\"xref-ref-45-9\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-45\">45 49 50</a> This excessive workload brought significant problems with time available to be optimally attended. The fact that healthcare professionals did not dedicate the time that the older people considered necessary prevented them from having a good conversation, feeling that they lacked the opportunity to ‘open up’, thus interfering in expressing their preferences.<a id=\"xref-ref-45-10\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-45\">45 49 54</a> This situation led older people to feel not like a person but like a number: ‘Some practicing doctors have a tendency to get into a routine of you being a number’ (Mitchell <em>et al</em>, p5).<a id=\"xref-ref-50-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-50\">50</a> Something like this prevented the development of relationships of trust with the professionals that would shed some light on this frustrating reality.<a id=\"xref-ref-51-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-51\">51 54</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-103\">The conducts, behaviours and ideologies have their raison d'être in society and culture, which immediately affected how the relationships between the healthcare professional and the older patient were established. This is something that older people also made explicit through differences in approach depending on the nature of the patients, the way healthcare professionals addressed them and how professionals managed that relationship.<a id=\"xref-ref-48-5\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-48\">48 50 54</a> In line with the way to manage these relationships, management and the importance of information gained prominence, being able to act as a facilitator or hinderer of the context of the relationship with professionals in older people.<a id=\"xref-ref-8-5\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-8\">8 49 54 55</a> The more quality information adapted to the older adult was provided considering the first possibility, the greater the engagement had in their care. Nevertheless, the problems came when the information was inconsistent between professionals, confusing older adults by providing conflicting information: ‘Then I asked for info [about the pneumococcal vaccine] and the practice nurse said it has been around for years but the hospital doctor said it was new’ (Sheridan <em>et al,</em> p37).<a id=\"xref-ref-54-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-54\">54</a> The older people declared in any case that when they came across professionals who did not provide them with enough quality information, it led to an inability to act, which added to a feeling of not being listened to. It gave rise to the older person’s disempowerment: ‘I like to have lots of options in front of me so that I know I can make an informed decision. But I don’t feel like that way when I go to the doctor, I feel dis-empowered’ (Brown <em>et al</em>, p3).<a id=\"xref-ref-49-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-49\">49</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-104\">Something that favoured empowerment in the decision-making process and facilitated assertive communication in the older person was surrounding themselves with a circle of trust or important ones who supported them at decisive moments.<a id=\"xref-ref-47-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-47\">47 50</a> In other words, having social support from family or friends represented a valuable tool for the relationships with healthcare professionals and the use of the health system: ‘My husband is taking care of me and he helps me a lot. Without him, I would need a lot more help from the healthcare services’ (Nilsen <em>et al</em>, p575).<a id=\"xref-ref-45-11\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-45\">45</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-105\">Finally, all these elements could be found in the sense of security that combined receiving help when needed, being duly informed of their rights as clients of the health system, or dealing with professionals and flexible routines in a continuous and non-sporadic manner. The older patients also highlighted the figure of the home care nurse as a link between various levels of healthcare.<a id=\"xref-ref-45-12\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-45\">45</a></p>\n",
       "<h2 class=\"\">Discussion</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-106\">This systematic review of qualitative studies and qualitative meta-synthesis comprises 12 primary qualitative studies. It provides a comprehensive understanding of how the moment of shared decision-making appears in older patients in a community setting, how this is inter-related with expressing their preferences and how it could be translated to patient participation. Our results are consistent with the theory of van Dijk<a id=\"xref-ref-56-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-56\">56</a> of discourse and power because our meta-synthesis reveals that these three study phenomena are affected to a great extent by an (im)balance in the power relations established between the older person and the healthcare professionals. The personal qualities, professional characteristics and the context in which they occur shape the appearance of <em>real</em> situations of decision-making, expressing preferences and active participation; their inter-relation and how they condition to care for the older patient. The reproduction of the participants’ discourse of primary studies suggests that older adults' feelings of frustration and of not being heard in situations sensitive to ageism and abuse of power from the health system and the importance of a context influencing all the above could be highlighted on occasions. The shared decision-making experience, the expression of care preferences and active participation within it are highly complex interweaving that follows communicative, relational, and personal patterns.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Discussion of findings</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-107\">In general terms, older people revealed numerous elements influencing the appearance of <em>real</em> situations of shared decision-making, expressing preferences and active participation. Our results suggest that <em>real</em> shared decision-making situations are not reduced to specific moments or issues. Still, <em>real</em> situations of shared decision-making comprise the perceived feeling by older people as empowered, having control over one particular situation and asserting their autonomy. All this is potentially enhanced by professional characteristics that care providers have and might benefit that feeling perceived by older patients. This is consistent with a recent study by Egan <em>et al</em><a id=\"xref-ref-57-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-57\">57</a> that places primary care nurses as crucial elements in enhancing the performance of older people in decision-making processes. However, as we also reflected in the results of our study, implementing shared decision-making in older people is challenging.<a id=\"xref-ref-58-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-58\">58</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-108\">Sometimes, older people did not commit to shared decision-making due to their way of being or conceiving the relationship with their reference healthcare professional. Those healthcare professionals who did not understand older people, added to a changing context, weighed down potential therapeutic relationships. According to our findings, this represented an interference with the care that could have been perfectly avoidable. This result is supported by other reviews that highlight the inter-relation of elements such as the patient, the patient–healthcare professional relationship, the organisation of the health system or the importance of teamwork in a therapeutic performance that allows engaging and promoting the involvement of the patients.<a id=\"xref-ref-59-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-59\">59–61</a> The interest and ‘desire to do’ become critical elements in the personal qualities of older people that mean a beginning to establish that therapeutic relationship, as reported by Gillespie <em>et al</em>.<a id=\"xref-ref-62-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-62\">62</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-109\">However, as explained throughout the study, personal qualities are not the only factors to consider. Regarding healthcare professionals, the meta-synthesis performed by Clancy <em>et al</em><a id=\"xref-ref-2-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-2\">2</a> determined the importance of establishing positive relationships with older people. This is consistent with our study because older patients appreciated dealing with healthcare professionals who allowed them to express their feelings and preferences. In addition, professional characteristics such as having confidence and the ability to control emotions are critical concepts for a promising approach in the healthcare professional–patient relationship.<a id=\"xref-ref-63-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-63\">63</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-110\">From van Dijk’s theoretical perspective on discourse and power, our study results are consistent with his conception of communication as inequality reproducing element.<a id=\"xref-ref-56-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-56\">56 64</a> It adds to understanding how the phenomena studied are inter-related, degenerating into situations of discrimination when the discourse serves as a vehicle for the dominating elements. This result is consistent with other reviews that displace older people to a passive role on numerous occasions, endangering the balance of power between them and healthcare professionals and highlighting the discourse as a power-holding tool.<a id=\"xref-ref-65-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-65\">65 66</a> This tool can feed the feeling of living in a <em>mirage</em> of opportunities. For older patients, this <em>mirage</em> translates into a lack of opportunities to participate in care, despite feeling motivated, in a kind of imbalance of power between the healthcare professionals and the older patients where communication has an essential role, as Ozavci <em>et al</em><a id=\"xref-ref-67-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-67\">67</a> showed in their systematic review. Ageism situations appear when the characteristics of the disease are confused with a physiological stage, such as the ageing process. These results are consistent with the Stereotype Embodiment Theory, which explains an internalisation of ageism in society, thus unconsciously acquiring stereotypes due to ageist messages that society itself sends through the institutions, in this case, the healthcare system.<a id=\"xref-ref-68-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-68\">68</a> From the perspective of ageism and compared with other reviews about young adults, elements such as communication and information delivery in decision-making are equally important.<a id=\"xref-ref-69-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-69\">69 70</a> However, although similar needs are shared in both populations, older people deal with ageist attitudes on the part of society, as our results have shown, in addition to a scarcity of studies focusing on how to empower older people in transitional decision-making processes.<a id=\"xref-ref-71-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-71\">71</a> For this reason, when healthcare professionals adopt ageist behaviours, they limit the possibility of older people developing and expressing themselves as active agents of change, creating a marginalisation based on these unbalanced power relations.<a id=\"xref-ref-72-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-72\">72</a> In contrast, based on our study, we meet the qualitative synthesis of Strandås and Bondas<a id=\"xref-ref-73-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-73\">73</a> when a more therapeutic nurse–patient relationship has been managed to demonstrate that it promotes communicative openness and a boost to positive sensations; in other words, to share moments of accessibility in care.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-111\">The importance of a context that can be positive or negative for the appearance of <em>real</em> situations of shared decision-making, expression of preferences and active participation in older people has become apparent. The fact that nurses and doctors have little time to care for patients, in addition to an excessive workload, blames a deficient organisation of the health system in a certain way, thus negatively impacting in quality of care and professional performance, being consistent with other reviews.<a id=\"xref-ref-74-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-74\">74 75</a> Furthermore, positive social support in older people facilitates dealing with hostile situations and reinforces their communicative assertiveness, communicating their preferences more frequently.<a id=\"xref-ref-76-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-76\">76 77</a> The feeling of security in this study appeared along with other closely related concepts, such as the importance of receiving adequate and personalised information and the confidence that healthcare professionals knew how to transfer them. Regarding this feeling of safety, older people also stated that the possibility of continuing their recreational or spiritual activities in the community comforted them and prevented feelings of loneliness or isolation, thus consistent with the scoping review conducted by Fakoya <em>et al</em>.<a id=\"xref-ref-78-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-78\">78</a></p>\n",
       "<h3>Strengths and limitations</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-112\">The main strength of the present study is that it represents the first qualitative meta-synthesis that gives greater depth to understanding the phenomena of shared decision-making, the expression of preferences and active participation in community-dwelling older adults, jointly and not separately. The new interpretation offered by this study has highlighted the importance of power relations in triggering situations of ageism regarding the studied phenomena. Thus, our meta-synthesis underlines elements that healthcare professionals could consider incorporating into their daily practice and thus promote a therapeutic relationship of <em>real</em> situations of shared decision-making, expression of preferences and active participation in nursing care. Including studies whose participants had mental conditions could also have enriched our meta-synthesis. However, this was discarded because we considered older patients with mental impairment to be another type of group with very particular characteristics that could influence the phenomena studied, compared with older people without any cognitive impairment. In addition, the number of articles selected (n=12) for the present study can be interpreted as low compared with the studies considered for screening before title review (n=785). To justify this, a critical review of the articles found that a large majority of the articles did not reach the necessary depth in the study of any of the inclusion phenomena, either because they did not provide detailed information regarding the phenomenon development in the older patient, or for being listed as one more intervention to be studied without enjoying the prominence the study required to be incorporated. Due to language issues, interesting investigations may have been lost by handling only English and Spanish. This meta-synthesis includes studies from Europe, America and Australia, providing a broad perspective that, in turn, is a window to the peculiarities between the different cultures, how the study phenomena arise, and how power relations are established in the process. By including studies from Asia and Africa that could have passed the eligibility filter, we would have understood these similarities and variations from a global perspective. Focusing this study on the nursing field could be considered a limitation. However, we thought it necessary since there is little evidence of the inclusion and importance of the nursing figure in these processes, particularly in decision-making, which hardly exists in conceptual models of interprofessional shared decision-making.<a id=\"xref-ref-69-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-69\">69</a> For this reason, this study broadens the depth of the phenomena studied in a discipline that is only sometimes integrated into them. Our decision not to exclude studies because of limited descriptions of methods may be questioned. However, we strive to distribute the data and findings relatively evenly by subthemes (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-3-3\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC3\">online supplemental table 3</a>) to strengthen the informative insights of the results beyond the methodological quality of the primary studies.<a id=\"xref-ref-30-11\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30 35</a> Furthermore, one of the issues in qualitative profile studies is that the relationships between the participants and the researchers may have influenced the findings they obtained. However, this has enriched their nuance and adjusted to the particularity of shared decision-making situations, expressing preferences and active participation of older people and giving extra complexity to the depth of each study. Moreover, the researchers' knowledge and relationship with the participants may have been crucial for recruiting key participants and their subsequent data collection. In addition, the reflections made by the researchers could have increased the informative insights of the studies. Lastly, even though the methodology used in this study prevents the participation of older people, it becomes necessary to continue qualitative research that addresses this complex phenomenon that we have integrated.</p>\n",
       "<h2 class=\"\">Conclusion</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-113\">This meta-synthesis is based on previous studies revealing the implicit complexity in shared decision-making situations, expressing preferences and active participation of community-dwelling older adults. These phenomena are influenced by how older people approach their role in their binomial relationship with healthcare professionals. Those with a reinforced self-concept know that their personality has traits that make them face health-disease-related situations effectively and be communicatively assertive. In contrast, others with specific profiles make them lose sight of their potentially essential role in ‘taking care of themselves’. Healthcare professional characteristics are vital in how older people modulate their acting ability. Their personality, their communication skills and the type of approach healthcare professionals use towards older adults are what this study has reflected. The study phenomena are distorted due to how older people and healthcare professionals relate. When there is an imbalance of power between the two, reproduced through the discourse in those cases in which the relationship is not therapeutic, it causes situations of ageism. Then, the older person can perceive discrimination, differentiating the shared decision-making situations from those that are not (mirages), inhibiting the expression of their preferences, and preventing them from participating in their care. The context is a component that rose strongly, tipping the balance from one therapeutic side to another of <em>domination</em>, and vice versa, regulating how the study phenomena appear, interrelate and condition care in community-dwelling older adults. Regarding implications for future research and clinical practice, the great asset of this study is to offer a joint vision of the phenomena studied, allowing, on the one hand, favouring more integrative research and, on the other, making visible the care of the three elements to create new nursing-based interventions that act by synthesising them.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objectives</strong> To systematically synthesise the results of primary qualitative studies on how community-dwelling older adults experience shared decision-making processes, express preferences and actively participate in care.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> Systematic review of qualitative studies and qualitative meta-synthesis.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Methods</strong> We focused on studies about community-dwelling participants aged ≥65 undergoing a health-disease process circumscribed to a primary healthcare setting, and the central theme should focus on either shared decision-making, expressing preferences or patient participation. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus and PsycINFO (time publication frame 2012–2022). We excluded studies in those cases where the qualitative results were not analysed or unrelated to the phenomenon addressed, phenomena were not clear enough to be included or the setting did not occur in the community.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Results</strong> A total of 12 studies were included in this meta-synthesis. We appraised the quality of the selected studies through Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) Checklist. The metasummary comprised the frequency and intensity of qualitative patterns across the included studies. The meta-synthesis revealed four influential elements in their interaction: recognising personal qualities, facing professional characteristics, experiences of discrimination and a double-edged context.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> The phenomena studied were influenced by how older people approached their role in their binomial relationship with healthcare professionals. Those with a reinforced self-concept were better aware of health-disease-related situations regarding shared decision-making and the importance of being communicatively assertive. Professional characteristics were also crucial in how older people modulated their acting ability through their personality, communication skills and the approach healthcare professionals used towards older adults. Situations of discrimination generated through an imbalance of power inhibited the expression of preferences and hindered the active participation of older people.

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Introduction</strong> Hemiparetic gait is one of the most common sequelae of a stroke. Acupuncture has shown potential in correcting hemiplegic gait patterns and improving motor function recovery after stroke. However, controversial findings and a lack of supportive evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture for post-stroke hemiplegia. The intelligent gait analysis system provides a new perspective for the study of hemiparetic gait. This systematic review aims to collect relevant studies and critically evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in alleviating gait disturbance of post-stroke hemiplegia based on quantified gait parameters.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Methods and analysis</strong> A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane stroke group trials register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, AMED, three Chinese databases (Chinese Biomedical Literatures database (CBM), National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wan fang Digital Periodicals), four trails registries (The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, The Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, and The Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry) will be conducted to identify randomised controlled trials of acupuncture for gait disturbance in post-stroke patients. No restrictions on language or publication status. The primary outcomes are gait temporospatial parameters (eg, step length, stride length, step width, step frequency (cadence), walking speed, etc), and gait kinematic parameters (eg, hip peak flex/extend angle, knee peak flex/extend angle, ankle peak dorsi/plantar-flexion angle, etc). We will assess bias using the approach recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. A meta-analysis will be conducted to synthesise the evidence for each outcome measure. The χ<sup>2</sup> test and I<sup>2</sup> statistic will be used for assessing heterogeneity between studies.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Ethics and dissemination</strong> No ethical approval is needed because no primary data is collected. Scientific conferences or peer-reviewed journals will publish the findings.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Background</strong> Hand hygiene is an important measure to prevent disease transmission.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Objective</strong> To summarise current international guideline recommendations for hand hygiene in community settings and to assess to what extent they are consistent and evidence based.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Eligibility criteria</strong> We included international guidelines with one or more recommendations on hand hygiene in community settings—categorised as domestic, public or institutional—published by international organisations, in English or French, between 1 January 1990 and 15 November 2021.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Data sources</strong> To identify relevant guidelines, we searched the WHO Institutional Repository for Information Sharing Database, Google, websites of international organisations, and contacted expert organisations and individuals.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Charting methods</strong> Recommendations were mapped to four areas related to hand hygiene: (1) effective hand hygiene; (2) minimum requirements; (3) behaviour change and (4) government measures. Recommendations were assessed for consistency, concordance and whether supported by evidence.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> We identified 51 guidelines containing 923 recommendations published between 1999 and 2021 by multilateral agencies and international non-governmental organisations. Handwashing with soap is consistently recommended as the preferred method for hand hygiene across all community settings. Most guidelines specifically recommend handwashing with plain soap and running water for at least 20 s; single-use paper towels for hand drying; and alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) as a complement or alternative to handwashing. There are inconsistent and discordant recommendations for water quality for handwashing, affordable and effective alternatives to soap and ABHR, and the design of handwashing stations. There are gaps in recommendations on soap and water quantity, behaviour change approaches and government measures required for effective hand hygiene. Less than 10% of recommendations are supported by any cited evidence.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusion</strong> While current international guidelines consistently recommend handwashing with soap across community settings, there remain gaps in recommendations where clear evidence-based guidance might support more effective policy and investment.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> is the most common pathogen causing neonatal infections, leading to high mortality worldwide. Along with increasing antimicrobial use in neonates, carbapenem-resistant <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> (CRKP) has emerged as a severe challenge for infection control and treatment. However, no comprehensive systematic review is available to describe the global epidemiology of neonatal CRKP infections. We therefore performed a systematic review of available data worldwide and combined a genome-based analysis to address the prevalence, clonal diversity, and carbapenem resistance genes of CRKP causing neonatal infections.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We performed a systematic review of studies reporting population-based neonatal infections caused by CRKP in combination with a genome-based analysis of all publicly available CRKP genomes with neonatal origins. We searched multiple databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane, bioRxiv, and medRxiv) to identify studies that have reported data of neonatal CRKP infections up to June 30, 2022. We included studies addressing the prevalence of CRKP infections and colonization in neonates but excluded studies lacking the numbers of neonates, the geographical location, or independent data on <em>Klebsiella</em> or CRKP isolates. We used narrative synthesis for pooling data with JMP statistical software. We identified 8,558 articles and excluding those that did not meet inclusion criteria. We included 128 studies, none of which were preprints, comprising 127,583 neonates in 30 countries including 21 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) for analysis. We found that bloodstream infection is the most common infection type in reported data. We estimated that the pooled global prevalence of CRKP infections in hospitalized neonates was 0.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2% to 0.3%). Based on 21 studies reporting patient outcomes, we found that the pooled mortality of neonatal CRKP infections was 22.9% (95% CI, 13.0% to 32.9%). A total of 535 neonatal CRKP genomes were identified from GenBank including Sequence Read Archive, of which 204 were not linked to any publications. We incorporated the 204 genomes with a literature review for understanding the species distribution, clonal diversity, and carbapenemase types. We identified 146 sequence types (STs) for neonatal CRKP strains and found that ST17, ST11, and ST15 were the 3 most common lineages. In particular, ST17 CRKP has been seen in neonates in 8 countries across 4 continents. The vast majority (75.3%) of the 1,592 neonatal CRKP strains available for analyzing carbapenemase have genes encoding metallo-β-lactamases and NDM (New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase) appeared to be the most common carbapenemase (64.3%). The main limitation of this study is the absence or scarcity of data from North America, South America, and Oceania.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>CRKP contributes to a considerable number of neonatal infections and leads to significant neonatal mortality. Neonatal CRKP strains are highly diverse, while ST17 is globally prevalent and merits early detection for treatment and prevention. The dominance of <em>bla</em><sub>NDM</sub> carbapenemase genes imposes challenges on therapeutic options in neonates and supports the continued inhibitor-related drug discovery.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Reducing antibiotic treatment duration is a key component of hospital antibiotic stewardship interventions. However, its effectiveness in reducing antimicrobial resistance is uncertain and a clear theoretical rationale for the approach is lacking. In this study, we sought to gain a mechanistic understanding of the relation between antibiotic treatment duration and the prevalence of colonisation with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospitalised patients.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We constructed 3 stochastic mechanistic models that considered both between- and within-host dynamics of susceptible and resistant gram-negative bacteria, to identify circumstances under which shortening antibiotic duration would lead to reduced resistance carriage. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis of antibiotic treatment duration trials, which monitored resistant gram-negative bacteria carriage as an outcome. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for randomised controlled trials published from 1 January 2000 to 4 October 2022, which allocated participants to varying durations of systemic antibiotic treatments. Quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials. The meta-analysis was performed using logistic regression. Duration of antibiotic treatment and time from administration of antibiotics to surveillance culture were included as independent variables. Both the mathematical modelling and meta-analysis suggested modest reductions in resistance carriage could be achieved by reducing antibiotic treatment duration. The models showed that shortening duration is most effective at reducing resistance carriage in high compared to low transmission settings. For treated individuals, shortening duration is most effective when resistant bacteria grow rapidly under antibiotic selection pressure and decline rapidly when stopping treatment. Importantly, under circumstances whereby administered antibiotics can suppress colonising bacteria, shortening antibiotic treatment may increase the carriage of a particular resistance phenotype. We identified 206 randomised trials, which investigated antibiotic duration. Of these, 5 reported resistant gram-negative bacteria carriage as an outcome and were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis determined that a single additional antibiotic treatment day is associated with a 7% absolute increase in risk of resistance carriage (80% credible interval 3% to 11%). Interpretation of these estimates is limited by the low number of antibiotic duration trials that monitored carriage of resistant gram-negative bacteria, as an outcome, contributing to a large credible interval.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>In this study, we found both theoretical and empirical evidence that reducing antibiotic treatment duration can reduce resistance carriage, though the mechanistic models also highlighted circumstances under which reducing treatment duration can, perversely, increase resistance. Future antibiotic duration trials should monitor antibiotic-resistant bacteria colonisation as an outcome to better inform antibiotic stewardship policies.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n",
       "<p>Among individuals ≥ 65 years old, aortic stenosis is highly prevalent and the number of cases is expected to increase in the coming decades, due to the increased life expectancy. Nevertheless, the actual aortic stenosis burden is not well known in population settings and the impact of aortic stenosis on quality of life has not been studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate aortic stenosis impact on health-related quality of life in patients &gt; 65 years old.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods</h3>\n",
       "<p>An epidemiological case-control study was carried out to compare quality of life in patients ≥65 years old with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Demographical and clinical information was prospectively obtained and quality of life information was collected with the Short Form Health Survey_v2 (SF-12) questionnaire. The association between quality of life and aortic stenosis was determined using multiple logistic regression models.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Results</h3>\n",
       "<p>Patients with severe aortic stenosis self-perceived worse quality of life on all dimensions and summary components of the SF-12 questionnaire. In the final multiple logistic regression model a significant inverse association was observed between the dimensions ‘physical role’ and ‘social role’ (p = 0.002 and p = 0.005) and an association close to significance with ‘physical role’ (p = 0.052) of the SF-12 questionnaire.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n",

       "<p>Sickleweed (<em>Falcaria vulgaris</em>) is the name of a species of annual, and perennial herbaceous plants of the genus <em>Falcaria</em>. Climate change could negatively influnces the performance of various plant species in plant kingdom. In this study, 15 different sickleweed populations from seven provinces of the country were collected based on an unbalanced nest design with 10 replications and the percentage of essential oil, types of chlorophyll, phenol, proline, protein, and carotenoids were measured on them. The results showed that there was a significant difference between populations at the level of one percent for the studied traits. The results of the mean comparison showed that populations Ard-Shaban and Qaz-Ilan in terms of the evaluated traits and especially the percentage of essential oil were at the upper of the studied samples and selected as suitable populations. In addition, populations Gilan-Deylaman and Kur-Gerger-e Sofla were also identified as superior populations in terms of studied traits by cluster analysis and principle component analysis (PCA). Since the high level of proline and biochemical and physiological traits in plants can play a role in plants’ tolerance to stresses, therefore, populations with high values of these traits can be used in stress tolerance breeding programs. Therefore, in this study, populations Gilan-Deylaman and Kur-Gerger-e Sofla can be suitable populations for this purpose. In addition, the essential oil of this plant is used in the treatment of diseases, and therefore populations Ard-Shaban and Qaz-Ilan, which showed a high percentage of essential oil, can be used in breeding programs to increase the performance of this trait.</p>\n",

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Background: </span>Self-medication counseling in community pharmacies plays a crucial role in health care. Counseling advice should therefore be evidence-based. Web-based information and databases are commonly used as electronic information sources. EVInews is a self-medication–related information tool consisting of a database and monthly published newsletters for pharmacists. Little is known about the quality of pharmacists’ electronic information sources for evidence-based self-medication counseling.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>Our aim was to investigate the quality of community pharmacists’ web-based search results for self-medication–related content in comparison with the EVInews database, based on an adjusted quality score for pharmacists.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>After receiving ethics approval, we performed a quantitative web-based survey with a search task as a prospective randomized, controlled, and unblinded trial. For the search task, participants were instructed to search for evidence-based information to verify 6 health-related statements from 2 typical self-medication indications. Pharmacists across Germany were invited via email to participate. After providing written informed consent, they were automatically, randomly assigned to use either web-based information sources of their choice without the EVInews database (web group) or exclusively the EVInews database (EVInews group). The quality of the information sources that were used for the search task was then assessed by 2 evaluators using a quality score ranging from 100% (180 points, all predefined criteria fulfilled) to 0% (0 points, none of the predefined criteria fulfilled). In case of assessment discrepancies, an expert panel consisting of 4 pharmacists was consulted.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>In total, 141 pharmacists were enrolled. In the Web group (n=71 pharmacists), the median quality score was 32.8% (59.0 out of 180.0 points; IQR 23.0-80.5). In the EVInews group (n=70 pharmacists), the median quality score was significantly higher (85.3%; 153.5 out of 180.0 points; <i>P</i>&lt;.001) and the IQR was smaller (IQR 125.1-157.0). Fewer pharmacists completed the entire search task in the Web group (n=22) than in the EVInews group (n=46). The median time to complete the search task was not significantly different between the Web group (25.4 minutes) and the EVInews group (19.7 minutes; <i>P</i>=.12). The most frequently used web-based sources (74/254, 29.1%) comprised tertiary literature.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>The median quality score of the web group was poor, and there was a significant difference in quality scores in favor of the EVInews group.

       "<h4>Background</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The treatment of clinical complaints with over-the-counter (OTC) products plays a substantial role in health care [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></span>]. Community pharmacists are often the first and only point of contact within the health care system for self-medication–related inquiries [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></span>]. Self-medication counseling by pharmacists can contribute to a cost-effective, individualized, safe medical care on the patient level and consequently to a relief of the burden of the entire health care system [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref3\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref4\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></span>]. External evidence is required for well-grounded consultations and a key factor within the 3-fold evidence-based pharmacy (EbPharm) concept, which derived from evidence-based medicine [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref5\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></span>]. Apart from external evidence, the pharmacist’s practical experience and the patient’s preference should be considered when counseling [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref6\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref7\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></span>]. However, a lack of information sources, time, and search skills has been identified as common barriers to EbPharm [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref8\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref18\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></span>]. Consequently, various evidence-based information resources were introduced to reduce the evidence-to-practice gap. Among all information sources, electronic sources are of increasing importance for pharmacists [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref19\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref20\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></span>]. The majority of information sources are however not targeted for community pharmacists, especially not in the context of self-medication counseling [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref21\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref29\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></span>]. The EVInews project is an example for an electronic, evidence-based self-medication–related information platform for community pharmacists in Germany [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref30\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Little is known about the quality and the kind of electronic information sources that pharmacists use for evidence-based self-medication counseling. Information quality in the context of health is defined as a multidimensional concept that describes the fulfillment of individually predefined criteria [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref31\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref32\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></span>]. Several attempts have been made to measure the quality of electronic information sources through validated instruments [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref33\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref39\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></span>]. Standard categories of these instruments address an information source’s transparency, accuracy, completeness, and readability for instance [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref40\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></span>]. These instruments help identify valid information among the increasing body of available electronic data. Previous instruments, as a limitation, were only used for patient-oriented websites.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">To date, literature about the quality of pharmacists’ electronic information sources for self-medication counseling has been scarce. In particular, studies that investigate the quality based on appropriate standard quality criteria of such electronic information sources are missing.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Study Objectives</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Our aim was to investigate the quality of community pharmacists’ web-based search results for self-medication–related content when using the internet in comparison with the EVInews database, based on an adjusted quality score for pharmacists. Furthermore, this study attempted to explore what types of web-based sources are used for evidence-based self-medication counseling and how much time is needed under everyday practice conditions.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Methods\" data-label=\"Methods\">Methods</h3>\n",
       "<h4>Study Design</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A quantitative, unblinded, prospective randomized controlled trial including a web-based survey with an unblinded search task and a parallel study design was carried out between February 1, 2021, and April 30, 2021. The survey and data collection were conducted using SoSci Survey, Leiner DJ (version 3.1.06). Participating pharmacists were automatically assigned through the randomization function of the software in a 1:1 allocation ratio to either study group after giving their informed consent.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Study Population and Setting</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Community pharmacists across Germany within 5 different federal pharmacy chambers (Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower Saxony, and Saxony) were invited via an email to participate remotely and anonymously without any incentives. For this purpose, invitations containing the survey were sent via email to all community pharmacies that agreed to receive survey invitations and were listed in the email list of each federal pharmacy chamber. The completeness rate of the survey and time needed for completion were assessed through the SoSci Survey software. A reminder email was sent after 1 month if less than 15 participants within a pharmacy chamber were enrolled. Participants had to be licensed pharmacists to be included in the study.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Study Groups</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Participants were instructed to solely use either web-based information sources of their choice except for the EVInews database (web group) or exclusively the EVInews database (EVInews group). The EVInews group accessed the database via the link provided [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref41\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></span>] and a test account.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Survey Structure</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The survey was divided into 3 main categories as follows: sociodemographic data, verification of 6 health-related statements with assigned information source type from 2 typical self-medication indications (search task), and self-evaluation of search skills and feedback.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Search Task</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Participants of both study groups were asked to verify 6 health-related statements from 2 typical self-medication indications (Table S1 in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app1\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 1</a></span>) with a quote and the corresponding information source (search task). Of the 6 statements, 3 belonged to the self-medication indications recurrent herpes labialis and female androgenetic alopecia, respectively<i>.</i> The indications were chosen deliberately because they require specific knowledge but are nonetheless relevant for everyday practice, and content was available in the EVInews database.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A video and a short written summary were presented to all participants to inform them about the study protocol. The 3 statements of each indication were then displayed in an alternating order based on the software’s Rotate Blocks function to the participants. This was used to prevent learning effects and therefore a distortion of the results. Participants were then instructed to copy and paste their quote and link of the information source that proved or disproved the correctness of each statement in designated textboxes.</p>\n",
       "<h4>The EVInews Database</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The EVInews project was launched in 2017 and is based on the resolution of the Federal Union of German Associations of Pharmacists (ABDA) to help implement EbPharm into everyday practice. It consists of a website with general EbPharm information, monthly published newsletters, and a corresponding document-oriented database, which are free of charge. Once registered, users can access the database through a login. Independent pharmacists from the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at Leipzig University compose the newsletters with editorial assistance from AVOXA—Media Group German Pharmacist GmbH.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Quality Score</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">An adjusted quality score was used to assess the information sources that were used for the search task. Therefore, a rating scheme for the evaluation of the search task was created (Table S2 in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app2\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 2</a></span>).</p>\n",
       "<h4>Rating Scheme</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Rating scheme criteria were chosen and adapted based on validated quality scores and questionnaires reported in the literature [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref35\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref37\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></span>] as well as previous findings [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref32\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref39\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref42\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref44\" rel=\"footnote\">44</a></span>]. The rating scheme consists of 18 nominal- to ordinal-scaled criteria that address predefined quality standards. We selected existing and added new criteria that were relevant for the search task. The rating scheme criteria were grouped together in the categories “transparency,” “quality of evidence,” and “usability” for the information sources and “accuracy” for the evaluation of the quotes. Each quote’s accuracy was evaluated subjectively with regard to logic, rationale, and comprehension and objectively based on a summative content analysis. Of all items, 12 had a dichotomous response format and 6 had an ordinal response format.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Quality Assessment Procedure</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Participants’ quotes and sources were independently evaluated by 2 evaluators (MR and JMA) based on the rating scheme and merged after analysis completion. A total median was calculated based on the 2 different evaluations. The maximum quality score for a quote and information source for all 6 statements accounted to 180 points (ie, all criteria were fulfilled). Each rater was requested to provide reasons for point allocation.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Study Subgroups</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Because not all participants completed the search task of the survey, a subgroup analysis of these participants was performed as demonstrated in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure1\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 1</a></span>. Participants who chose at least 1 answer option including “I do not know” within the search task were defined as “met the eligibility criteria (‘all’).” Participants who chose 1 answer option and verified at least 1 statement with a quote and source were defined as “completed search task partially (subgroup ‘completed partially’).” Participants who verified all 6 health-related statements were defined as “completed search task fully (subgroup ‘completed fully’).”</p>\n",
       "<h4>General Study Procedure</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The study procedure is shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure2\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 2</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The survey consisted of 32 questions, which included close-ended and open-ended questions. Dichotomous, 4-point Likert scales and multiple-choice answer options were given. The level of measurement ranged from nominal- to ordinal-scaled data.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Outcome Parameters</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The primary outcome parameter was the difference in quality scores between the study groups. Secondary outcome parameters included a subgroup analysis, quality scores of the rating scheme categories of transparency, quality of evidence, and usability, the characterization of web-based information sources, a correlational analysis of sociodemographic characteristics and quality scores, a self-evaluation of search skills by the participants, and assessment of the time needed to perform the search task.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Sample Size</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The estimated sample size was calculated using the G*Power, software, Faul F, Erdfelder E, Buchner A, Lang AG (version 3.1). No information regarding the primary target distribution was available. Based on the results of a pilot test, a double-sided Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test for nonparametric, independent samples was used a priori to determine the required sample size for a significant difference in quality scores. At a significance level of α=.05 and a CI of 95%, a sample size of at least 44 pharmacists per group would provide a power of 1 – β=.80. We estimated attrition to be 50% and consequently strived for a greater sample size.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Data Analysis</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Only data of participants who processed the search task and did not violate the study protocol were included in the data analysis. The analysis was performed using Excel (versions 2105 and 2016; Microsoft Corp) and SPSS Statistics (version 25 and 26; IBM Corp). Results for the primary target parameter (quality score) were expressed as median and first and third quartile (Q<sub>25</sub>/Q<sub>75</sub>). They were compared using a 2-sided Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test for independent samples. The comparison of quality subscores was performed likewise with a Bonferroni correction. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the responses. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate the relationship between quality scores and sociodemographic data.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Quality Assurance Means</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">To ensure feasibility and exclude comprehension difficulties, pretests and pilot tests were conducted between October 26, 2020, and January 19, 2021. The pretests were carried out with 23 pharmacists. The first 12 pretests were executed using the think-aloud method, the remaining using the standard observation before the test. After a revision and adjustment of the survey and rating scheme, a pilot test with 37 pharmacists and advanced pharmacy students as pretesters was performed, resulting in minor modifications. Furthermore, to reduce subjective judgment on each quote’s suitability (item 4d within the rating scheme), 1359 relevant keywords in English and German were identified during the pretest phase and used for a summative content analysis. The frequency of these predefined keywords was measured through the Excel (Microsoft Corp) count function for each quote. To assess whether difficulties occurred during the completion of the search task, participants were asked to rate the clarity of this survey and give qualitative feedback if desired. Data generated by the pretest and pilot test were not included in this study.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Quotes and sources that were not analyzable based on the rating scheme by at least one of the evaluators were presented to an expert panel in May 2021. The expert panel consisted of 4 pharmacists specialized or mostly in continuing education to become a pharmacist with a focus on drug information, who were not involved in the EVInews project. Consensus-based point allocation was ultimately done by vote for the remaining uncertainties.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">To examine whether differences in rater performance were present, interrater reliability was assessed using the Cohen κ statistic. The Cohen κ coefficient for each item of the rating scheme and subsequently for all rating scheme items was calculated and compared with the qualitative interrater reliability descriptors by Landis and Koch [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref46\" rel=\"footnote\">46</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<h4>Ethics Approval</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Ethical approval for this study was granted by the ethics committee of the Medical Faculty of the Leipzig University (541/20-ek) on December 5, 2020.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Results\" data-label=\"Results\">Results</h3>\n",
       "<h4>Participant’s Characteristics</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The participant flowchart (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure1\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 1</a></span>) depicts the participants who have been enrolled.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The participant’s characteristics are summarized in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table1\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 1</a></span>. Of all 141 participants, 110 (78.0%) were female and 31 (22.0%) were male. The median age interval was between 41 and 50 years (31/141, 22.0%) and more than half of all participants had more than 11 years of work experience (79/141, 56.0%). A reminder email was sent to the members of the Pharmacy Chamber of Saxony because of a low response rate in the first round.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A Fisher exact test revealed no significant sociodemographic differences between the 2 study groups concerning gender, age, and academic degree.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Primary Outcome Parameter: Quality Score</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The median quality score of the Web group (n=71 pharmacists) was 32.8% (59.0 out of 180.0 points) and that of the EVInews group (n=70) was 85.3% (153.5 out of 180.0 points, <i>P</i>&lt;.001; <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure3\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 3</a></span>). The variability of the quality score in the Web group (IQR 23.0-80.5) was larger than that in the EVInews group (IQR 125.1-157.0). <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table2\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 2</a></span> displays all quality score results.</p>\n",
       "<p><sup>a</sup>The statements can be found in Table S1 in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app1\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 1</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p><sup>b</sup>AGA: androgenetic alopecia.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Secondary Outcome Parameters</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Results of the subgroup analysis of the subgroups entitled “completed partially” and “completed fully” are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table2\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 2</a></span> and illustrated in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure3\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 3</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Quality scores per rating scheme category were calculated and revealed statistically significant differences, as shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table3\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 3</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The web-based information sources that were provided by the participants for the search task varied greatly, as illustrated in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app3\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 3</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A total of 254 out of potentially 426 web-based information sources (6 statements × 71 participants) were given by 71 participants within the study arm of the web group to verify 6 health-related statements. A list of references was enclosed in 42.9% (109/254) of all web-based sources. Information about the author was provided in 69.7% (177/254) of all the web-based sources, and 34.3% (87/254) were published within the last 3 years (reference date February 1, 2021).</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The results of the correlational analysis are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table4\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 4</a></span>. A 2-tailed statistical significance was only detected for the positive correlation between the participant’s estimated annual frequency of searches and quality scores for both study groups and a negative correlation between the age, professional experience, and quality scores within the EVInews group.</p>\n",
       "<p><sup>a</sup>OTC: over-the-counter.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The responses of the self-evaluation (web group, n=44; EVInews group, n=58) were as follows. A total of 25% (11/44) of participants within the web group agreed fully that they were able to find the desired information in contrast to 71% (41/58) of the EVInews group. Furthermore, 46% (20/44) of the participants within the web group indicated that they conducted between no literature searches with literature databases such as MEDLINE via PubMed and 39% (17/44) to up to 12 per year in comparison with 40% (23/58) of the EVInews database users and 35% (20/58), respectively. Moreover, 39% (17/44) of participants of the web group estimated their search ability to find evidence-based self-medication information to be “rather good” and 5% (2/44) to be “very good.” Within the EVInews group, 59% (34/58) regarded their search ability to be “rather good” and 9% (5/58) to be “very good.” A total of 72% (42/58) of the EVInews group indicated that they were not familiar with the database before the study participation.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The times needed for the search task completion are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table5\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 5</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The median for the search task completion was 25.4 (IQR 12.7-43.5) minutes in the web group and 19.7 (IQR 13.6-28.4) minutes in the EVInews group. The completion times include participants who chose the escape option “I don’t know.”</p>\n",
       "<h4>Quality Assurance: Rater Performance</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The extent of agreement between the 2 raters measured using the Cohen κ statistic was “almost perfect” (κ=0.81-1) for the rating scheme items 1, 2, 4a, 4d-13, and 15-18. The extent of agreement on items 14 complied with “substantial agreement” (κ=0.780), items 3 and 4c with “moderate agreement” (κ=0.41-0.60), and item 4b with “slight agreement” (κ=0.077). All values were significantly different from zero (<i>P</i>&lt;.001). The extent of agreement in the form of an overall interrater descriptor for all rating scheme items accounted to κ=0.854.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Discussion\" data-label=\"Discussion\">Discussion</h3>\n",
       "<h4>Principal Findings</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">We found that the median quality score was significantly lower in the web group than in the EVInews group. Additionally, the variability of median quality scores in the web group was significantly larger and less participants completed the search task fully compared to the EVInews group. Web-based sources often did not meet standard quality requirements. The time needed for the search task completion did not reveal any considerable differences between the 2 groups. The data suggest that community pharmacists struggled to find web-based high-quality, evidence-based information sources for self-medication under everyday practice conditions.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Differences in Quality Scores and Potential Causes</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The web group obtained a significantly lower quality score with 32.8% of criteria fulfilled in comparison to 85.3% in the EVInews group. Several explanations for this result are possible. The statistically significant difference in quality scores may be explained by a lack of transparency information of many web-based sources, which ultimately resulted in lower scores. Examples of missing transparency information include publication dates, literature references, or authorship information. An analysis of the categories transparency and quality of evidence confirmed the persisting difference in scores in favor of the EVInews group.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Furthermore, a subgroup analysis was conducted because the difference in quality could be caused by participants who mostly chose the escape answer option “I don’t know.” A significant difference in quality scores remained when only data from participants, who verified all 6 health-related statements, were included.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The differences in quality scores between the participants could also be explained by personal factors such as different levels of work experience, knowledge, and the skills needed to quickly find suitable external evidence on the internet. However, significant differences in sociodemographic data between both groups were not existent. According to our correlational analysis, there was a positive association between the participant’s estimated annual literature searches and quality scores in both study groups. A negative correlation between the participant’s age as well as professional experience in years and quality scores was only observed within the EVInews group. This may indicate that with increasing practical literature search experience, the ability to find appropriate evidence could increase but with increasing age and professional experience decrease. The factors age and professional experience however only seemed to be associated with the quality scores of the EVInews group. It should be taken into consideration that EbPharm has been established in recent years, and therefore pharmacists who were trained over 30 years ago may not be familiar with this concept. Abu Farha et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref10\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></span>] similarly demonstrated a negative correlation among pharmacists between the familiarity with evidence-based medicine terms and professional experience.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Need for Customized Evidence-Based Information Sources for Pharmacists</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Most of the web-based information resources consisted of tertiary literature in the form of nonscientific pharmacy journals of varying quality and timeliness. Some information resources were 20 years old. Despite its simple nature as a document-oriented database, the majority of participants using the EVInews database “agreed fully” (41/58, 71%) in contrast to the web group (11/44, 25%) that they were able to find the desired information. Users need to sign in before accessing the EVInews database. The login with a username and password is comparable to other information platforms of this kind. This may be regarded as an obstacle to the database’s usage for everyday practice. However, when customers or other health professionals seek evidence-based advice related to OTC products, pharmacists may often not be able to immediately provide all the necessary information anyways. These cases require a search for external evidence under everyday conditions such as simulated in our study. The ability to find the desired information when confronted with such a search task is therefore of great importance and even greater importance than retrieval speed from our point of view. Nonetheless, it remains unknown how much low-quality sources impact the overall consultation quality. Furthermore, the dropout rate was greater in the web group. Only 22 participants within the web group in comparison with 46 within the EVInews group completed the entire search task and verified all 6 health-related statements.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Although the information retrieval times did not differ significantly, the participant’s search results under everyday practice conditions clearly did. An implication of this is the possibility that the participants were simply overwhelmed with the search task because they lacked the necessary search skills and therefore did not complete it fully. Subsequently, this leads to the question: what information do pharmacists rely on when selling OTC products if they cannot find it? These data may furthermore suggest that there is a need for training on how to find and appraise evidence as well as evidence-based information sources for community pharmacists. Because a lack of information sources and search skills is a common barrier to the implementation of EbPharm, information tools may help reduce the evidence-to-practice gap. The EVInews database fulfilled a majority of the standard quality requirements. Once further adjusted, it may be a promising electronic information tool for community pharmacists for evidence-based counseling.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Limitations</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A Hawthorne effect may have influenced the participants’ search behavior in both groups, prompting them to look for the very best evidence in the trial setting. Because of the web-based format, they were, however, not directly observed, and therefore this effect probably plays a minor role.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Raters and participants were not blinded. Because the type of information sources the users were allowed to use was predefined, blinding was not possible. To minimize subjective evaluation, a quantitative approach for the quality evaluation with objective criteria was chosen to ascertain a robust rating performance.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Only 2 OTC-relevant indications were chosen for the search task (Table S1 in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app1\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 1</a></span>). It remains questionable whether these 2 indications were adequate for the search task. Customers’ inquiries regarding the evidence or verification of advertising statements for the treatment of female androgenetic alopecia or recurrent herpes labialis are nonetheless common in everyday counseling practice and were therefore included in this study. Furthermore, on the basis of the pretests and pilot tests, we made sure that there is enough citable literature in German and English available to complete the search task.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The exclusion of tertiary print literature was due to technical difficulties when conducting the web-based survey. However, electronic information sources are frequently used among pharmacists nowadays, especially for the verification of health-related claims.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The rating scheme was not validated before the survey was conducted; hence extensive pretests and pilot tests were performed.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Conclusions</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Community pharmacists struggled to find high-quality electronic self-medication–related information sources under everyday practice conditions in the web group. This is of great importance as self-medication recommendations or simply the verification of statements should not be based on information resources of questionable quality. The search results of the EVInews group met many of the predefined standard quality criteria. Taken together, the findings suggest that there is a need for customized information sources for pharmacists. Evidence-based information tools such as the EVInews database may help in reducing the evidence-to-practice gap.</p>\n",

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Background: </span>To ensure the timely diagnosis of emerging infectious diseases, high-tech molecular biotechnology is often used to detect pathogens and has gradually become the gold standard for virological testing. However, beginners and students are often unable to practice their skills due to the higher costs associated with high-level virological testing, the increasing complexity of the equipment, and the limited number of specimens from patients. Therefore, a new training program is necessary to increase training and reduce the risk of test failure.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>The aim of the study is to (1) develop and implement a virtual reality (VR) software for simulated and interactive high-level virological testing that can be applied in clinical practice and skills building or training settings and (2) evaluate the VR simulation’s effectiveness on reaction, learning, and behavior of the students (trainees).<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>Viral nucleic acid tests on a BD MAX instrument were selected for our VR project because it is a high-tech automatic detection system. There was cooperation between teachers of medical technology and biomedical engineering. Medical technology teachers were responsible for designing the lesson plan, and the biomedical engineering personnel developed the VR software. We designed a novel VR teaching software to simulate cognitive learning via various procedure scenarios and interactive models. The VR software contains 2D VR “cognitive test and learning” lessons and 3D VR “practical skills training” lessons. We evaluated students’ learning effectiveness pre- and posttraining and then recorded their behavior patterns when answering questions, performing repeated exercises, and engaging in clinical practice.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>The results showed that the use of the VR software met participants’ needs and enhanced their interest in learning. The average posttraining scores of participants exposed to 2D and 3D VR training were significantly higher than participants who were exposed solely to traditional demonstration teaching (<i>P</i>&lt;.001). Behavioral assessments of students pre- and posttraining showed that students exposed to VR-based training to acquire relevant knowledge of advanced virological testing exhibited significantly improved knowledge of specific items posttraining (<i>P</i>&lt;.01). A higher participant score led to fewer attempts when responding to each item in a matching task. Thus, VR can enhance students’ understanding of difficult topics.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>The VR program designed for this study can reduce the costs associated with virological testing training, thus, increasing their accessibility for students and beginners. It can also reduce the risk of viral infections particularly during disease outbreaks (eg, the COVID-19 pandemic) and also enhance students’ learning motivation to strengthen their practical skills.<br></p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"h3-main-heading\" id=\"Keywords\">Keywords</h3>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Introduction\" data-label=\"Introduction\">Introduction</h3>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Several outbreaks of infectious viral diseases with high fatality rates have occurred over the last 20 years: COVID-19 (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus), the new avian influenza virus (ie, H7N9), and the respiratory syncytial virus. These have all caused high hospitalization rates [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref4\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></span>]. Immunocompromised patients are vulnerable to severe diseases caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and herpes zoster virus infections [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref5\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref8\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></span>]. Thus, a timely diagnosis is necessary for clinicians to determine the optimal treatment plan. Accordingly, rapid diagnoses with high fidelity comprise an important requirement for clinical virology laboratories.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The use of high-tech molecular technology for the rapid detection of pathogens in clinical specimens has gradually become the gold standard for clinical virological testing [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref9\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref10\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></span>]. Furthermore, quantitative or qualitative test analysis is used as an important indicator for medical diagnosis, treatment tracking, risk assessment, and health care information.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Molecular techniques are an important tool for clinical testing; however, the cost of molecular test reagents is high. Further, special and repetitive training is required to operate the testing equipment; consequently, clinical virology laboratories frequently prevent medical technology (MT) interns from practicing these procedures on their equipment. There are similar problems in teaching in other specialized areas involving clinical medical skills. For example, surgical training has always relied heavily on practical operations to ensure that physicians acquire the necessary technical proficiency to perform surgical procedures. After observing surgical procedures and animal experiments demonstrated by the teacher, intern surgeons practice the relevant technical skills while being supervised by the teacher. This teaching method may be limited by various factors, including medical ethics, working hours, and medical disputes. Therefore, scholars in the field of surgical teaching have recently developed simulation tools to teach residents to perform surgery. Virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality or tactile computer programs can simulate the surgical environment for teaching purposes and apply minimally invasive surgical robots [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref11\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref12\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Traditional teaching methods transmit medical knowledge via lectures and textbooks. However, many teachers have recently begun to introduce 2-way communication learning methods such as problem-based learning and flipped education. These methods aim to replace the prevalent unidirectional cramming teaching method by transforming students from passive to active agents; this can improve their learning effectiveness [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref13\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref17\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></span>]. Although each specialized field has its own special required skills and methods, clinical practice courses play a pivotal role in medical technologists’ development. Students must hone their practical skills to reduce their chance of failure in real-world settings. Therefore, the depth and breadth of students’ clinical training and whether they can actually engage in operational exercises will affect their learning.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The fully automatized BD MAX system developed by Beckton Dickinson Company integrates 2 functions: fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection and nucleic acid extraction. This detection system has 24 independent PCR heating elements, 5 different fluorescence channels, and can run different programs simultaneously. It processes 96-120 samples in 8 hours. It also has high efficiency for the detection of pathogens.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The BD MAX system is used in modern clinical virology laboratories for the detection of multiple clinical microbial nucleic acids present in emergent infectious pathogens. Although the BD MAX is powerful, the cost of reagents is high. Thus, clinical virology laboratories often prevent MT interns from practicing with their equipment. Schools often have scarce funds to obtain such advanced and expensive equipment for students to learn. Further, even if the students manage to understand the principles of the procedure after analyzing the operation manual and observing the workflow of a well-trained medical technologist, they often cannot access appropriate practical training. Therefore, it is critical to develop new teaching methods that allow MT students to put their skills into practice so that those who do not have the opportunity to engage in real-world practice with this specialized technology can still receive training.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">VR comprises a virtual environment that is similar to reality. Computer technology can simulate a high-fidelity space and allow users to immerse themselves inside that environment. In a VR environment, users wear a special display device (ie, VR headsets) to enter the simulation. In this space, the operator can use a controller or keyboard to interact with the virtual environment. Importantly, VR does not aim to replace real space. By combining a camera’s recognition technology and a computer program, a set picture appears in the lens, and the corresponding virtual objects appear. However, high-tech VR products have not yet been developed and used in the field of skill training for virological testing. Thus, this study designed and implemented a VR software to train MT students to use a high-level virological testing system (ie, BD MAX) and evaluated students’ learning effectiveness.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Methods\" data-label=\"Methods\">Methods</h3>\n",
       "<h4>VR System Description</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The proposed study was developed based on Oculus Rift and cross-platform Unity. Oculus Rift is a VR goggle developed and manufactured by Oculus VR. The Rift has 2 PenTile organic light–emitting diode displays and offers 1080×1200 resolution per eye, a 90-Hz refresh rate, and a 110-degree field of view. The device also features rotational and positional tracking as well as integrated headphones that provide a 3D audio effect. The separation of the lenses is adjustable using a slider on the bottom of the device to accommodate a wide range of interpupillary distances. The Rift allows for full 6-degrees-of-freedom rotational and positional tracking. Tracking is performed by Oculus’s Con.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Creating Course Features</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">We designed several virtual clinical and experimental scenarios for students to develop the relevant skills for virological testing in a realistic setting. By using VR, students can develop practical skills by engaging with interactive content, without being limited to merely reading about standard operating procedures.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Study Population</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Senior-year students from the Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology (ie, MT students) at the College of Medicine of National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) in Tainan, Taiwan enrolled in the Clinical Virology Internship Course. Of these, 31 MT students participated in a 2D VR cognitive test and a 3D VR practical simulation.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Cooperation Between the MT and Biomedical Engineering Groups in the Study</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The teachers of the MT department at NCKU were responsible for designing the lesson plan and questionnaires, as well as evaluating students’ learning effectiveness. The department of biomedical engineering (BME) was responsible for the development of the VR software. The VR-based training was carried out in the VR classroom of the BME department. System operation was carried out in the clinical virology room of the Pathology Department at NCKU Hospital.</p>\n",
       "<h4>The Cross-Disciplinary MT and BME Team</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Since March 2019, we have discussed the subject of VR-based teaching plans as well as clinical virology teachers’ needs and feedback on the VR software described in this study. The BME group adjusted and optimized the VR software for high-level clinical virological testing after regular brainstorming and discussion. As of June 2022, there have been a total of 45 meetings.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Design of the High-Level Clinical Virological Testing Lessons</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The BD MAX instrument is an automatic virus nucleic acid detection system and was selected as the basis for our VR project. It is currently used to detect a variety of microorganisms (eg, HSV, varicella-zoster virus [VZV], and cytomegalovirus) at the NCKU Hospital’s clinical virology laboratory.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The self-developed VR teaching software had both a test mode and a learning mode. The computer software registered students’ score and immediately provided them with detailed feedback on the results. Combined with the test items (which assessed students’ knowledge regarding HSV and VZV PCR), a series of matching tasks was designed to prepare learners to interact with the VR environment. The difficulty level of the items was measured by the frequency of drag-and-drops (the term “drag” refers to the behavior of sliding the button to the answer before actually selecting the answer in the VR scenario) when students attempted to answer a given item. There were 10 items designed on the usage of BD MAX. The user activity diagram of the proposed research is shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure1\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 1</a></span>, and the detailed flowchart of each mode is shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure2\" rel=\"footnote\">Figures 2</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure6\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></span>. The user manual is shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app1\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 1</a></span>. Items 1-10 are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure7\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 7</a></span>, and the picture of VR scenario is shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure8\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 8</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The virology (MT) group provided a video of the actual operation process using the BD MAX system (while detailing each used component) to the BME team to create a high-fidelity 3D VR component. We recorded the virological testing process or an introduction to the structure of the automatic testing system. We also used computer software to divide the procedure’s steps on BD MAX and performed the procedures. We disassembled the steps of the practical procedure, and the design internship students could control the 3D objects to simulate the experimental process through the human-machine interface. The learners performed the entire practice process in a virtual learning setting. In the VR environment, there was a setting to prompt the learner to proceed to the next step so they could simulate the actual testing procedure. The interactive mode included using the hands in the VR simulation to place the objects in the correct position: a special color was displayed if the order was correct. A warning was displayed if the order or position was wrong—students were instructed to try again until they were correct. Real scenarios are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure9\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 9</a></span>A and <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure10\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 10</a></span>A. 3D VR scenarios are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure9\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 9</a></span>B and <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure10\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 10</a></span>B.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">After all the virtual scenarios were tested, the VR classroom provided learners with a virtual space for learning and interaction.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Our research team used the concept of software reliability to test the VR software’s stability. First, we developed a test plan to analyze each functional requirement, the expected trigger function, and whether the results were correct. The failure status of the software was defined according to 3 levels (high, medium, and low). Reliability coverage testing was subsequently performed. Coverage tests were conducted for input domain behavior, input variables, and their combinations, as well as various usage functions. After the tests were completed, we wrote a test report based on the failure condition and its definition and then made the necessary corrections. Medium- and high-level risks were completely resolved before the VR software was presented to users for testing. The users were finally allowed to use the VR software.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Ethics Approval</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The Institutional Review Board of NCKU Hospital approved the study (B-ER-109-432). All of the students were informed about the aim and protocol of the study, and written informed consent was obtained from all of them.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Learning Effectiveness Evaluation</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The levels of the Kirkpatrick model were used to investigate reaction, learning, and behavior of the students (trainees). We designed questionnaires of VR application learning effectiveness evaluation for participants to fill out anonymously, including the “satisfaction of using different learning materials” (reaction level) and the “self-assessment questionnaire of participants’ knowledge application” (behavior level). The score of the item in the questionnaires was as follows: very disagree got 1 point, disagree got 2 points, no comment got 3 points, agree got 4 points, and very agree got 5 points. Questionnaires of behavior level were conducted during pre- and posttraining. We also used 10 items of “cognitive test and learning” lessons (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure7\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 7</a></span>) for written tests with registered identification number to evaluate learning level of students’ background knowledge of HSV or VZV and the operations of BD MAX. The score of each item was as follows: 11 points in item 1, 16 points in item 2, 7 points in item 3, 6 points in item 4, 3 points in item 5, 3 points in item 6, 6 points in item 7, 1 point in item 8, 6 points in item 9, and 6 points in item 10. A total score of 10 items was 65 points and was adjusted to 100 points afterward. These 10 items of written tests were tested at pretraining, posttraining after traditional demonstration teaching, and posttraining after VR teaching.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Statistical Analysis</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">SPSS for Windows (version 17.0; SPSS Inc) and SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) was used for statistical analysis. Quantitative data of “satisfaction of using different learning materials” (reaction level) are presented as mean values with 95% CI. We used nonparametric methods to analyze nonnormal distribution data in this study. Comparisons of pretraining, posttraining after demonstration teaching, and posttraining after VR teaching were scored via written tests and analyzed via Friedman’s test with posthoc analysis, that is, the Dunn-Bonferroni test. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to analyze the differences in the “self-assessment questionnaire of participants’ knowledge application” on pretraining and posttraining; the Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons adjustment.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Results\" data-label=\"Results\">Results</h3>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">From August 2021 to January 2022, 31 students from the Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology at NCKU in Taiwan used the novel self-developed VR software for 2D VR cognitive testing and 3D VR practical training for BD MAX. In total, 3 of them did not fill out the self-assessment questionnaire for behavior application.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Kirkpatrick Level I (Reaction): Evaluating Trainees’ Satisfaction</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">We designed 4 questionnaires to evaluate trainees’ satisfaction and identify their interest in learning. Assessments of the VR teaching material, the design fluency of the VR content, and the improvement in participants’ professional ability were included in the content. The contents of the items are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table1\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 1</a></span>. The students’ feedback showed that the use of 2D+3D VR teaching materials met students’ needs and enhanced their interest in learning. The item “VR-based teaching materials can increase my interest in learning” exhibited the highest scores in posttraining satisfaction. The results of posttraining satisfaction are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table1\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 1</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p><sup>a</sup>VR: virtual reality.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Kirkpatrick Level II (Learning): Determining the Trainees’ Learning Attainment</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">We designed 10 items (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure7\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 7</a></span>) to assess students’ background knowledge of HSV or VZV and the operations of BD MAX. There were included in the written tests and 2D VR teaching scenarios. The 3D VR teaching scenarios of the workflow of BD MAX procedures were developed. Written tests assessed students’ knowledge at pretraining, posttraining after exposure to traditional demonstration teaching, and posttraining after exposure to 2D+3D VR teaching. In the analysis of the learning hierarchy, it was found that the average score of 2D+3D VR teaching posttraining was higher than that for traditional demonstration teaching, and the learning effect was significantly better. The data are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure11\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 11</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Kirkpatrick Level III (Behavior): Assessing Trainee’s Knowledge Application</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">We designed 5 questionnaires to assess trainees’ knowledge application. The dimensions assessed included interpretation of the results and quality control; familiarity with the BD MAX procedure; understanding the principles, structure, and function of the BD MAX instrument; familiarity with the examination types, containers, transport, and storage conditions; and understanding virological testing’s clinical significance and possessing pertinent background knowledge. The results of participants’ self-assessment pre- and posttraining showed that trainees exposed to VR training to learn about high-level virological testing (using BD MAX) had significantly improved their detailed knowledge posttraining, vis-à-vis pretraining (<i>P</i>&lt;.001). The data are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure12\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 12</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<h4>The 2D Cognitive Software Analyzed the Number of Attempts Before the Correct Answer</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Our team designed a function of the 2D VR teaching software to record the “drags” (ie, attempts) for each item. The drags for each question were recorded and analyzed. The results showed that the higher the interns’ average score, the fewer drags they exhibited. We used this function to assess items’ difficulty level and used it as a reference for adjusting each lesson’s items (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure13\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 13</a></span>).</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Discussion\" data-label=\"Discussion\">Discussion</h3>\n",
       "<h4>Main Findings</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The use of VR software for teaching has become more popular in clinical medicine. Here, we designed and implemented a VR software for advanced MT training. The participants’ posttraining learning scores increased significantly after being exposed to 2D and 3D VR training. Participants exhibited significantly improved cognition of high-level virological testing posttraining. We analyzed the difficulty of the items and used it as a reference for adjusting them. Participants exposed to VR-based training considered that the VR-based teaching materials met their needs and enhanced their interest in learning.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Developing practical skills is paramount in the field of MT. MT students’ skill-development process begins in the basic experimental courses of natural science during their freshman and sophomore years and continues in the advanced experimental courses related to clinical testing in their junior year as well as the clinical courses in their senior year. MT interns perform more experimental operations than other departments in the medical field. The basic experimental practices performed in school differ significantly from clinical practice courses. In school, the designed laboratory course comprises relatively simple experiments for the students, considering the availability of equipment and resources. However, in the clinical virology practice course of the hospital, additional factors come into play, including the urgency of clinical work, the timeliness and accuracy of reports, the expensive cost of reagents, the complexity of instruments, and the limited number of specimens from patients. Therefore, MT beginners and students rarely have the opportunity to practice in real-world settings.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Due to the rapid development of molecular methodologies, the time required to detect viruses decreased significantly, from several days to 4-6 hours. Current detection procedures can detect multiple pathogens simultaneously, thus, becoming an invaluable tool for the clinical diagnosis of pathogenic infections [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref9\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref10\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref18\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref21\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></span>]. However, the test reagents required to detect multiple pathogens simultaneously are expensive (the cost of 1 test is about US $30), and the costs associated with the equipment are also high. The personnel require specialized training to operate the test instrument. Therefore, it is not possible for medical technological interns to practice in hospitals’ clinical virology laboratories. However, schools are also limited by the lack of proper funding, which makes it difficult for them to obtain advanced and expensive instrument for students to practice. Therefore, many intern students are limited to learning from the operation manuals and observing the operation of well-trained medical examiners. Therefore, it is important to use computer technology to develop new teaching methods that allow MT students who do not have access to this specialized technology to receive adequate training.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Mikropoulos et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref22\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></span>] investigated students’ views on VR learning and found that students generally held positive views regarding the use of VR in teaching while also verifying that VR can capture and maintain students’ attention. Many students expressed that it was exciting to be able to walk in and interact with the 3D VR world. VR simulation allows one to walk inside a molecule to study it in detail or, in the case of a block model, we can acquire a global perspective of a given city block at a distance. This allows the learner to develop a better understanding of the connections between the buildings, open space, and streets. Thus, VR will undoubtedly change the way we look at things and could even allow us to discover things that were previously unimaginable. It could also help people with disabilities break through their physical limitations and engage more actively in learning with their peers.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Of course, not all situations are suitable for the use of VR for education. Pantelidis [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref23\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></span>] established the following recommendations regarding the appropriate use of VR: (1) VR would be useful when using real objects is dangerous, impossible, or inconvenient; (2) virtual environments can be taught and trained in the same way as real objects; and (3) interacting with a model is as fun as interacting with the real thing.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Under the conditions of these 3 points, it is recommended to use VR for teaching in clinical virology laboratories. This research project was consistent with all 3 aspects. The BD MAX reagents are expensive, and the number of specimens is limited; thus, it is inconvenient to use a real BD MAX for learning. Other instruments required for PCR molecular detection can be similar to the real object. For interns, working with VR itself is a fun and fresh experience. Therefore, this research project was suitable for simulation using VR. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref24\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></span>] launched a VR teaching video: Biosafety Cabinet Edition in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">In addition to the simulated surgical training, VR technology has also been used in baby breathing training, emergency simulation training, dental education, stroke rehabilitation, dental dexterity training, pharmacy teaching, pain management, web-based weight control training, and other clinical applications in the field of medicine and medical care [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref25\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref36\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></span>]. Although all VR devices have similar structures, there are slight differences in hardware and software requirements in different fields as well as different application modes [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref37\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref39\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></span>]. For example, the VR simulation training device for teaching mainly focuses on the use of a 3D or 360-degree environment and network resources, whereas simulations for surgery focus on the interaction between the operator’s instruments and the living anatomy. The environmental design simulations mainly consider the patient’s emotional control and feedback [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref40\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref42\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Here, 2D cognitive software and 3D practical VR software of BD MAX lessons were developed. MT interns can use this system to familiarize themselves with the use of virological testing equipment and assess their learning. The results showed that the use of the VR software met the students’ needs and enhanced their interest in learning. In addition, scores from written tests after VR training (posttraining) were significantly higher than after traditional demonstration teaching (posttraining) in the learning level. The behavioral assessment of students pre- and posttraining showed that students exposed to VR training had significantly improved virological knowledge.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Limitations</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The appropriateness of the selection of teaching scripts may have affected the breadth and validity of the use of the teaching software. The fidelity of the 3D elements’ object art and production during VR scenarios requires professional art experts and additional funding support. Due to the limited number of students, this study only has 1 arm and uses a pre- and postcomparison design. Future work will use a randomized 2-arm design to better understand the impact of the technology.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Conclusions</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first self-developed VR software for high-tech virological testing training. This valuable tool increased MT students’ learning effectiveness. This not only provides beginners and students with the opportunity to operate BD MAX but also saves laboratory and educational costs, thus, enhancing their learning motivation and practical skills. It can also reduce the risk of viral infections particularly during transmitted disease outbreaks. Although VR cannot replace real human interactions, it does have many advantages, such as the freedom to modify, move, and place objects in the virtual world. Its free access is not restricted by time, and it can reduce certain risks. Thus, VR is a valuable teaching tool.</p>\n",

Counseling advice should therefore be evidence-based. Web-based information and databases are commonly used as electronic information sources. EVInews is a self-medication–related information tool consisting of a database and monthly published newsletters for pharmacists. Little is known about the quality of pharmacists’ electronic information sources for evidence-based self-medication counseling.<br></p>\\n<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>Our aim was to investigate the quality of community pharmacists’ web-based search results for self-medication–related content in comparison with the EVInews database, based on an adjusted quality score for pharmacists.<br></p>\\n<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>After receiving ethics approval, we performed a quantitative web-based survey with a search task as a prospective randomized, controlled, and unblinded trial. For the search task, participants were instructed to search for evidence-based information to verify 6 health-related statements from 2 typical self-medication indications. Pharmacists across Germany were invited via email to participate. After providing written informed consent, they were automatically, randomly assigned to use either web-based information sources of their choice without the EVInews database (web group) or exclusively the EVInews database (EVInews group). The quality of the information sources that were used for the search task was then assessed by 2 evaluators using a quality score ranging from 100% (180 points, all predefined criteria fulfilled) to 0% (0 points, none of the predefined criteria fulfilled). In case of assessment discrepancies, an expert panel consisting of 4 pharmacists was consulted.<br></p>\\n<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>In total, 141 pharmacists were enrolled. In the Web group (n=71 pharmacists), the median quality score was 32.8% (59.0 out of 180.0 points; IQR 23.0-80.5). In the EVInews group (n=70 pharmacists), the median quality score was significantly higher (85.3%; 153.5 out of 180.0 points; <i>P</i>&lt;.001) and the IQR was smaller (IQR 125.1-157.0). Fewer pharmacists completed the entire search task in the Web group (n=22) than in the EVInews group (n=46). The median time to complete the search task was not significantly different between the Web group (25.4 minutes) and the EVInews group (19.7 minutes; <i>P</i>=.12). The most frequently used web-based sources (74/254, 29.1%) comprised tertiary literature.<br></p>\\n<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>The median quality score of the web group was poor, and there was a significant difference in quality scores in favor of the EVInews group. Pharmacists’ web-based and self-medication–related information sources often did not meet standard quality requirements and showed considerable variation in quality.<br></p>\\n<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Trial Registration: </span>German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00026104; https://drks.de/search/en/trial/DRKS00026104<br></p>\\n<h3 class=\"h3-main-heading\" id=\"Keywords\">Keywords</h3>\\n<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Introduction\" data-label=\"Introduction\">Introduction</h3>\\n<h4>Background</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The treatment of clinical complaints with over-the-counter (OTC) products plays a substantial role in health care [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></span>]. Community pharmacists are often the first and only point of contact within the health care system for self-medication–related inquiries [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></span>]. Self-medication counseling by pharmacists can contribute to a cost-effective, individualized, safe medical care on the patient level and consequently to a relief of the burden of the entire health care system [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref3\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref4\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></span>]. External evidence is required for well-grounded consultations and a key factor within the 3-fold evidence-based pharmacy (EbPharm) concept, which derived from evidence-based medicine [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref5\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></span>]. Apart from external evidence, the pharmacist’s practical experience and the patient’s preference should be considered when counseling [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref6\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref7\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></span>]. However, a lack of information sources, time, and search skills has been identified as common barriers to EbPharm [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref8\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref18\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></span>]. Consequently, various evidence-based information resources were introduced to reduce the evidence-to-practice gap. Among all information sources, electronic sources are of increasing importance for pharmacists [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref19\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref20\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></span>]. The majority of information sources are however not targeted for community pharmacists, especially not in the context of self-medication counseling [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref21\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref29\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></span>]. The EVInews project is an example for an electronic, evidence-based self-medication–related information platform for community pharmacists in Germany [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref30\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></span>].</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Little is known about the quality and the kind of electronic information sources that pharmacists use for evidence-based self-medication counseling. Information quality in the context of health is defined as a multidimensional concept that describes the fulfillment of individually predefined criteria [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref31\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref32\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></span>]. Several attempts have been made to measure the quality of electronic information sources through validated instruments [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref33\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref39\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></span>]. Standard categories of these instruments address an information source’s transparency, accuracy, completeness, and readability for instance [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref40\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></span>]. These instruments help identify valid information among the increasing body of available electronic data. Previous instruments, as a limitation, were only used for patient-oriented websites.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">To date, literature about the quality of pharmacists’ electronic information sources for self-medication counseling has been scarce. In particular, studies that investigate the quality based on appropriate standard quality criteria of such electronic information sources are missing.</p>\\n<h4>Study Objectives</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Our aim was to investigate the quality of community pharmacists’ web-based search results for self-medication–related content when using the internet in comparison with the EVInews database, based on an adjusted quality score for pharmacists. Furthermore, this study attempted to explore what types of web-based sources are used for evidence-based self-medication counseling and how much time is needed under everyday practice conditions.</p>\\n<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Methods\" data-label=\"Methods\">Methods</h3>\\n<h4>Study Design</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A quantitative, unblinded, prospective randomized controlled trial including a web-based survey with an unblinded search task and a parallel study design was carried out between February 1, 2021, and April 30, 2021. The survey and data collection were conducted using SoSci Survey, Leiner DJ (version 3.1.06). Participating pharmacists were automatically assigned through the randomization function of the software in a 1:1 allocation ratio to either study group after giving their informed consent.</p>\\n<h4>Study Population and Setting</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Community pharmacists across Germany within 5 different federal pharmacy chambers (Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower Saxony, and Saxony) were invited via an email to participate remotely and anonymously without any incentives. For this purpose, invitations containing the survey were sent via email to all community pharmacies that agreed to receive survey invitations and were listed in the email list of each federal pharmacy chamber. The completeness rate of the survey and time needed for completion were assessed through the SoSci Survey software. A reminder email was sent after 1 month if less than 15 participants within a pharmacy chamber were enrolled. Participants had to be licensed pharmacists to be included in the study.</p>\\n<h4>Study Groups</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Participants were instructed to solely use either web-based information sources of their choice except for the EVInews database (web group) or exclusively the EVInews database (EVInews group). The EVInews group accessed the database via the link provided [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref41\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></span>] and a test account.</p>\\n<h4>Survey Structure</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The survey was divided into 3 main categories as follows: sociodemographic data, verification of 6 health-related statements with assigned information source type from 2 typical self-medication indications (search task), and self-evaluation of search skills and feedback.</p>\\n<h4>Search Task</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Participants of both study groups were asked to verify 6 health-related statements from 2 typical self-medication indications (Table S1 in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app1\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 1</a></span>) with a quote and the corresponding information source (search task). Of the 6 statements, 3 belonged to the self-medication indications recurrent herpes labialis and female androgenetic alopecia, respectively<i>.</i> The indications were chosen deliberately because they require specific knowledge but are nonetheless relevant for everyday practice, and content was available in the EVInews database.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A video and a short written summary were presented to all participants to inform them about the study protocol. The 3 statements of each indication were then displayed in an alternating order based on the software’s Rotate Blocks function to the participants. This was used to prevent learning effects and therefore a distortion of the results. Participants were then instructed to copy and paste their quote and link of the information source that proved or disproved the correctness of each statement in designated textboxes.</p>\\n<h4>The EVInews Database</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The EVInews project was launched in 2017 and is based on the resolution of the Federal Union of German Associations of Pharmacists (ABDA) to help implement EbPharm into everyday practice. It consists of a website with general EbPharm information, monthly published newsletters, and a corresponding document-oriented database, which are free of charge. Once registered, users can access the database through a login. Independent pharmacists from the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at Leipzig University compose the newsletters with editorial assistance from AVOXA—Media Group German Pharmacist GmbH.</p>\\n<h4>Quality Score</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">An adjusted quality score was used to assess the information sources that were used for the search task. Therefore, a rating scheme for the evaluation of the search task was created (Table S2 in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app2\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 2</a></span>).</p>\\n<h4>Rating Scheme</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Rating scheme criteria were chosen and adapted based on validated quality scores and questionnaires reported in the literature [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref35\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref37\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></span>] as well as previous findings [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref32\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref39\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref42\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref44\" rel=\"footnote\">44</a></span>]. The rating scheme consists of 18 nominal- to ordinal-scaled criteria that address predefined quality standards. We selected existing and added new criteria that were relevant for the search task. The rating scheme criteria were grouped together in the categories “transparency,” “quality of evidence,” and “usability” for the information sources and “accuracy” for the evaluation of the quotes. Each quote’s accuracy was evaluated subjectively with regard to logic, rationale, and comprehension and objectively based on a summative content analysis. Of all items, 12 had a dichotomous response format and 6 had an ordinal response format.</p>\\n<h4>Quality Assessment Procedure</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Participants’ quotes and sources were independently evaluated by 2 evaluators (MR and JMA) based on the rating scheme and merged after analysis completion. A total median was calculated based on the 2 different evaluations. The maximum quality score for a quote and information source for all 6 statements accounted to 180 points (ie, all criteria were fulfilled). Each rater was requested to provide reasons for point allocation.</p>\\n<h4>Study Subgroups</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Because not all participants completed the search task of the survey, a subgroup analysis of these participants was performed as demonstrated in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure1\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 1</a></span>. Participants who chose at least 1 answer option including “I do not know” within the search task were defined as “met the eligibility criteria (‘all’).” Participants who chose 1 answer option and verified at least 1 statement with a quote and source were defined as “completed search task partially (subgroup ‘completed partially’).” Participants who verified all 6 health-related statements were defined as “completed search task fully (subgroup ‘completed fully’).”</p>\\n<h4>General Study Procedure</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The study procedure is shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure2\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 2</a></span>.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The survey consisted of 32 questions, which included close-ended and open-ended questions. Dichotomous, 4-point Likert scales and multiple-choice answer options were given. The level of measurement ranged from nominal- to ordinal-scaled data.</p>\\n<h4>Outcome Parameters</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The primary outcome parameter was the difference in quality scores between the study groups. Secondary outcome parameters included a subgroup analysis, quality scores of the rating scheme categories of transparency, quality of evidence, and usability, the characterization of web-based information sources, a correlational analysis of sociodemographic characteristics and quality scores, a self-evaluation of search skills by the participants, and assessment of the time needed to perform the search task.</p>\\n<h4>Sample Size</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The estimated sample size was calculated using the G*Power, software, Faul F, Erdfelder E, Buchner A, Lang AG (version 3.1). No information regarding the primary target distribution was available. Based on the results of a pilot test, a double-sided Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test for nonparametric, independent samples was used a priori to determine the required sample size for a significant difference in quality scores. At a significance level of α=.05 and a CI of 95%, a sample size of at least 44 pharmacists per group would provide a power of 1 – β=.80. We estimated attrition to be 50% and consequently strived for a greater sample size.</p>\\n<h4>Data Analysis</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Only data of participants who processed the search task and did not violate the study protocol were included in the data analysis. The analysis was performed using Excel (versions 2105 and 2016; Microsoft Corp) and SPSS Statistics (version 25 and 26; IBM Corp). Results for the primary target parameter (quality score) were expressed as median and first and third quartile (Q<sub>25</sub>/Q<sub>75</sub>). They were compared using a 2-sided Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test for independent samples. The comparison of quality subscores was performed likewise with a Bonferroni correction. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the responses. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate the relationship between quality scores and sociodemographic data.</p>\\n<h4>Quality Assurance Means</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">To ensure feasibility and exclude comprehension difficulties, pretests and pilot tests were conducted between October 26, 2020, and January 19, 2021. The pretests were carried out with 23 pharmacists. The first 12 pretests were executed using the think-aloud method, the remaining using the standard observation before the test. After a revision and adjustment of the survey and rating scheme, a pilot test with 37 pharmacists and advanced pharmacy students as pretesters was performed, resulting in minor modifications. Furthermore, to reduce subjective judgment on each quote’s suitability (item 4d within the rating scheme), 1359 relevant keywords in English and German were identified during the pretest phase and used for a summative content analysis. The frequency of these predefined keywords was measured through the Excel (Microsoft Corp) count function for each quote. To assess whether difficulties occurred during the completion of the search task, participants were asked to rate the clarity of this survey and give qualitative feedback if desired. Data generated by the pretest and pilot test were not included in this study.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Quotes and sources that were not analyzable based on the rating scheme by at least one of the evaluators were presented to an expert panel in May 2021. The expert panel consisted of 4 pharmacists specialized or mostly in continuing education to become a pharmacist with a focus on drug information, who were not involved in the EVInews project. Consensus-based point allocation was ultimately done by vote for the remaining uncertainties.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">To examine whether differences in rater performance were present, interrater reliability was assessed using the Cohen κ statistic. The Cohen κ coefficient for each item of the rating scheme and subsequently for all rating scheme items was calculated and compared with the qualitative interrater reliability descriptors by Landis and Koch [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref46\" rel=\"footnote\">46</a></span>].</p>\\n<h4>Ethics Approval</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Ethical approval for this study was granted by the ethics committee of the Medical Faculty of the Leipzig University (541/20-ek) on December 5, 2020.</p>\\n<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Results\" data-label=\"Results\">Results</h3>\\n<h4>Participant’s Characteristics</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The participant flowchart (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure1\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 1</a></span>) depicts the participants who have been enrolled.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The participant’s characteristics are summarized in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table1\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 1</a></span>. Of all 141 participants, 110 (78.0%) were female and 31 (22.0%) were male. The median age interval was between 41 and 50 years (31/141, 22.0%) and more than half of all participants had more than 11 years of work experience (79/141, 56.0%). A reminder email was sent to the members of the Pharmacy Chamber of Saxony because of a low response rate in the first round.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A Fisher exact test revealed no significant sociodemographic differences between the 2 study groups concerning gender, age, and academic degree.</p>\\n<h4>Primary Outcome Parameter: Quality Score</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The median quality score of the Web group (n=71 pharmacists) was 32.8% (59.0 out of 180.0 points) and that of the EVInews group (n=70) was 85.3% (153.5 out of 180.0 points, <i>P</i>&lt;.001; <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure3\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 3</a></span>). The variability of the quality score in the Web group (IQR 23.0-80.5) was larger than that in the EVInews group (IQR 125.1-157.0). <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table2\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 2</a></span> displays all quality score results.</p>\\n<p><sup>a</sup>The statements can be found in Table S1 in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app1\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 1</a></span>.</p>\\n<p><sup>b</sup>AGA: androgenetic alopecia.</p>\\n<h4>Secondary Outcome Parameters</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Results of the subgroup analysis of the subgroups entitled “completed partially” and “completed fully” are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table2\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 2</a></span> and illustrated in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure3\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 3</a></span>.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Quality scores per rating scheme category were calculated and revealed statistically significant differences, as shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table3\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 3</a></span>.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The web-based information sources that were provided by the participants for the search task varied greatly, as illustrated in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app3\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 3</a></span>.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A total of 254 out of potentially 426 web-based information sources (6 statements × 71 participants) were given by 71 participants within the study arm of the web group to verify 6 health-related statements. A list of references was enclosed in 42.9% (109/254) of all web-based sources. Information about the author was provided in 69.7% (177/254) of all the web-based sources, and 34.3% (87/254) were published within the last 3 years (reference date February 1, 2021).</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The results of the correlational analysis are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table4\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 4</a></span>. A 2-tailed statistical significance was only detected for the positive correlation between the participant’s estimated annual frequency of searches and quality scores for both study groups and a negative correlation between the age, professional experience, and quality scores within the EVInews group.</p>\\n<p><sup>a</sup>OTC: over-the-counter.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The responses of the self-evaluation (web group, n=44; EVInews group, n=58) were as follows. A total of 25% (11/44) of participants within the web group agreed fully that they were able to find the desired information in contrast to 71% (41/58) of the EVInews group. Furthermore, 46% (20/44) of the participants within the web group indicated that they conducted between no literature searches with literature databases such as MEDLINE via PubMed and 39% (17/44) to up to 12 per year in comparison with 40% (23/58) of the EVInews database users and 35% (20/58), respectively. Moreover, 39% (17/44) of participants of the web group estimated their search ability to find evidence-based self-medication information to be “rather good” and 5% (2/44) to be “very good.” Within the EVInews group, 59% (34/58) regarded their search ability to be “rather good” and 9% (5/58) to be “very good.” A total of 72% (42/58) of the EVInews group indicated that they were not familiar with the database before the study participation.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The times needed for the search task completion are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table5\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 5</a></span>.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The median for the search task completion was 25.4 (IQR 12.7-43.5) minutes in the web group and 19.7 (IQR 13.6-28.4) minutes in the EVInews group. The completion times include participants who chose the escape option “I don’t know.”</p>\\n<h4>Quality Assurance: Rater Performance</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The extent of agreement between the 2 raters measured using the Cohen κ statistic was “almost perfect” (κ=0.81-1) for the rating scheme items 1, 2, 4a, 4d-13, and 15-18. The extent of agreement on items 14 complied with “substantial agreement” (κ=0.780), items 3 and 4c with “moderate agreement” (κ=0.41-0.60), and item 4b with “slight agreement” (κ=0.077). All values were significantly different from zero (<i>P</i>&lt;.001). The extent of agreement in the form of an overall interrater descriptor for all rating scheme items accounted to κ=0.854.</p>\\n<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Discussion\" data-label=\"Discussion\">Discussion</h3>\\n<h4>Principal Findings</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">We found that the median quality score was significantly lower in the web group than in the EVInews group. Additionally, the variability of median quality scores in the web group was significantly larger and less participants completed the search task fully compared to the EVInews group. Web-based sources often did not meet standard quality requirements. The time needed for the search task completion did not reveal any considerable differences between the 2 groups. The data suggest that community pharmacists struggled to find web-based high-quality, evidence-based information sources for self-medication under everyday practice conditions.</p>\\n<h4>Differences in Quality Scores and Potential Causes</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The web group obtained a significantly lower quality score with 32.8% of criteria fulfilled in comparison to 85.3% in the EVInews group. Several explanations for this result are possible. The statistically significant difference in quality scores may be explained by a lack of transparency information of many web-based sources, which ultimately resulted in lower scores. Examples of missing transparency information include publication dates, literature references, or authorship information. An analysis of the categories transparency and quality of evidence confirmed the persisting difference in scores in favor of the EVInews group.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Furthermore, a subgroup analysis was conducted because the difference in quality could be caused by participants who mostly chose the escape answer option “I don’t know.” A significant difference in quality scores remained when only data from participants, who verified all 6 health-related statements, were included.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The differences in quality scores between the participants could also be explained by personal factors such as different levels of work experience, knowledge, and the skills needed to quickly find suitable external evidence on the internet. However, significant differences in sociodemographic data between both groups were not existent. According to our correlational analysis, there was a positive association between the participant’s estimated annual literature searches and quality scores in both study groups. A negative correlation between the participant’s age as well as professional experience in years and quality scores was only observed within the EVInews group. This may indicate that with increasing practical literature search experience, the ability to find appropriate evidence could increase but with increasing age and professional experience decrease. The factors age and professional experience however only seemed to be associated with the quality scores of the EVInews group. It should be taken into consideration that EbPharm has been established in recent years, and therefore pharmacists who were trained over 30 years ago may not be familiar with this concept. Abu Farha et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref10\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></span>] similarly demonstrated a negative correlation among pharmacists between the familiarity with evidence-based medicine terms and professional experience.</p>\\n<h4>Need for Customized Evidence-Based Information Sources for Pharmacists</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Most of the web-based information resources consisted of tertiary literature in the form of nonscientific pharmacy journals of varying quality and timeliness. Some information resources were 20 years old. Despite its simple nature as a document-oriented database, the majority of participants using the EVInews database “agreed fully” (41/58, 71%) in contrast to the web group (11/44, 25%) that they were able to find the desired information. Users need to sign in before accessing the EVInews database. The login with a username and password is comparable to other information platforms of this kind. This may be regarded as an obstacle to the database’s usage for everyday practice. However, when customers or other health professionals seek evidence-based advice related to OTC products, pharmacists may often not be able to immediately provide all the necessary information anyways. These cases require a search for external evidence under everyday conditions such as simulated in our study. The ability to find the desired information when confronted with such a search task is therefore of great importance and even greater importance than retrieval speed from our point of view. Nonetheless, it remains unknown how much low-quality sources impact the overall consultation quality. Furthermore, the dropout rate was greater in the web group. Only 22 participants within the web group in comparison with 46 within the EVInews group completed the entire search task and verified all 6 health-related statements.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Although the information retrieval times did not differ significantly, the participant’s search results under everyday practice conditions clearly did. An implication of this is the possibility that the participants were simply overwhelmed with the search task because they lacked the necessary search skills and therefore did not complete it fully. Subsequently, this leads to the question: what information do pharmacists rely on when selling OTC products if they cannot find it? These data may furthermore suggest that there is a need for training on how to find and appraise evidence as well as evidence-based information sources for community pharmacists. Because a lack of information sources and search skills is a common barrier to the implementation of EbPharm, information tools may help reduce the evidence-to-practice gap. The EVInews database fulfilled a majority of the standard quality requirements. Once further adjusted, it may be a promising electronic information tool for community pharmacists for evidence-based counseling.</p>\\n<h4>Limitations</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A Hawthorne effect may have influenced the participants’ search behavior in both groups, prompting them to look for the very best evidence in the trial setting. Because of the web-based format, they were, however, not directly observed, and therefore this effect probably plays a minor role.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Raters and participants were not blinded. Because the type of information sources the users were allowed to use was predefined, blinding was not possible. To minimize subjective evaluation, a quantitative approach for the quality evaluation with objective criteria was chosen to ascertain a robust rating performance.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Only 2 OTC-relevant indications were chosen for the search task (Table S1 in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app1\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 1</a></span>). It remains questionable whether these 2 indications were adequate for the search task. Customers’ inquiries regarding the evidence or verification of advertising statements for the treatment of female androgenetic alopecia or recurrent herpes labialis are nonetheless common in everyday counseling practice and were therefore included in this study. Furthermore, on the basis of the pretests and pilot tests, we made sure that there is enough citable literature in German and English available to complete the search task.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The exclusion of tertiary print literature was due to technical difficulties when conducting the web-based survey. However, electronic information sources are frequently used among pharmacists nowadays, especially for the verification of health-related claims.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The rating scheme was not validated before the survey was conducted; hence extensive pretests and pilot tests were performed.</p>\\n<h4>Conclusions</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Community pharmacists struggled to find high-quality electronic self-medication–related information sources under everyday practice conditions in the web group. This is of great importance as self-medication recommendations or simply the verification of statements should not be based on information resources of questionable quality. The search results of the EVInews group met many of the predefined standard quality criteria. Taken together, the findings suggest that there is a need for customized information sources for pharmacists. Evidence-based information tools such as the EVInews database may help in reducing the evidence-to-practice gap.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<h4 class=\"h4-border-top\">Acknowledgments</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">We thank all the collaborators and participants of the survey as well as the ABDA (Federal Union of German Associations of Pharmacists e.V.) and Avoxa (Media Group of German Pharmacists GmbH) for financial support of the EVInews project.

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Background: </span>Self-medication counseling in community pharmacies plays a crucial role in health care. Counseling advice should therefore be evidence-based. Web-based information and databases are commonly used as electronic information sources. EVInews is a self-medication–related information tool consisting of a database and monthly published newsletters for pharmacists. Little is known about the quality of pharmacists’ electronic information sources for evidence-based self-medication counseling.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>Our aim was to investigate the quality of community pharmacists’ web-based search results for self-medication–related content in comparison with the EVInews database, based on an adjusted quality score for pharmacists.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>After receiving ethics approval, we performed a quantitative web-based survey with a search task as a prospective randomized, controlled, and unblinded trial. For the search task, participants were instructed to search for evidence-based information to verify 6 health-related statements from 2 typical self-medication indications. Pharmacists across Germany were invited via email to participate. After providing written informed consent, they were automatically, randomly assigned to use either web-based information sources of their choice without the EVInews database (web group) or exclusively the EVInews database (EVInews group). The quality of the information sources that were used for the search task was then assessed by 2 evaluators using a quality score ranging from 100% (180 points, all predefined criteria fulfilled) to 0% (0 points, none of the predefined criteria fulfilled). In case of assessment discrepancies, an expert panel consisting of 4 pharmacists was consulted.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>In total, 141 pharmacists were enrolled. In the Web group (n=71 pharmacists), the median quality score was 32.8% (59.0 out of 180.0 points; IQR 23.0-80.5). In the EVInews group (n=70 pharmacists), the median quality score was significantly higher (85.3%; 153.5 out of 180.0 points; <i>P</i>&lt;.001) and the IQR was smaller (IQR 125.1-157.0). Fewer pharmacists completed the entire search task in the Web group (n=22) than in the EVInews group (n=46). The median time to complete the search task was not significantly different between the Web group (25.4 minutes) and the EVInews group (19.7 minutes; <i>P</i>=.12). The most frequently used web-based sources (74/254, 29.1%) comprised tertiary literature.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>The median quality score of the web group was poor, and there was a significant difference in quality scores in favor of the EVInews group.

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Background: </span>To ensure the timely diagnosis of emerging infectious diseases, high-tech molecular biotechnology is often used to detect pathogens and has gradually become the gold standard for virological testing. However, beginners and students are often unable to practice their skills due to the higher costs associated with high-level virological testing, the increasing complexity of the equipment, and the limited number of specimens from patients. Therefore, a new training program is necessary to increase training and reduce the risk of test failure.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>The aim of the study is to (1) develop and implement a virtual reality (VR) software for simulated and interactive high-level virological testing that can be applied in clinical practice and skills building or training settings and (2) evaluate the VR simulation’s effectiveness on reaction, learning, and behavior of the students (trainees).<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>Viral nucleic acid tests on a BD MAX instrument were selected for our VR project because it is a high-tech automatic detection system. There was cooperation between teachers of medical technology and biomedical engineering. Medical technology teachers were responsible for designing the lesson plan, and the biomedical engineering personnel developed the VR software. We designed a novel VR teaching software to simulate cognitive learning via various procedure scenarios and interactive models. The VR software contains 2D VR “cognitive test and learning” lessons and 3D VR “practical skills training” lessons. We evaluated students’ learning effectiveness pre- and posttraining and then recorded their behavior patterns when answering questions, performing repeated exercises, and engaging in clinical practice.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>The results showed that the use of the VR software met participants’ needs and enhanced their interest in learning. The average posttraining scores of participants exposed to 2D and 3D VR training were significantly higher than participants who were exposed solely to traditional demonstration teaching (<i>P</i>&lt;.001). Behavioral assessments of students pre- and posttraining showed that students exposed to VR-based training to acquire relevant knowledge of advanced virological testing exhibited significantly improved knowledge of specific items posttraining (<i>P</i>&lt;.01). A higher participant score led to fewer attempts when responding to each item in a matching task. Thus, VR can enhance students’ understanding of difficult topics.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>The VR program designed for this study can reduce the costs associated with virological testing training, thus, increasing their accessibility for students and beginners. It can also reduce the risk of viral infections particularly during disease outbreaks (eg, the COVID-19 pandemic) and also enhance students’ learning motivation to strengthen their practical skills.<br></p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Objective</strong> To summarise current international guideline recommendations for hand hygiene in community settings and to assess to what extent they are consistent and evidence based.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Eligibility criteria</strong> We included international guidelines with one or more recommendations on hand hygiene in community settings—categorised as domestic, public or institutional—published by international organisations, in English or French, between 1 January 1990 and 15 November 2021.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Data sources</strong> To identify relevant guidelines, we searched the WHO Institutional Repository for Information Sharing Database, Google, websites of international organisations, and contacted expert organisations and individuals.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Charting methods</strong> Recommendations were mapped to four areas related to hand hygiene: (1) effective hand hygiene; (2) minimum requirements; (3) behaviour change and (4) government measures. Recommendations were assessed for consistency, concordance and whether supported by evidence.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> We identified 51 guidelines containing 923 recommendations published between 1999 and 2021 by multilateral agencies and international non-governmental organisations. Handwashing with soap is consistently recommended as the preferred method for hand hygiene across all community settings. Most guidelines specifically recommend handwashing with plain soap and running water for at least 20 s; single-use paper towels for hand drying; and alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) as a complement or alternative to handwashing. There are inconsistent and discordant recommendations for water quality for handwashing, affordable and effective alternatives to soap and ABHR, and the design of handwashing stations. There are gaps in recommendations on soap and water quantity, behaviour change approaches and government measures required for effective hand hygiene. Less than 10% of recommendations are supported by any cited evidence.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusion</strong> While current international guidelines consistently recommend handwashing with soap across community settings, there remain gaps in recommendations where clear evidence-based guidance might support more effective policy and investment.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> is the most common pathogen causing neonatal infections, leading to high mortality worldwide. Along with increasing antimicrobial use in neonates, carbapenem-resistant <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> (CRKP) has emerged as a severe challenge for infection control and treatment. However, no comprehensive systematic review is available to describe the global epidemiology of neonatal CRKP infections. We therefore performed a systematic review of available data worldwide and combined a genome-based analysis to address the prevalence, clonal diversity, and carbapenem resistance genes of CRKP causing neonatal infections.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We performed a systematic review of studies reporting population-based neonatal infections caused by CRKP in combination with a genome-based analysis of all publicly available CRKP genomes with neonatal origins. We searched multiple databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane, bioRxiv, and medRxiv) to identify studies that have reported data of neonatal CRKP infections up to June 30, 2022. We included studies addressing the prevalence of CRKP infections and colonization in neonates but excluded studies lacking the numbers of neonates, the geographical location, or independent data on <em>Klebsiella</em> or CRKP isolates. We used narrative synthesis for pooling data with JMP statistical software. We identified 8,558 articles and excluding those that did not meet inclusion criteria. We included 128 studies, none of which were preprints, comprising 127,583 neonates in 30 countries including 21 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) for analysis. We found that bloodstream infection is the most common infection type in reported data. We estimated that the pooled global prevalence of CRKP infections in hospitalized neonates was 0.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2% to 0.3%). Based on 21 studies reporting patient outcomes, we found that the pooled mortality of neonatal CRKP infections was 22.9% (95% CI, 13.0% to 32.9%). A total of 535 neonatal CRKP genomes were identified from GenBank including Sequence Read Archive, of which 204 were not linked to any publications. We incorporated the 204 genomes with a literature review for understanding the species distribution, clonal diversity, and carbapenemase types. We identified 146 sequence types (STs) for neonatal CRKP strains and found that ST17, ST11, and ST15 were the 3 most common lineages. In particular, ST17 CRKP has been seen in neonates in 8 countries across 4 continents. The vast majority (75.3%) of the 1,592 neonatal CRKP strains available for analyzing carbapenemase have genes encoding metallo-β-lactamases and NDM (New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase) appeared to be the most common carbapenemase (64.3%). The main limitation of this study is the absence or scarcity of data from North America, South America, and Oceania.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>CRKP contributes to a considerable number of neonatal infections and leads to significant neonatal mortality. Neonatal CRKP strains are highly diverse, while ST17 is globally prevalent and merits early detection for treatment and prevention. The dominance of <em>bla</em><sub>NDM</sub> carbapenemase genes imposes challenges on therapeutic options in neonates and supports the continued inhibitor-related drug discovery.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Reducing antibiotic treatment duration is a key component of hospital antibiotic stewardship interventions. However, its effectiveness in reducing antimicrobial resistance is uncertain and a clear theoretical rationale for the approach is lacking. In this study, we sought to gain a mechanistic understanding of the relation between antibiotic treatment duration and the prevalence of colonisation with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospitalised patients.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We constructed 3 stochastic mechanistic models that considered both between- and within-host dynamics of susceptible and resistant gram-negative bacteria, to identify circumstances under which shortening antibiotic duration would lead to reduced resistance carriage. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis of antibiotic treatment duration trials, which monitored resistant gram-negative bacteria carriage as an outcome. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for randomised controlled trials published from 1 January 2000 to 4 October 2022, which allocated participants to varying durations of systemic antibiotic treatments. Quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials. The meta-analysis was performed using logistic regression. Duration of antibiotic treatment and time from administration of antibiotics to surveillance culture were included as independent variables. Both the mathematical modelling and meta-analysis suggested modest reductions in resistance carriage could be achieved by reducing antibiotic treatment duration. The models showed that shortening duration is most effective at reducing resistance carriage in high compared to low transmission settings. For treated individuals, shortening duration is most effective when resistant bacteria grow rapidly under antibiotic selection pressure and decline rapidly when stopping treatment. Importantly, under circumstances whereby administered antibiotics can suppress colonising bacteria, shortening antibiotic treatment may increase the carriage of a particular resistance phenotype. We identified 206 randomised trials, which investigated antibiotic duration. Of these, 5 reported resistant gram-negative bacteria carriage as an outcome and were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis determined that a single additional antibiotic treatment day is associated with a 7% absolute increase in risk of resistance carriage (80% credible interval 3% to 11%). Interpretation of these estimates is limited by the low number of antibiotic duration trials that monitored carriage of resistant gram-negative bacteria, as an outcome, contributing to a large credible interval.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>In this study, we found both theoretical and empirical evidence that reducing antibiotic treatment duration can reduce resistance carriage, though the mechanistic models also highlighted circumstances under which reducing treatment duration can, perversely, increase resistance. Future antibiotic duration trials should monitor antibiotic-resistant bacteria colonisation as an outcome to better inform antibiotic stewardship policies.</p>\n",

       "<p>Sickleweed (<em>Falcaria vulgaris</em>) is the name of a species of annual, and perennial herbaceous plants of the genus <em>Falcaria</em>. Climate change could negatively influnces the performance of various plant species in plant kingdom. In this study, 15 different sickleweed populations from seven provinces of the country were collected based on an unbalanced nest design with 10 replications and the percentage of essential oil, types of chlorophyll, phenol, proline, protein, and carotenoids were measured on them. The results showed that there was a significant difference between populations at the level of one percent for the studied traits. The results of the mean comparison showed that populations Ard-Shaban and Qaz-Ilan in terms of the evaluated traits and especially the percentage of essential oil were at the upper of the studied samples and selected as suitable populations. In addition, populations Gilan-Deylaman and Kur-Gerger-e Sofla were also identified as superior populations in terms of studied traits by cluster analysis and principle component analysis (PCA). Since the high level of proline and biochemical and physiological traits in plants can play a role in plants’ tolerance to stresses, therefore, populations with high values of these traits can be used in stress tolerance breeding programs. Therefore, in this study, populations Gilan-Deylaman and Kur-Gerger-e Sofla can be suitable populations for this purpose. In addition, the essential oil of this plant is used in the treatment of diseases, and therefore populations Ard-Shaban and Qaz-Ilan, which showed a high percentage of essential oil, can be used in breeding programs to increase the performance of this trait.</p>\n",

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Background: </span>Self-medication counseling in community pharmacies plays a crucial role in health care. Counseling advice should therefore be evidence-based. Web-based information and databases are commonly used as electronic information sources. EVInews is a self-medication–related information tool consisting of a database and monthly published newsletters for pharmacists. Little is known about the quality of pharmacists’ electronic information sources for evidence-based self-medication counseling.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>Our aim was to investigate the quality of community pharmacists’ web-based search results for self-medication–related content in comparison with the EVInews database, based on an adjusted quality score for pharmacists.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>After receiving ethics approval, we performed a quantitative web-based survey with a search task as a prospective randomized, controlled, and unblinded trial. For the search task, participants were instructed to search for evidence-based information to verify 6 health-related statements from 2 typical self-medication indications. Pharmacists across Germany were invited via email to participate. After providing written informed consent, they were automatically, randomly assigned to use either web-based information sources of their choice without the EVInews database (web group) or exclusively the EVInews database (EVInews group). The quality of the information sources that were used for the search task was then assessed by 2 evaluators using a quality score ranging from 100% (180 points, all predefined criteria fulfilled) to 0% (0 points, none of the predefined criteria fulfilled). In case of assessment discrepancies, an expert panel consisting of 4 pharmacists was consulted.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>In total, 141 pharmacists were enrolled. In the Web group (n=71 pharmacists), the median quality score was 32.8% (59.0 out of 180.0 points; IQR 23.0-80.5). In the EVInews group (n=70 pharmacists), the median quality score was significantly higher (85.3%; 153.5 out of 180.0 points; <i>P</i>&lt;.001) and the IQR was smaller (IQR 125.1-157.0). Fewer pharmacists completed the entire search task in the Web group (n=22) than in the EVInews group (n=46). The median time to complete the search task was not significantly different between the Web group (25.4 minutes) and the EVInews group (19.7 minutes; <i>P</i>=.12). The most frequently used web-based sources (74/254, 29.1%) comprised tertiary literature.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>The median quality score of the web group was poor, and there was a significant difference in quality scores in favor of the EVInews group. Pharmacists’ web-based and self-medication–related information sources often did not meet standard quality requirements and showed considerable variation in quality.<br></p>\n",

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Background: </span>To ensure the timely diagnosis of emerging infectious diseases, high-tech molecular biotechnology is often used to detect pathogens and has gradually become the gold standard for virological testing. However, beginners and students are often unable to practice their skills due to the higher costs associated with high-level virological testing, the increasing complexity of the equipment, and the limited number of specimens from patients. Therefore, a new training program is necessary to increase training and reduce the risk of test failure.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>The aim of the study is to (1) develop and implement a virtual reality (VR) software for simulated and interactive high-level virological testing that can be applied in clinical practice and skills building or training settings and (2) evaluate the VR simulation’s effectiveness on reaction, learning, and behavior of the students (trainees).<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>Viral nucleic acid tests on a BD MAX instrument were selected for our VR project because it is a high-tech automatic detection system. There was cooperation between teachers of medical technology and biomedical engineering. Medical technology teachers were responsible for designing the lesson plan, and the biomedical engineering personnel developed the VR software. We designed a novel VR teaching software to simulate cognitive learning via various procedure scenarios and interactive models. The VR software contains 2D VR “cognitive test and learning” lessons and 3D VR “practical skills training” lessons. We evaluated students’ learning effectiveness pre- and posttraining and then recorded their behavior patterns when answering questions, performing repeated exercises, and engaging in clinical practice.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>The results showed that the use of the VR software met participants’ needs and enhanced their interest in learning. The average posttraining scores of participants exposed to 2D and 3D VR training were significantly higher than participants who were exposed solely to traditional demonstration teaching (<i>P</i>&lt;.001). Behavioral assessments of students pre- and posttraining showed that students exposed to VR-based training to acquire relevant knowledge of advanced virological testing exhibited significantly improved knowledge of specific items posttraining (<i>P</i>&lt;.01). A higher participant score led to fewer attempts when responding to each item in a matching task. Thus, VR can enhance students’ understanding of difficult topics.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>The VR program designed for this study can reduce the costs associated with virological testing training, thus, increasing their accessibility for students and beginners. It can also reduce the risk of viral infections particularly during disease outbreaks (eg, the COVID-19 pandemic) and also enhance students’ learning motivation to strengthen their practical skills.<br></p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-13\">Hand hygiene, including handwashing with soap and other methods such as alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHRs), is an important public health measure that can prevent the transmission of a range of diseases.<a id=\"xref-ref-1-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-1\">1</a> Handwashing with soap has been found to be a cost-effective intervention<a id=\"xref-ref-2-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-2\">2</a> that can reduce the risk of both diarrhoeal disease and acute respiratory infections by over 20%.<a id=\"xref-ref-3-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-3\">3–9</a> Handwashing with soap has also been linked to the reduction of certain neglected tropical diseases, including trachoma and some soil-transmitted helminth infections.<a id=\"xref-ref-10-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-10\">10 11</a> Recently, handwashing with soap and the use of ABHRs were advised as one of the key control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic<a id=\"xref-ref-12-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12 13</a> and were found to be effective.<a id=\"xref-ref-14-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-14\">14</a>\n",
       "</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-14\">This scoping review focuses on hand hygiene in non-healthcare settings, which we collectively refer to as ‘community settings’. Using the definition set out in the Ottawa Charter, we consider settings as where ‘health is created and lived by people within the settings of their everyday life; where they learn, work, play and love’,<a id=\"xref-ref-15-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-15\">15</a> and include domestic, public and institutional settings. The practice of hand hygiene—and access to the facilities which enable this—is often limited in these community settings, particularly in low/middle-income countries.<a id=\"xref-ref-16-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-16\">16</a> In the domestic setting, 30% of the global population does not have access to a basic handwashing facility with soap and water at home,<a id=\"xref-ref-17-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-17\">17 18</a> with three-quarters of those living in low-income countries.<a id=\"xref-ref-17-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-17\">17</a> In institutional settings, an estimated 43% of schools worldwide do not have access to basic hand hygiene facilities,<a id=\"xref-ref-18-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-18\">18</a> but there are limited data for other institutional settings, such as the workplace and prisons and places of detention, and public settings, such as markets, transportation hubs, and places of worship.<a id=\"xref-ref-18-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-18\">18</a>\n",
       "</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-15\">Despite the international recognition of hand hygiene as a critical public health measure, a recent global assessment of government policies, planning and financing for hygiene found that while the majority of surveyed countries reported having national policies for hand hygiene, less than 10% had sufficient financing to implement them.<a id=\"xref-ref-19-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-19\">19</a> Various international guidelines with recommendations on hand hygiene for non-healthcare settings exist,<a id=\"xref-ref-13-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-13\">13 20–22</a> but it is unclear whether current international guidelines are comprehensive, consistent and based on the most rigorous evidence available. This review aims to summarise current international recommendations for hand hygiene in community settings, identify areas of consistency and concordance, and assess whether recommendations are evidence based.</p>\n",
       "<h2 class=\"\">Methods</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-16\">This review follows the six stages of the Arksey and O’Malley methodological framework for scoping reviews.<a id=\"xref-ref-23-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-23\">23–25</a> Expert consultation (stage 6) was integrated throughout the scoping review process<a id=\"xref-ref-24-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-24\">24</a> to obtain feedback on the scope and conceptual framework and to identify any additional guidelines beyond those identified during the electronic search. Our review is described according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR)<a id=\"xref-ref-26-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-26\">26</a> and a PRISMA-ScR checklist is included in the <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-1\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental table A1</a>.

       "<h3 class=\"\">Supplemental material</h3>\n",
       "<h3>Identifying the research question (stage 1)</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-18\">To identify and refine the research question, a conceptual framework was developed for this review and built around three key concepts: (1) hand hygiene, (2) non-healthcare settings and (3) current international guidelines (<a id=\"xref-fig-1-1\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F1\">figure 1</a>). In this review, we define hand hygiene as any action of hand cleansing for the purpose of removing or deactivating pathogens from hands.<a id=\"xref-ref-28-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28</a> Effective hand hygiene is defined as any practice which removes or deactivates pathogens from hands and thereby limits disease transmission.<a id=\"xref-ref-28-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28</a>\n",
       "</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-19\" class=\"first-child\">Conceptual framework for hand hygiene in community settings.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-20\">The first key concept in the conceptual framework—hand hygiene—covers four areas: effective hand hygiene, minimum requirements, behaviour change and government measures (<a id=\"xref-fig-1-2\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F1\">figure 1</a>). Effective hand hygiene refers to definitions and practices. Minimum requirements refer to the materials, services and infrastructure required for effective hand hygiene. Behaviour change denotes the appropriate behavioural performances that promote and sustain effective hand hygiene. Government measures concern actions taken by governments to ensure effective hand hygiene, which are categorised according to an established framework<a id=\"xref-ref-29-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-29\">29</a> as follows: policy and strategy; institutional arrangements; sector financing; planning, monitoring and review; capacity development; and equity.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-21\">The second key concept—community settings—is defined as settings where healthcare is not routinely delivered,<a id=\"xref-ref-28-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28</a> broadly spanning all places where people ‘learn, play, work and love’<a id=\"xref-ref-15-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-15\">15</a> and specifically including domestic, public and institutional settings. As these settings may not exclusively refer to physical settings,<a id=\"xref-ref-30-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30</a> the review also includes recommendations for vulnerable populations (eg, people experiencing homelessness) who may reside permanently or semipermanently in public spaces. Nursing homes, long-term care facilities, non-acute care facilities and home care are also included in the review under institutional settings, as the boundary between healthcare and non-healthcare settings is often unclear or recommendations for these subsettings may not be disaggregated, especially in the context of COVID-19 where people received care at home.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-22\">The third concept—guideline—is defined as a published document where the primary purpose is to provide specific guidance, in the form of recommendations, towards a course of action. A recommendation is defined as a statement designed to assist a targeted actor to make an informed decision on whether, when and how to undertake a specific action.<a id=\"xref-ref-31-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-31\">31</a> Our review is limited to international guidelines to identify generalisable recommendations of global relevance.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Identifying relevant studies (stage 2)</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-23\">To identify relevant guidelines, the search strategy consisted of the following sources: (1) the WHO Institutional Repository for Information Sharing (IRIS) Database, (2) Google search engine, (3) websites of international organisations known to work on hand hygiene (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-2\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental file 1</a>) and (4) contacting experts. We searched the WHO IRIS Database using prespecified search terms related to hand hygiene, non-healthcare settings and guidelines (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-3\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental table A3</a>). The search in Google was carried out using the anonymous function in the web browser (Chrome) to reduce the influence of the reviewer’s (CM) individual search history. Search strings were constructed by using multiple combinations of search terms from <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-4\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental table A3</a>. The first 10 pages of Google were reviewed by one reviewer (CM). Documents that at first appeared related to the research question and met the inclusion criteria were included for further screening. Expert consultations were conducted with ‘Hand Hygiene for All’ Initiative core partners (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-5\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental table A4</a>) to identify potentially relevant guidelines. The reference lists of guidelines were also hand-searched for any additional relevant documents. The search was limited to English and French languages and publication date was restricted to 1 January 1990 onwards to identify current guidelines.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Study selection (stage 3)</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-24\">Documents meeting the following criteria were included: (1) international guideline, (2) offers one or more recommendations on hand hygiene, (3) targets at least one community setting, as defined in the conceptual framework, (4) published by an international non-governmental organisation (NGO), multilateral agency or public health agency, (5) published in English or French, and (6) published between 1 January 1990 and 15 November 2021. The review excludes guidelines for humanitarian settings, as internationally agreed guidance on hand hygiene in humanitarian settings and complex emergencies is available through the Sphere standards for water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) promotion.<a id=\"xref-ref-32-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32</a> Only the most recent versions of guidelines were included, with previous versions of the same guidelines excluded. Country-specific guidelines were also excluded.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-25\">All documents retrieved from electronic searches and expert consultations were transferred to Mendeley<a id=\"xref-ref-33-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-33\">33</a> for de-duplication. Inclusion was completed in two stages: (1) title and abstracts were screened for eligibility by one reviewer (CM); and (2) full texts of all potentially eligible documents were retrieved and independently assessed for inclusion by two reviewers (CM and LB). Disagreement between reviewers on inclusion was resolved through arbitration by a third reviewer (OC).</p>\n",
       "<h3>Charting the data (stage 4)</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-26\">Guideline characteristics and recommendations from included guidelines were double-extracted by two reviewers (CM and LB) using a standardised data extraction template in MS Excel<a id=\"xref-ref-34-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-34\">34</a> and then cross-checked for accuracy. As with inclusion, a third reviewer (OC) provided arbitration if agreement on extraction could not be reached. The data extraction form (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-6\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental table A5</a>) included information on guideline characteristics, such as author, year of publication, target setting and COVID-19 response, as well as 57 specific parameters related to the four areas of hand hygiene described in the conceptual framework (<a id=\"xref-fig-1-3\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F1\">figure 1</a>). Recommendations for each parameter were extracted from included guidelines where possible.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Collating, summarising and reporting the results (stage 5)</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-27\">Guideline recommendations were first summarised for each parameter across community settings and then disaggregated by domestic, public or institutional setting where relevant. Definitions and recommendations for hand hygiene were assessed for consistency, concordance and whether supported by cited evidence. Recommendations were classified as consistent, fairly consistent or inconsistent if they featured in 10 or more, 4–9 or less than 4 guidelines, respectively. Concordance is here defined as parameters with no consistent or fairly consistent recommendations at odds with each other. We also used a hierarchical system to classify evidence cited for recommendations into five levels, adapted according to an established classification system<a id=\"xref-ref-35-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-35\">35</a>: (1) systematic review or meta-analysis, (2) randomised controlled trial or controlled trial without randomisation (eg, quasi-experimental), (3) guideline (either developed from systematic reviews or not developed from systematic reviews), (4) observational study (eg, cohort, cross-sectional, case–control studies), and (5) expert opinion or anecdotal information (eg, programme documentation). A recommendation was considered evidence based if the guideline provided a specific citation for the recommendation, which was coded according to the level of evidence cited. Finally, evidence gaps were defined as parameters with very few recommendations (ie, less than 10 recommendations, equivalent to less than 20% of guidelines providing a recommendation).</p>\n",

       "<h3>Description of included guidelines</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-31\">The 51 included guidelines were published in English between 1999 and 2021, with 38 published in 2020 or later and 31 providing guidance specifically on hand hygiene to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19. Among the 51 included guidelines, 67% are published by multilateral agencies (WHO, UNICEF, United Nations High Comissioner for Refugees and International Labour Organization), 23% by international NGOs, and 10% by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-9\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental table A7</a>). Most guidelines target public and institutional settings, while none exclusively target the domestic setting. More specifically, 43% (n=22) target the public setting, 43% (n=22) the institutional setting, 4% (n=2) the domestic and public setting, and 10% (n=5) more than one setting (eg, domestic, public and/or institutional). Of the 22 guidelines for the public setting, 20 concern public spaces and 2 concern vulnerable populations within public spaces (eg, people experiencing unsheltered homelessness and people living in dense, informal settlements). For institutional settings, eight guidelines concern schools, six the workplace, four prisons and places of detention, three places of worship, and one long-term care facilities and home care. Almost no guidelines, however, define a community setting. The majority of recommendations are generalisable to high-income, medium-income and low-income settings. Overall, we extracted 923 recommendations from the 51 included guidelines (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-10\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental table A8</a>).</p>\n",
       "<h3>Recommendations for effective hand hygiene</h3>\n",
       "<h4>Hand hygiene definitions</h4>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-32\">Only 10% of guidelines provide a clear definition for hand hygiene or safe or effective hand hygiene.<a id=\"xref-ref-36-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-36\">36–40</a> Meanwhile, 75% of guidelines provide at least one recommendation on when to practise hand hygiene, referred to in our review as a ‘key moment’. Guidelines use inconsistent terms for defining when to practise hand hygiene, such as ‘key times’ (14%),<a id=\"xref-ref-37-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-37\">37 41–46</a> ‘critical times’ (8%)<a id=\"xref-ref-47-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-47\">47–50</a> and ‘key moments’ (4%).<a id=\"xref-ref-21-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-21\">21 51</a> Otherwise, guidelines either do not use a specific term for defining a key moment (49%) or do not recommend at least one key moment (25%).</p>\n",
       "<h4>Hand hygiene practices</h4>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-33\">There is agreement among guidelines on what constitutes effective hand hygiene across community settings, although there are gaps in recommendations on how to practise effective hand hygiene. Almost all guidelines (90%) recommend washing hands with soap and for the duration of at least 20 s (27%) (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-1\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>). In addition, 63% of guidelines recommend the use of ABHR as an alternative or complement to handwashing with soap, though very few guidelines recommend duration for hand rubbing. There is a lack of recommendations on handwashing or hand rubbing technique (16%),<a id=\"xref-ref-21-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-21\">21 40–42 47 52–54</a> with two of these guidelines (25%, n=2)<a id=\"xref-ref-21-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-21\">21 40</a> referring to the WHO instructions for hand hygiene in healthcare settings.<a id=\"xref-ref-28-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28</a> Meanwhile, 24% of guidelines recommend the inclusion or provision of simple instructions on handwashing technique in hygiene promotion programmes, yet none of these guidelines include specific steps on handwashing or hand rubbing technique.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-34\" class=\"first-child\">Consistent and fairly consistent recommendations for hand hygiene in community settings</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-37\">Guidelines provide inconsistent recommendations on when to practise hand hygiene. Over 30 different individual key moments are recommended among the guidelines. Despite this inconsistency, the individual key moments most commonly mentioned include ‘before and after eating’, ‘after using the toilet’, ‘before and after preparing food’, ‘after blowing nose, coughing or sneezing’, and ‘after touching public surfaces or objects’ (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-2\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>). The latter two feature most commonly among guidelines published during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fairly consistently recommended individual key moments include ‘when entering or exiting the home or public space’, ‘after changing a child’s diaper’ and ‘when hands are visibly dirty’. Almost all guidelines recommend clusters of key moments (ie, individual key moments recommended together). The most common ones are ‘after using the toilet’ with ‘before and after eating’ (39%, n=20); ‘after using the toilet’ with ‘before and after preparing food’ (24%, n=12); and ‘after using the toilet’ with ‘before and after eating’, and ‘after blowing nose, coughing or sneezing’ (22%, n=11).</p>\n",
       "<h3>Recommendations for minimum requirements</h3>\n",
       "<h4>Handwashing materials</h4>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-38\">Guidelines consistently recommend plain soap for handwashing across all community settings and paper towels or electric dryers for hand drying in public and institutional settings. Most guidelines (65%) do not recommend a specific type of soap for handwashing, though some specifically recommend bar soap (24%), liquid soap (22%) or ‘soapy water’ (eg, home-made mixture of powder or liquid soap, or bar soap shavings diluted in water) (16%) (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-3\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>). No guidelines specifically recommend antibacterial soap. For hand drying after handwashing, most guidelines recommend clean, single-use paper towels (39%) and electric air-drying systems (22%) in public and institutional settings. Eight per cent of guidelines recommend a bin with disposal liners and lid for the waste management of paper towels in public and institutional settings.<a id=\"xref-ref-21-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-21\">21 55–57</a> No guidelines provide a recommendation for hand drying materials in the domestic setting.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Soap and water requirements for handwashing</h4>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-39\">While guidelines consistently recommend running water for handwashing with soap, there are gaps for soap and water quantity and discordant recommendations on water quality for handwashing. For water services, almost half (43%) of guidelines recommend running water, 16% a piped water system connected to a tap, and 14% water trucking, storage or manual refilling. Few guidelines recommend a minimum quantity of liquid or bar soap (14%)<a id=\"xref-ref-43-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-43\">43 48 58–61</a> or water (18%)<a id=\"xref-ref-12-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12 20 47 50 60–62</a> required for handwashing (eg, minimum amount of water needed to wet hands or soap product necessary to cover all surfaces of hands for handwashing with soap) (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-2-1\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T2\">table 2</a>). One guideline, for example, recommends less than 5 mL of liquid soap per person per handwashing event,<a id=\"xref-ref-60-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-60\">60</a> whereas three other guidelines recommend at least 250 g of bar soap per person per month for handwashing.<a id=\"xref-ref-43-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-43\">43 48 61</a> For water quality, 16% of guidelines state that water must be of drinking water quality, in line with WHO guidelines.<a id=\"xref-ref-21-5\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-21\">21 40 41 52 54 63–66</a> In contrast, 8% state that it does not have to be of drinking water quality,<a id=\"xref-ref-12-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12 20 39 67</a> though none specify a quantitative standard nor whether non-drinking quality water may conditionally be used if high-quality water is not available. In addition, 10% of guidelines recommend that free residual chlorine must be greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/L after at least 30 min of contact time.<a id=\"xref-ref-43-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-43\">43 48 63 68 69</a>\n",
       "</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-40\" class=\"first-child\">Parameters with gaps in recommendations (ie, fewer than 10 recommendations, equivalent to less than 20% of guidelines providing a recommendation)</p>\n",
       "<h4>Alternative materials for hand hygiene</h4>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-42\">There are consistent recommendations for ABHR as an alternative material for hand hygiene. Of the guidelines that recommend ABHR, 35% (n=18) recommend ABHR with at least 60% alcohol, 22% (n=11) do not specify an alcohol percentage and only 6% (n=3) recommend an alcohol percentage of at least 70%. In addition, 18% of guidelines recommend ABHR where soap and water are not available<a id=\"xref-ref-37-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-37\">37–39 41 42 52–54 70</a> and 10% (n=5) only if hands are not visibly soiled.<a id=\"xref-ref-21-6\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-21\">21 36 40 65 71</a>\n",
       "</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-43\">There are discordant recommendations for the use of ash. Twenty-two per cent of guidelines recommend ash as an alternative material to soap for handwashing.<a id=\"xref-ref-12-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12 36 43 45 47 52 64 65 71–73</a> In addition, 14% recommend ash if ABHR or soap is not available.<a id=\"xref-ref-12-5\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12 43 45 47 52 64 73</a> However, 6% (n=3) of guidelines advise against the use of ash or other products, such as soil, sand, mud or water alone.<a id=\"xref-ref-45-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-45\">45 47 62</a> In addition, while some guidelines (8%) recommend 0.05% chlorine solution,<a id=\"xref-ref-48-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-48\">48 53 54 63</a> one guideline advises against it.<a id=\"xref-ref-13-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-13\">13</a>\n",
       "</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-44\">When disaggregated by setting, ABHR is most consistently recommended in public and institutional settings where it may meet larger and more frequent demand than handwashing stations. Similarly, recommendations for the conditional use of ABHR where soap and water are not available feature the most in the institutional setting, particularly in the workplace and schools. Ash is most commonly recommended in the public setting, which includes low-resource and water-scarce settings where soap and water may not be available.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Hand hygiene stations</h4>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-45\">Overall, there are inconsistent recommendations on hand hygiene facilities and their location, as well as gaps. Across all settings, guidelines recommend washbasins (eg, ceramic, cement or plastic) (16%), a bucket or container connected to tap (14%) and tippy taps (12%) for handwashing stations (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-4\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>). Guidelines specify 16 different locations for handwashing stations, which include by the entrance and exit of public spaces and buildings (eg, restaurants, shops, markets, places of worship, train and bus stations) (27%), in close proximity to toilets (27%), and next to food preparation and eating areas (18%). Guidelines also mention placing hand hygiene stations, such as ABHR dispensers, at key entry and exit points of public spaces and buildings (14%). There are inconsistent recommendations on the optimal spacing and number of users per handwashing station, whereas none for ABHR dispensers. Gaps in recommendations include those for hand hygiene materials and product supply chains, cost and affordability, functionality, durability, and hand hygiene station operation and maintenance responsibilities and actions (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-2-2\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T2\">table 2</a>).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-46\">Recommendations on the location of handwashing stations vary slightly by setting. Close proximity to toilets is consistently recommended for both public and institutional settings (10% and 14%, respectively). By the entrance and exit of public spaces is most consistently recommended for public settings (24%). Next to food preparation and eating areas is most consistently recommended for institutional settings (12%), such as schools and the workplace.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Hand hygiene station access and adaptations</h4>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-47\">Guidelines recommend hand hygiene stations that are accessible for all and adapted for pandemic response. For example, 10% of guidelines recommend that the height of soap and water taps be appropriate for access by children, the elderly and disabled (eg, 500–700 mm basin height for children and 850 mm basin height for wheelchair access) (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-5\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>). Forty-five per cent (n=23) of guidelines recommend COVID-19-related adaptations for hand hygiene stations, such as taps that limit cross-contamination (16%), 1–2 m spacing between stations (12%), regular tap disinfection (10%), and towels for opening and closing taps (8%). Other adaptations include theft resistance (eg, attaching soap or other movable pieces to the station) (16%) and water-saving designs (eg, low-flow faucets) (12%).</p>\n",
       "<h3>Recommendations for behaviour change</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-48\">Overall, there are few recommendations related to hand hygiene behaviour change, though there are consistent recommendations on behaviour change messaging and delivery channels. For behaviour change messaging, some guidelines (10%) recommend messages that target ‘motives’<a id=\"xref-ref-74-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-74\">74</a> (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-6\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>).<a id=\"xref-ref-20-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-20\">20 45 54 64 71</a> In terms of delivery channels, 31% of guidelines recommend using visual reminders (eg, signs, posters or leaflets) and 24% mass communication (eg, radio, social media or mobile phone text messaging) to deliver behaviour change messages. Prompts, cues and habit formation are fairly consistently recommended as behaviour change techniques.<a id=\"xref-ref-20-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-20\">20 39 52 67 71 75–78</a> Formative research for behaviour change programmes is recommended by 10% (n=5) of guidelines,<a id=\"xref-ref-46-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-46\">46 47 49 72 76</a> though only 8% (n=4) specifically mention undertaking formative research to identify behavioural determinants among the target population.<a id=\"xref-ref-46-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-46\">46 47 49 72</a> Guidelines provide inconsistent recommendations on behaviour change approaches (18%), determinants of hand hygiene to target for interventions (22%), and behaviour change models or frameworks (33%). Lastly, there are gaps in recommendations on frequency of behaviour change interventions (ie, how often an intervention should be delivered) and behaviour change approaches (4%)<a id=\"xref-ref-20-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-20\">20 46</a> (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-2-3\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T2\">table 2</a>).</p>\n",
       "<h3>Recommendations for government measures</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-49\">Overall, few guidelines (22%, n=11) provide a recommendation on government measures. Nonetheless, recommendations for sector policy and strategy include promoting local soap production and fostering public–private partnerships for handwashing (4%).<a id=\"xref-ref-47-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-47\">47 49</a> For institutional arrangements, 4% of guidelines suggest identifying ways of cross-sectoral collaboration for hand hygiene,<a id=\"xref-ref-20-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-20\">20 49</a> while other recommendations centre on engaging communities, the private sector and civil society for the delivery of WASH services.<a id=\"xref-ref-12-6\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12 65</a> On planning, monitoring and review, 4% of guidelines recommend supporting or reinforcing existing monitoring systems or creating a government-led national monitoring system, in line with global hygiene indicators.<a id=\"xref-ref-49-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-49\">49 68</a>\n",
       "</p>\n",
       "<h3>Evidence-based recommendations</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-50\">Of the 923 recommendations extracted from the 51 included guidelines, most (93%) do not have a citation for one of the five levels of evidence identified for the review (ie, systematic review, randomised and quasi-randomised trial, guideline, observational study or anecdotal information) (<a id=\"xref-fig-3-1\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F3\">figure 3</a>). Of the remaining 7% of recommendations, less than 1% cite evidence from a systematic review.<a id=\"xref-ref-46-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-46\">46</a> In addition, less than 1% cite evidence from a randomised or quasi-randomised trial,<a id=\"xref-ref-12-7\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12 36</a> while over 1% cite evidence from observational studies, which are mainly recommendations for alternative hand hygiene materials, such as ash, sand and soil, or alternative water sources for handwashing, such as cooking or laundry water, bathwater and seawater.<a id=\"xref-ref-12-8\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12 36 47</a> Less than 1% of recommendations cite other guidelines developed from systematic reviews,<a id=\"xref-ref-21-7\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-21\">21 47 67 70</a> while 2.5% cite other guidelines not developed from systematic reviews,<a id=\"xref-ref-51-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-51\">51 56 57 65 71 78 79</a> such as WHO interim guidelines for hand hygiene in the context of COVID-19.<a id=\"xref-ref-51-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-51\">51 56 57 65 71 78 79</a> The other 2% of recommendations cite anecdotal information, such as programme documentation.<a id=\"xref-ref-45-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-45\">45 47 62 76</a>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-52\">We identified 51 guidelines published between 1999 and 2021 by various international agencies covering a range of community settings. Most guidelines target the public and institutional settings, while surprisingly none exclusively target the domestic setting. Overall, community settings are not clearly defined among the guidelines, which presents an opportunity for future normative guidelines to establish a clear and common definition, especially as it relates to hand hygiene. Overall, no guidelines comprehensively address hand hygiene across domestic, public and institutional settings, and very few recommendations are evidence based, highlighting a gap in global normative guidance on hand hygiene in community settings.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Effective hand hygiene</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-53\">There is agreement among guidelines on what constitutes effective hand hygiene; however, inconsistencies and gaps remain as to when and how to practise hand hygiene. Current recommendations for handwashing with soap reflect findings from published literature, which show that handwashing with soap is an effective means for preventing the transmission of a range of diseases.<a id=\"xref-ref-3-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-3\">3–9</a> Regarding when to practise hand hygiene, future guidelines could focus key moments on those most likely to interrupt the transmission of infectious diseases in domestic, public and institutional settings. These might include ‘after using the toilet’ to reduce the transmission of diarrhoea-causing pathogens,<a id=\"xref-ref-9-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-9\">9</a> and ‘after touching high-contact surfaces’ or ‘after coughing or sneezing’ to reduce the risk of respiratory infections.<a id=\"xref-ref-3-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-3\">3</a> Lastly, gaps in recommendations on handwashing and hand rubbing technique present an opportunity for future guidelines to recommend the optimal technique for reducing bacterial load on hands.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Minimum requirements</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-54\">Consistent recommendations for the use of soap and water and ABHR suggest the widespread acceptability of these materials for effective hand hygiene across community settings. Current recommendations for the use of plain soap are consistent with findings from a systematic review that suggest that plain soap is more effective than antibacterial soap at removing or inactivating pathogens on hands in community settings.<a id=\"xref-ref-80-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-80\">80</a> Recommendations for running water are equally relevant as unreliable water supply negatively affects households’ ability to perform hand hygiene.<a id=\"xref-ref-81-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-81\">81</a> Gaps in recommendations on minimum quantities of soap and water required for effective hand hygiene are also important for future guidelines to address. The recommended use of ABHR with at least 60% alcohol is in line with several studies which have found that ABHRs with an alcohol concentration between 60% and 80% are more effective at killing germs than those with a lower alcohol percentage, particularly in clinical settings.<a id=\"xref-ref-82-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-82\">82 83</a> Although ABHR can still inactivate many types of microbes when used correctly, evidence suggests that soap and running water are still more effective at removing certain types of pathogens that may be present on hands.<a id=\"xref-ref-1-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-1\">1</a> The WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care, for example, recommend ABHR as the preferred method for routine hand hygiene in healthcare settings when hands are not visibly soiled, as it enables more frequent hand hygiene.<a id=\"xref-ref-28-5\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28</a> Similarly, in community settings, ABHR may be suitable in contexts where frequent hand hygiene is necessary, such as transport hubs and entrances or exits to public spaces and buildings.<a id=\"xref-ref-84-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-84\">84</a> ABHR may also be favourable where frequent hand hygiene is required, as the repeated use of soap can result in skin dryness and cause chronic irritant contact dermatitis.<a id=\"xref-ref-28-6\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28</a> However, in certain domestic, public and institutional settings, such as the household or schools, where hands may become more soiled, ABHR may be less likely to effectively inactivate microbes.<a id=\"xref-ref-82-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-82\">82 83</a> As per current international guideline recommendations, handwashing with soap may therefore be prioritised in these settings, with ABHR as a suitable complement or alternative where frequent hand hygiene is required. Finally, because the transmission of germs is more likely to occur to and from wet hands, hand drying is an essential component of effective hand hygiene, especially for handwashing.<a id=\"xref-ref-85-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-85\">85</a> Current recommendations for hand drying in public and institutional settings are consistent with those in the WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care, which recommend that hands should ideally be dried with individual paper towels, otherwise with air dryers.<a id=\"xref-ref-28-7\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28</a> While there is mixed evidence for the most effective hand drying method,<a id=\"xref-ref-86-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-86\">86</a> the WHO recommendations are based on findings that suggest that paper towels may effectively prevent recontamination of hands, while also lowering the risk of spreading pathogens through the air compared with electric air dryers.<a id=\"xref-ref-85-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-85\">85</a>\n",
       "</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-55\">Discordant recommendations for minimum requirements suggest the need to leverage further research to determine the optimal water quality for handwashing and effectiveness of alternative materials for hand hygiene where soap and ABHR are not widely available. Limited evidence suggests that the use of non-potable water with low-to-moderate levels of <em>Escherichia coli</em> contamination may still be effective for handwashing,<a id=\"xref-ref-87-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-87\">87</a> which may be promising for areas where it is difficult to regularly treat water or where there is intermittent water supply that is prone to contamination. Similarly, two studies found that drinkable water may not be needed for handwashing with soap.<a id=\"xref-ref-88-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-88\">88 89</a> Nevertheless, the WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care recommend washing hands with clean, running water whenever possible.<a id=\"xref-ref-28-8\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28</a> While there are discordant recommendations for the use of ash, there is uncertain evidence whether this stops or reduces the spread of pathogens compared with hand cleansing with soap, mud, soil or no hand cleansing.<a id=\"xref-ref-90-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-90\">90</a> Future guidelines may consider the efficacy of hand hygiene products along with their availability and acceptability in domestic, public and institutional settings to make relevant recommendations, particularly in water-scarce regions or settings where there is limited access to soap or ABHR. For example, soapy water may be a promising low-cost and effective alternative to bar soap in settings where bar or liquid soap is unaffordable.<a id=\"xref-ref-91-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-91\">91</a> In addition, one interim guideline on hand hygiene practices in low-resource settings, for example, recommends the use of friction-generating materials where clean, running water, soap or ABHR is not available.<a id=\"xref-ref-36-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-36\">36</a>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-56\">Current inconsistent recommendations for hand hygiene facilities and their placement may limit the practice of effective hand hygiene. Sustaining hand hygiene behaviour change requires consistent access to functional hand hygiene stations at key locations,<a id=\"xref-ref-92-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-92\">92 93</a> and diverse infrastructure is recommended with varying costs. Nonetheless, the appropriateness of these recommendations is likely to depend on the local availability and affordability of materials. One guideline, for example, provides technical recommendations for permanent and semipermanent handwashing facilities in public places and buildings, focusing on the sustainability and equitable access of these facilities.<a id=\"xref-ref-20-5\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-20\">20</a> Similarly, future guidelines may prioritise the accessibility, affordability, and sustainability of materials and infrastructure for hand hygiene across all community settings to address current inconsistent and discordant recommendations. The accessibility and sustainability of hand hygiene stations are particularly important to ensure that they are inclusive and kept functional and well stocked beyond their installation.<a id=\"xref-ref-20-6\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-20\">20</a>\n",
       "</p>\n",
       "<h3>Behaviour change</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-57\">The gaps in recommendations related to behaviour change suggest the need for guidance based on established behavioural theory and existing evidence. There are some recommendations for behaviour change, though without clear steps on how to develop, implement and sustain hand hygiene behaviour change interventions. Future guidelines may benefit from leveraging well-established behavioural frameworks and theories<a id=\"xref-ref-94-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-94\">94–96</a> to make recommendations as to how to develop effective, locally appropriate strategies beyond information-focused communication. In addition, while most behaviour change theories and frameworks recommended among the guidelines note the importance of formative research, very few guidelines recommend undertaking formative research. Yet, formative research plays a key role in adapting hand hygiene behaviour change programmes to high-risk populations and target settings.<a id=\"xref-ref-97-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-97\">97</a>\n",
       "</p>\n",
       "<h3>Government measures</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-58\">The significant gaps in recommendations on government measures underscore the current lack of normative standards to guide national governments on the planning, delivery, financing and monitoring of effective hand hygiene. Indicators also suggest inadequate planning and insufficient funding for hand hygiene among national governments globally.<a id=\"xref-ref-19-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-19\">19</a> Future guidelines may therefore consider prioritising government measures to support countries in responding to and preventing public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Future guidelines may also focus recommendations on hand hygiene monitoring and reporting to improve comparison of hand hygiene indicators within and between countries.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Strengths and limitations</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-59\">This review has four main limitations. First, as a scoping review, we did not systematically assess the quality of the included guidelines, although we did, for example, consider aspects such as the extent to which recommendations were based on cited evidence. In addition, included guidelines covered WASH and public health topics beyond hand hygiene, so it was thus not necessarily relevant to assess the whole guidelines for quality, but rather focus on the robustness of the specific recommendations for hand hygiene. Second, the search was limited to guidelines published in English or French and therefore may have excluded relevant guidelines published in other languages. Third, the lack of recommendations for government measures among current international guidelines may not reflect an absolute absence of guidance in this area. Guidance to governments on how to improve uptake of hand hygiene practices in community settings may be included in other sector documents or policy instruments. Fourth, while recommendations were summarised across domestic, public and institutional settings, there were often too few recommendations for each setting to assess consistency and concordance. Still, with 51 guidelines providing over 900 recommendations for hand hygiene in community settings, findings from this review highlight significant gaps and inconsistencies across community settings that future guidelines may seek to prioritise.</p>\n",
       "<h2 class=\"\">Conclusion</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-60\">This review identified 51 current international guidelines providing 923 recommendations for hand hygiene in community settings. Nonetheless, there are several important areas of discordance and significant gaps in the recommendations among these guidelines. Furthermore, very few recommendations are supported by any qualifying evidence. The COVID-19 pandemic led to numerous national, regional and international efforts to improve effective hand hygiene in domestic, public and institutional settings, such as households, public spaces, workplaces and schools, but the lack of clear recommendations supported by cited evidence may limit progress in this important area of public health.</p>\n",

       "<h2 class=\"\">Introduction</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-14\">Women can experience physical or psychological symptoms during the menopause transition, including vasomotor symptoms (VMS), genitourinary effects, mood changes, muscle and joint pain, sleep disturbances and decreased libido.<a id=\"xref-ref-1-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-1\">1</a> Up to 80% of women will experience one or more menopause-related symptoms, which may impact quality of life.<a id=\"xref-ref-1-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-1\">1 2</a> Symptoms can appear prior to the final menstrual period and last into postmenopause, with the median duration of VMS reported to be 7.4 years.<a id=\"xref-ref-3-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-3\">3</a> Management of menopause symptoms includes lifestyle changes, menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), non-hormonal prescription medications or complementary therapies. Current guidelines recommend MHT as first-line treatment for bothersome VMS.<a id=\"xref-ref-4-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-4\">4 5</a> MHT is considered a safe option for women without MHT contraindications, and who are less than 60 years of age or less than 10 years since their final menstrual period.<a id=\"xref-ref-4-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-4\">4 5</a> However, some women may be fearful of using MHT to control their menopausal symptoms and may opt for alternative options they perceive to be safer.<a id=\"xref-ref-6-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-6\">6</a> Unfortunately, after the initial findings of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) that oestrogen plus progestin therapy (specifically with the combination of conjugated equine oestrogen and medroxyprogesterone) increased the risk of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer, the use of MHT declined worldwide as many women were afraid to use MHT due to safety concerns.<a id=\"xref-ref-7-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-7\">7 8</a> Even though subsequent WHI publications have shown more favourable outcomes and current guidelines support the safety of MHT in symptomatic women without contraindications, this fear may still influence women to turn to other options which they perceive as less risk.<a id=\"xref-ref-4-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-4\">4 5</a> For example, cannabis is being publicly marketed as a panacea for many health issues, including symptoms overlapping with menopause, potentially influencing decisions made regarding its use.<a id=\"xref-ref-9-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-9\">9</a> A recent systematic review identified a lack of research on the effect of cannabis on menopausal symptoms.<a id=\"xref-ref-10-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-10\">10</a> The increasing anecdotal use of cannabis for menopause symptoms demands more attention.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-15\">In Canada, medical cannabis has been legal since 2001 and recreational cannabis was legalised in 2018. Cannabis, alternatively known as marijuana, is available for purchase in Canada and includes different strains of components such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) content in many forms, such as for smoking, vaping, edibles or oils.<a id=\"xref-ref-11-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-11\">11</a> Health Canada reports likely half of Canadians have used cannabis at some point in their lives.<a id=\"xref-ref-12-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12</a> Since legalisation, cannabis use has increased especially in the midlife population.<a id=\"xref-ref-13-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-13\">13</a> Additionally, a report showed over 800 000 Canadians are now using non-medical cannabis for the management of their health, without medical advice.<a id=\"xref-ref-14-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-14\">14</a> It is still unclear how many midlife women are currently using cannabis or are interested in the use of cannabis to self-manage their symptoms. We need to engage with women to understand if and how cannabis is being used for menopause symptoms and what forms women are preferring to use. This study is an essential preliminary step to inform future research studies assessing use of cannabis for menopause symptoms. The objective of the current study was to characterise the use patterns and perceptions of cannabis specifically for menopause in a population of women aged 35 and over.</p>\n",
       "<h2 class=\"\">Methods</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Study design</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-16\">This was a cross-sectional, web-based survey of adult women residing in Alberta, Canada conducted over 2 months from October to December 2020. The survey was developed for the first phase of a mixed-methods study to explore the experiences and perspectives of women with cannabis use during menopause. The survey was hosted on the Qualtrics platform. Results are reported using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist for web-based surveys.<a id=\"xref-ref-15-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-15\">15</a></p>\n",
       "<h3>Participants and recruitment</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-17\">The inclusion criteria were women, ages 35 years and over, living in Alberta and able to complete an online survey in English. Women were recruited through research-specific social media pages on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Targeted advertisement campaigns or user-shared public social media posts were used to advertise the survey link and offer women the opportunity to participate. Participants interested in study participation clicked the advertisement or post and were directed to the open access survey in two ways. This included a direct URL link into Qualtrics from a social media post on study recruitment, or through a targeted advertisement for a general call for women study participation directing individuals to a study-specific webpage providing URL link access (this was done to comply with policies on health-related advertisement from the specific social media platforms used in this study). Participants then completed three screening questions based on inclusion criteria (ie, identified as woman, ages 35 and over, residing in Alberta), and those eligible reviewed the study information letter which described the objectives of examining cannabis use for menopause and provided informed consent electronically prior to the start of the survey. If a participant did not meet all three criteria for inclusion during screening, they were excluded. There was no maximum age for inclusion. Participation was voluntary and survey participants were offered the chance to enter a raffle draw for one of four $C50 gift cards.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Survey instrument design</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-18\">The 50-item survey instrument was investigator driven and informed by published literature,<a id=\"xref-ref-16-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-16\">16 17</a> as well as Canadian national cannabis surveys.<a id=\"xref-ref-18-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-18\">18 19</a> The survey was designed to take 15 min to complete, consisting of questions that were closed-ended and one open-ended question (survey instrument can be found in <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-1\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental material 1</a>). The survey was assessed for content validity by clinical experts (n=4) and pilot tested in a sample of women (n=10) using cognitive interviews.<a id=\"xref-ref-20-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-20\">20 21</a></p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"\">Supplemental material</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-20\">Data collected included demographics, medical history, self-reported changes to menstrual cycle and menopause symptoms, cannabis use and all respondents were asked about their perspectives related to cannabis, including use for menopause. Menopause stage was categorised through response to predefined descriptions of changes in menstrual cycle with or without presence of menopause symptoms, adapted from Marlatt <em>et al</em>.<a id=\"xref-ref-16-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-16\">16</a> Women were categorised as: ‘premenopause’ if periods were regular with no menopausal symptoms present; ‘perimenopause’ if periods were irregular or regular with presence of menopausal symptoms; ‘postmenopause’ if it had been more than 12 months since last menstrual period, regardless of menopause symptoms being present.<a id=\"xref-ref-16-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-16\">16</a> If menopause stage could not be determined, then women were categorised into ‘other’. Health literacy was captured through use of three screening questions validated by Chew <em>et al</em><a id=\"xref-ref-17-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-17\">17</a> and were coded and categorised into two groupings of ‘moderate to adequate’ or ‘inadequate’ health literacy. The term ‘cannabis’ was used as an all-encompassing term including any form of cannabis or marijuana and any components (including THC or CBD) derived from the cannabis plant. Cannabis use questions included: current (within past 30 days) and past cannabis use, frequency and duration of use, reasons for use (including menopause symptoms), cannabis form, type (CBD and/or THC) and product access. The survey used adaptive questioning and survey branching logic. Respondents not reporting current cannabis use were asked about past cannabis use, while never-users bypassed cannabis use questions and were directed to questions about perceptions and resources on cannabis use.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Sample size</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-21\">As this was an unrestricted, self-selected sample of participants, no specific sample size was calculated apriori for the survey. However, based on survey standards to set the CI at 95% and margin of error at 5%, and a proportional variable of interest with an infinite population we would need a minimum of n=385 participants in our sample.<a id=\"xref-ref-22-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-22\">22</a></p>\n",
       "<h3>Statistical analysis</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-22\">All survey respondents who met the study inclusion criteria and provided informed consent were included in the survey analysis. Summary statistics were used to describe the survey cohort. Descriptive analysis of categorical variables was reported as frequencies (percentages) representing participant demographics, medical and menopause characteristics, and cannabis use patterns and perceptions. Comparative analysis, using χ<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables as appropriate, were applied to assess between-group differences in (1) current cannabis versus non-users and (2) menopause stages for current cannabis use characteristics.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-23\">Logistic regression modelling on current cannabis users was completed to explore variables independently associated with cannabis use. Variables were included in univariable regression if they indicated statistical significance in group comparisons between current cannabis users vs current non-users (p&lt;0.05) or were identified by the research team as potential for clinical significance. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed using backward selection of independent variables included in univariable analysis, based on statistical significance (p&lt;0.05) in group comparisons or clinical significance. Multivariable regression analysis was, therefore, adjusted for age, menopause stage, education, health status and smoking status, while excluding menopause symptoms grouped post hoc due to complexity of grouped variables. These associations were reported as multivariable/adjusted OR (95% CI). All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS V.9.4 (SAS Institute) and p value for reporting of statistical significance was &lt;0.05.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Patient and public involvement</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-24\">Patient and public were not involved in design, conduct, reporting or dissemination of the research.</p>\n",
       "<h2 class=\"\">Results</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-25\">Of the 1761 women who completed the screening questions, 10 respondents did not meet the inclusion criteria and 266 did not provide informed consent. A total of 1485 respondents were included in the final analysis (<a id=\"xref-fig-1-1\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F1\">figure 1</a>). Characteristics of respondents are shown in <a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-1\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>. The median age was 49 years (range 35–72 years). Majority of respondents identified as white (92.9%), had postsecondary education or higher (88.0%),and had at least a moderate level of health literacy (95.4%). Overall, 35.2% of women were in postmenopause and 32.7% in perimenopause. Most frequently reported symptoms were difficulty with sleep (65.3%), concentration (49.2%) and anxiety (48.8%).</p>\n",

       "<h3>Characteristics of cannabis use</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-36\">Current cannabis use was reported by 499 respondents (33.6%) and an additional 479 (32.3%) reported past cannabis use only (<a id=\"xref-fig-1-2\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F1\">figure 1</a>). Current cannabis users reported lower education, history of cigarette smoking and poorer health compared with non-users (all p&lt;0.0001; <a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-2\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>). Current users reported experiencing more menopause symptoms compared with non-users, including difficulty with sleep, difficulty with concentration, anxiety, irritability, mood swings, depression, muscle/joint achiness (all p&lt;0.0001) and painful intercourse (p=0.014). Current users were also more likely to use natural health products or participate in cognitive behavioural therapy or meditation/mindfulness.</p>\n",

Of the current cannabis users (n=499), 33.9% reported using cannabis for medical use only and 41.1% both medical and recreational use. Only 22.6% used cannabis medically prescribed by a healthcare professional. Most women were using cannabis once daily or more (42.7%) and for a duration of more than 5 years (35.3%). Menopause symptoms for cannabis use including sleep difficulties (65.1%), anxiety (45.3%) and muscle/joint achiness (33.3%). Majority of respondents reported cannabis helpful with menopause symptoms (73.5%). Common forms of cannabis used were edibles (51.7%), oils (47.3%) and smoking (41.1%), with nearly two-thirds purchased cannabis products from in-person cannabis dispensaries (63.9%).</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-47\">Women in perimenopause and postmenopause were more likely to use cannabis for medical purposes (p&lt;0.0001) and have a medical prescription for cannabis (p=0.034), compared with premenopause (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-2-2\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T2\">table 2</a>). Women in postmenopause were more likely to use cannabis every day (p=0.0002) and report use for menopause symptoms, as compared with women in premenopause and perimenopause.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-48\">For women who only reported past cannabis use (n=479), majority used cannabis for recreational purposes only (69.9%). Reasons for stopping cannabis use were not wanting to use it anymore (35.5%), side effects (18.2%) or because it was illegal at the time (16.3%).</p>\n",
       "<h3>Perceptions on cannabis for medical purposes</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-49\">Over one-third of women surveyed (37.6%) indicated they would use cannabis now that it is legalised, with 38.7% expressing interest in using cannabis for menopause symptoms (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-3-1\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T3\">table 3</a>). Internet searches (46.3%), family or friends (34.1%) or cannabis dispensaries (22.8%) were the most common sources of information. Women indicated preference to receive cannabis information from physicians (50.2%), medical cannabis clinics (48.6%) and pharmacists (40.2%).</p>\n",

       "<h3>Factors associated with cannabis use</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-53\">In the multivariable model, smoking status and health status were the only significant variables independently associated with current cannabis use (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-4-1\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T4\">table 4</a>). Women who reported a history of cigarette smoking were 2.5 times more likely to report use compared with non-smokers (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.9 to 3.2, p&lt;0.0001). Women who self-reported neutral or poor health were more likely to use compared with those who reported good health (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.0 and OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.0, respectively, with p=0.0025).</p>\n",

       "<h2 class=\"\">Discussion</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-58\">One-third of women aged 35 and over in our survey reported current cannabis use and more than 65% used cannabis at some point in their life. Frequency of cannabis use ranged, however, most women who were current users used at least once daily. Our survey showed that two-thirds of women currently using cannabis used for medical purposes, yet most did not have cannabis medically prescribed. Current cannabis users indicated taking cannabis to manage menopause symptoms and found it helpful for their symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the largest study to directly investigate cannabis use and perceptions in a general population of women aged 35 and over.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-59\">Cannabis is largely viewed as an illicit drug internationally, but there is expanding legalisation along with changes to usage, prohibition, and research occurring globally.<a id=\"xref-ref-23-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-23\">23 24</a> However, cannabis is still more commonly used in North America and parts of Europe and Oceania.<a id=\"xref-ref-2-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-2\">2</a> As of 2020, it was estimated one in five Canadian women report recent use of cannabis, an increase since the 2018 Canadian legalisation of recreational cannabis.<a id=\"xref-ref-13-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-13\">13</a> Despite our survey showing a higher prevalence in cannabis use in relation to the general population, our results collectively provide a snapshot into use patterns in women aged 35 and over. Many Canadians are using cannabis medically without healthcare professional authorisation or guidance.<a id=\"xref-ref-25-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-25\">25 26</a> This is also reflected in the latest decline in medical cannabis clients registered with licensed producers authorised by Health Canada.<a id=\"xref-ref-27-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-27\">27 28</a> Legalisation may be the reason for these trends by easing access to cannabis products.<a id=\"xref-ref-29-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-29\">29</a> In our survey, women commonly accessed cannabis through in-person cannabis stores followed by online sales, both of which are legal means of product access in Alberta. Though many of these women used cannabis for medical reasons, most did not access healthcare providers as an information source. As well, women reported using a variety of cannabis products. Educating on cannabis product selection is an area healthcare providers can focus efforts on as it is already known that different routes of administration can yield different cannabis onset, effects and risk profiles.<a id=\"xref-ref-30-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-60\">Appropriate menopause care may be complicated by the fact women may not attribute symptoms to menopause simply due to a lack of awareness about menopause.<a id=\"xref-ref-31-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-31\">31 32</a> There is a well-recognised gap in menopause care,<a id=\"xref-ref-33-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-33\">33</a> which is further influenced by societal stigma around menopause and ageing, as well as lack of healthcare provider training in this area.<a id=\"xref-ref-32-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32</a> Women may be turning to cannabis because they are unaware of their options or may not be getting the care they need during menopause.<a id=\"xref-ref-32-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-61\">Our results show women are using cannabis for menopause related symptoms. Self-medicating with cannabis is already present in literature for a wide range of conditions and symptoms.<a id=\"xref-ref-34-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-34\">34</a> In general, many women in our survey reported cannabis was helpful for their symptoms. This was a global subjective assessment of cannabis effect on their menopause symptoms, and we caution on the validity of this finding as our survey was not set up to assess the effect of cannabis on individual symptoms. Current cannabis guidelines from the Society of Obstetrician and Gynaecologists of Canada do not support the use of cannabis for menopause due to the lack of available evidence.<a id=\"xref-ref-35-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-35\">35</a> Yet, women are using cannabis for this indication as demonstrated in a survey of midlife women veterans in the USA, which reported over a quarter of women had used cannabis for menopause symptom management (published as abstract only).<a id=\"xref-ref-36-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-36\">36</a> Furthermore, Dahlgren <em>et al</em> recently published a study from the USA assessing patterns of medical cannabis use in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.<a id=\"xref-ref-37-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-37\">37</a> Their survey administration overlapped with the time frame as our mixed methods study. They found that 86.1% of women in their sample of 258 survey respondents were using cannabis for menopausal symptoms and that 78.7% endorsed it for menopause symptoms.<a id=\"xref-ref-37-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-37\">37</a> Similar to our findings the most commonly reported symptoms for cannabis use were sleep difficulties and mood/anxiety.<a id=\"xref-ref-37-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-37\">37</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-62\">Still few studies have looked at the effect of cannabis on improving menopausal symptoms, as identified in a recently published systematic review.<a id=\"xref-ref-10-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-10\">10</a> Despite MHT being effective in women for VMS, some women continue to desire alternative methods of managing menopause beyond prescribed therapies.<a id=\"xref-ref-6-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-6\">6 38</a> Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and compounded bioidentical hormone therapy (cBHT) is prevalent despite mixed evidence and lack of recommendations by clinical guidelines.<a id=\"xref-ref-4-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-4\">4 5 39</a> Cannabis appears to follow the same trend as CAM and cBHT use by women for menopausal symptoms, warranting further exploration of how women perceive cannabis as a medicine. One study investigated the impact of smoked cannabis on mood in postmenopausal women.<a id=\"xref-ref-40-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-40\">40</a> Another examined associations of drug use and menopause in women with HIV, and found hot flashes to be associated with cannabis use.<a id=\"xref-ref-41-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-41\">41</a> An American survey of menopausal women endorsing lifetime cannabis use reported expectations for cannabis to relieve menopause symptoms, including musculoskeletal discomfort, sleep issues, mood changes and hot flashes.<a id=\"xref-ref-42-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-42\">42</a> Our survey did not measure expectancies for symptom relief; however, women were asked to indicate cannabis use for specific symptoms. Women who reported current cannabis use were more likely to report experiencing menopause symptoms compared with non-users, specifically sleep difficulties, mood symptoms, muscle/joint achiness and urogenital symptoms. Our data add to the evidence indicating midlife women’s use of cannabis medically, as well as emphasise the high level of interest on cannabis through the large number of responses in our survey.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-63\">Women in our survey used the internet as a main source of information on cannabis, suggesting cannabis use is driven by sharing of anecdotal information. The internet is a source for easily shared information, resulting in misleading health claims including menopause.<a id=\"xref-ref-43-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-43\">43</a> Women may be reluctant to discuss cannabis with healthcare providers and resort to self-medicating because of fear of stigmatisation.<a id=\"xref-ref-44-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-44\">44</a> Health professionals are hesitant to provide guidance on use of cannabis therapeutically due to lack of evidence, lack of product standardisation and dosing, and unfamiliarity.<a id=\"xref-ref-45-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-45\">45 46</a> Yet, our data show that women prefer to receive cannabis information from their healthcare providers, highlighting the importance of developing women’s cannabis-specific evidence-based resources for patients and providers.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Limitations</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-64\">This study has several limitations to be considered when interpreting findings. First, our recruitment strategy included women who had access to the internet and were able to complete the survey in English, which may limit the generalisability to all women aged 35 or over. It is difficult to estimate our population for the survey given that this was an unrestricted and self-selected survey with women who had access to social media platforms. This was an exploratory study designed to inform further research, including the next qualitative phase of this mixed-methods study. These findings are not representative of the full population of women aged 35 and over, other than the women who completed the survey. Online data collection may impact complete representativeness of the population, however, the large number of responses collected in the short time frame suggests our survey method was effective to engage women in study participation. As well, our sample of self-selected women addressed the lack of evidence available on cannabis for self-management of symptoms in this population to justify future clinical investigations. Second, our survey cohort was highly educated and there was an underrepresentation of ethnic or racial minorities. To compare, 88% of women in our survey had some level of postsecondary education vs 65% of women in Alberta per census data.<a id=\"xref-ref-47-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-47\">47</a> Third, this study relied on self-reported data to categorise menopause stages and symptoms. All women were asked to report presence of menopause symptoms, which may have inadvertently introduced confounders and self-reporting bias. Other limitations, common to survey design include information bias, prevarication bias, notoriety bias, and social desirability which may have influenced how women may have responded to questions around cannabis or menopause. Fourth, it was beyond the scope of the study to objectively measure the positive or negative effects of cannabis use on individual symptom control, nor can this data establish causality. While we asked past users if side effects were the reason for stopping cannabis use, we did not explore perceived cannabis related adverse effects in current users. Fifth, the term cannabis in our study was defined according to Canadian regulations.<a id=\"xref-ref-11-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-11\">11</a> We recognise that cannabis definitions may differ depending on country-specific regulations. Finally, as medical cannabis is not currently covered by most Canadian healthcare plans, the population who use cannabis will be women who can afford it. Affordability of cannabis, including out of pocket expenses, to establish associations with demographic characteristics was beyond the scope of this survey. Rather, we developed a cross-sectional survey to identify cannabis usage patterns and provide insight on associations for further hypothesis generating and clinical investigations.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-65\">Some women are using cannabis for symptoms related to menopause. Our survey established that women are using cannabis for symptoms during the menopause transition. Information about cannabis was more frequently accessed through online searches and personal contacts, with limited involvement of healthcare providers. Further research is required to investigate the efficacy and safety of cannabis on menopause symptoms and foster the development of clinical resources for women to use in making informed decisions around cannabis for medical purposes.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n",
       "<p>Neonatal mortality is a major concern for public health [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>], especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where optimized use of antimicrobial agents is problematic for many neonates [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. The Every Newborn Action Plan aims for countries to have ≤12 neonatal deaths per 1,000 livebirths by 2030 or ≤10 by 2035 [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>]. However, neonatal mortality rates vary significantly across countries, with a substantial proportion of deaths occurring in LMICs. In 2020, an estimated 2.4 million neonates died worldwide at an average global rate of 17 deaths per 1,000 live births (<a href=\"https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-survival/neonatal-mortality/\">https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-survival/neonatal-mortality/</a>). More than half of neonatal deaths are associated with infections [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. In particular, neonates in LMICs have infection rates 3 to 20 times higher than those in high-income countries [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> is a leading pathogen for neonatal infections [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>] and is actually a complex comprising 5 closely related species including <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> (<em>sensu stricto</em>), <em>Klebsiella quasipneumoniae</em>, <em>Klebsiella variicola</em>, <em>Klebsiella quasivariicola</em>, and <em>Klebsiella africana</em> [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. Phenotype-based identification kits or systems such as API 20E, Vitek II, and BD Phoenix are widely used in clinical microbiology laboratories but provide limited performance for differentiating <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> complex at the species level [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is also widely used for species identification, but misidentification of <em>Klebsiella</em> species occurs [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. Even 16S ribosomal RNA (a constituent of the small subunit of prokaryotic ribosomes) gene sequencing, a common method of the molecular genetic approaches for species identification, does not reliably identify species within the <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> complex [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>]. Precise species identification relies on whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. As such, <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> reported in many studies may actually represent the complex rather than <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> (<em>sensu stricto</em>).</p>\n",
       "<p>In LMICs, the incidence of neonatal <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> infection varies between 4.1 and 6.3 per 1,000 livebirths with a case fatality rate of 18% to 68% [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>]. <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> is also responsible for 16% to 28% of neonatal blood culture–confirmed sepsis in different countries [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>]. A systematic review has estimated that the pooled proportion of neonatal sepsis caused by gram-negative organisms was 60% and that <em>Klebsiella</em> species accounted for 38% of sepsis caused by gram-negatives [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. Another systematic review has identified that among 84,534 neonates from 26 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, <em>Klebsiella</em> spp. accounted for 15% to 21% of culture-positive sepsis [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. Although the 2 systematic reviews did not specify the species [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>], it appears that most <em>Klebsiella</em> strains causing sepsis were <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> by examining the included studies.</p>\n",
       "<p>Among bacterial pathogens in neonates, <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> is notorious for the high prevalence of resistance towards most antimicrobial agents [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>]. In particular, carbapenem-resistant <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> (CRKP) is associated with increased mortality of patients [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>], represents a serious public health threat, and has become the dominant pathogen disseminated in healthcare settings [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. However, surveillance in many LMICs is often problematic in completeness and fidelity largely due to insufficient local data, inconsistent laboratory quality, and scarce microbiological facilities [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]. To date, the global burden of neonatal infections caused by CRKP has not yet been assessed.</p>\n",
       "<p>Accordingly, we performed a systematic review of studies reporting population-based neonatal infections caused by CRKP to evaluate the availability of data worldwide and then attempted to provide an estimated prevalence of CRKP in neonatal infection globally. In addition, we utilized publicly available CRKP genomes with neonatal origins to complement the literature for information about species, strain types, and carbapenemases.</p>\n",
       "<h2>Methods</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Search strategy and selection criteria</h3>\n",
       "<p>This study was designed and is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA; <a href=\"#pmed.1004233.s001\">S1 Text</a>) and registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42022346445). The full protocol for this study is available in the supporting information (<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.s002\">S2 Text</a>). We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane, bioRxiv, and medRxiv to identify studies up to June 30, 2022, that reported neonatal infections caused by CRKP. The search strings were “<em>Klebsiella</em>” and “neonate,” “<em>Klebsiella</em>” and “neonatal,” “<em>Klebsiella</em>” and “newborn,” “<em>Klebsiella</em>” and “NICU,” “CRKP” and “neonate,” “CRKP” and “neonatal,” “CRKP” and “newborn,” and “CRKP” and “NICU.” We also examined articles in the reference lists of retrieved articles. We included all studies in English or non-English languages. For studies in a language other than English and Chinese, we used Google translate for translation.</p>\n",
       "<p>We assessed studies addressing the prevalence of CRKP infections and colonization in neonates. We examined all study populations regardless of age, presence of symptoms, or study location. We considered surveillance, cohort, nested cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional, and randomized studies for estimating the prevalence. We also investigated case reports and microbiological and genomic studies for species, strain types, and carbapenemases of CRKP strains in neonates.</p>\n",
       "<p>We excluded studies where the numbers of neonates in the study or the geographical location are not available, from estimating the prevalence. We also excluded studies lacking independent data on <em>Klebsiella</em> or CRKP isolates. For data that were from the same study population but were reported in multiple articles, we extracted those from the most comprehensive report. LMICs were defined using the list of World Bank (<a href=\"https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups\">https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups</a>).</p>\n",
       "<h3>Data extraction</h3>\n",
       "<p>Two groups (4 investigators, 2 per group) independently reviewed the identified studies to determine eligibility. Disagreement over inclusion was resolved by arbitration by an additional, fifth, investigator.</p>\n",
       "<p>Using a standardized data abstraction sheet, the following variables were recorded from articles that met our inclusion criteria: study design, country, study setting, study participants, year, population, age, sex, CRKP numbers and/or proportions, source of infection, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, genomes and data availability, sequence types (STs), antimicrobial resistance genes, and primary outcomes.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Quality assessment</h3>\n",
       "<p>The quality of each included article (<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.s013\">S1 Dataset</a>) was assessed independently by 2 investigators using either the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) quality assessment tool for case-control, cross-sectional, and cohort studies or Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized controlled trials. A consensus was reached by a panel discussion among 5 investigators. The results of quality assessment are summarized in <a href=\"#pmed.1004233.s014\">S2 Dataset</a> for cross-sectional studies, <a href=\"#pmed.1004233.s015\">S3 Dataset</a> for cohort studies, and <a href=\"#pmed.1004233.s016\">S4 Dataset</a> for case-control studies.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Statistical analysis</h3>\n",
       "<p>We extracted raw data from the included studies and recalculated estimates wherever possible based on the extracted data. Descriptive analyses were used to describe the population. Pooled prevalence, mortality, and colonization rate were calculated and were presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Rates and proportions were compared across groups using the chi-squared test. Analyses were performed using JMP Pro 14 statistical software (JMP; Cary, NC, USA) and Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.4.1 (The Cochrane Collaboration, 2020). Considering the limited number of eligible studies and the heterogeneity of the studies, we employed narrative synthesis to estimate the pooled prevalence, mortality, and colonization rate without measuring the biases with RevMan using the “Generic Inverse Variance” type and “Random” mode. Continuous variables were presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). Categorical variables were presented as numbers and percentages. All <em>p</em>-values of &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Construction of dataset used for <em>de novo</em> genomic analysis</h3>\n",
       "<p>First, all BioProjects (<em>n</em> = 2,761) mentioning neonates or neonatal ICUs in their titles or descriptions were retrieved from NCBI by searching strategy “neonatal[All Fields] OR neonate[All Fields] OR neonates[All Fields] OR newborn[All Fields] OR newborns[All Fields] OR nicu[All Fields]” up to June 30, 2022. By applying filter “Bacteria” and manual curation for <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> complex in neonates, 37 BioProjects with short reads in Sequence Read Archive (SRA) or assembly remained. Second, all BioSamples (<em>n</em> = 86,635) under the genus <em>Klebsiella</em> were retrieved, and those with the presence of keywords neonatal, neonate, newborn, or NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) were included for further curation. Third, genomes with accession numbers mentioned in all included publications (<em>n</em> = 21) regarding neonate-associated <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> complex were also included in the dataset. Of note, local assemblies from SRA data were preferred over NCBI-retrieved ones. BioSample duplications, SRA with sequencing depth lower than 30 × and reads obtained from Nanopore sequencing only were discarded.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Genomic profiling and analysis</h3>\n",
       "<p>All included genomes (<em>n</em> = 2,093), each with a unique BioSample number, were subjected to a series of quality control and genome profiling measures. All bioinformatic settings and thresholds were set to the default unless otherwise specified. Among the 2,093 genomes, 264 were assembled and 1,829 had only short reads without assembly available. Therefore, short reads of the 1,829 genomes were retrieved from SRA of NCBI and were trimmed to remove adapters and reads shorter than 30 bp using Trimmomatic v.0.39 [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. For each of the 1,829 genomes, maximum coverage of 150 × sequencing depth was subsampled using SeqKit v2.2.0 [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>] and assembled into a draft genome using SPAdes v3.15.3 [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>] under the isolate mode.</p>\n",
       "<p>The precise species identification for each genome was performed using FastANI v1.33 [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>] by comparing genomes with type strain of each species from the genus <em>Klebsiella</em>. The completeness and heterogeneity of genomes were assessed using CheckM v1.1.10 [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>]. STs and virulence factors were identified using Kleborate v2.2.0 [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>]. Antimicrobial resistance genes were detected using AMRFinderPlus v3.10.23 [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>]. Plasmid replicons were typed using PlasmidFinder v2.1 [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>].</p>\n",
       "<h2>Results</h2>\n",
       "<h3>There were 128 articles reporting neonatal CRKP infection or colonization in 30 countries of 4 continents</h3>\n",

Furthermore, we demonstrated that most neonatal CRKP strains have genes encoding MBLs, in particular NDM.</p>\n",
       "<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive systematic review to assess neonatal infections caused by CRKP globally to date. About 135 million babies are born annually in the world [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref162\" class=\"ref-tip\">162</a>], among which over 15 million new births are early or premature (<a href=\"https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/neonatal-infant-care-market\">https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/neonatal-infant-care-market</a>) and therefore are likely to be admitted to hospitals.

This is likely to be due to the fact that only limited data were available but could also suggest that CRKP seen in neonates have emerged multiple times in many different places, many countries may have their own specific lineages of CRKP in neonates, and most CRKP lineages in neonates are not globally disseminated. Nonetheless, we identified several particularly widespread lineages. ST17 CRKP is of a particular concern as it was identified in neonates in 8 countries of 4 continents and has also caused outbreaks of neonatal infections [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref081\" class=\"ref-tip\">81</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref082\" class=\"ref-tip\">82</a>].

Non-carbapenem-resistant ST17 <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> has been found to commonly carry genes encoding ESBLs [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref168\" class=\"ref-tip\">168</a>–<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref173\" class=\"ref-tip\">173</a>]. The vast majority of neonatal ST17 CRKP strains also carry ESBL genes [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref128\" class=\"ref-tip\">128</a>], and there were 48 neonatal ST17 CRKP strains with genome sequences available, among which ESBL gene <em>bla</em><sub>CTX-M</sub> was found in 43 (89.6%; <a href=\"#pmed.1004233.s019\">S7 Dataset</a>). This suggests that the ST17 CRKP may emerge as a result of acquisition of carbapenemase genes by ESBL-producing progenitors. Among other commonly identified STs for neonatal CRKP, ST11, ST15, and ST307 have also been frequently seen in adult patients. ST11 is particularly prevalent in Asia and South America and is typically associated with KPC-2 [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref174\" class=\"ref-tip\">174</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref175\" class=\"ref-tip\">175</a>]. In contrast, neonatal CRKP of ST11 appears to have NDM more commonly than KPC (<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.s018\">S6 Dataset</a>). ST15 is an international high-risk lineage associated with a variety of carbapenemases including KPC, NDM, IMP, and OXA-48-like [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref176\" class=\"ref-tip\">176</a>–<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref178\" class=\"ref-tip\">178</a>]. In neonates, ST15 appears to be particularly common in South and Southeast Asia such as Nepal (with NDM-1) [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref117\" class=\"ref-tip\">117</a>], Pakistan (with both NDM-1 and OXA-181) [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>], and Vietnam (with KPC-2; [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref128\" class=\"ref-tip\">128</a>]) but has different carbapenemases. ST307 is another international high-risk lineage, endemic in Colombia, southern Europe (Italy, Portugal, and Spain), South Africa, and Texas of United States of America [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref179\" class=\"ref-tip\">179</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref180\" class=\"ref-tip\">180</a>], and is associated with various carbapenemases. However, neonatal CRKP of ST307 was mainly reported from Asia (China, Bangladesh, and Vietnam) [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref072\" class=\"ref-tip\">72</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref181\" class=\"ref-tip\">181</a>] (<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.s017\">S5 Table</a> and <a href=\"#pmed.1004233.s018\">S6</a> Dataset). On the other hand, ST258 and its derivate ST512 are widely acknowledged as the major international high-risk type of CRKP in adults [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref174\" class=\"ref-tip\">174</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref182\" class=\"ref-tip\">182</a>] but were only sporadically found in neonates (<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.s008\">S5 Table</a>). The above findings suggest that major CRKP lineages in neonates may be different from those in adults, which warrants further studies. In addition, the common associations of carbapenemases with particular plasmid replicon types in strains of different clonal background suggest possible major vehicles mediating the horizontal transmission of certain carbapenemase-encoding genes, resulting in CRKP affecting neonates. Well-designed epidemiological and genomic studies are required to untangle such plasmid-mediated transmissions of carbapenem resistance to/from and among pathogens for neonatal infections.</p>\n",
       "<p>As we focused on the prevalence, we did not examine risk factors of neonatal CRKP infection in this study, but such risk factors have been identified in previous studies [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref099\" class=\"ref-tip\">99</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref146\" class=\"ref-tip\">146</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref183\" class=\"ref-tip\">183</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref184\" class=\"ref-tip\">184</a>]. Some of these risk factors are identical to those for CRKP infection in nonneonatal patients including mechanical ventilation, prolonged length of stay, and prior exposure to antimicrobial agents (in particular carbapenems), while some others are specific for neonates including premature birth, low birth weight, and the use of umbilical vein catheters [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref099\" class=\"ref-tip\">99</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref146\" class=\"ref-tip\">146</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref183\" class=\"ref-tip\">183</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref184\" class=\"ref-tip\">184</a>]. In this study, we focused on carbapenem resistance, while ESBLs also represent a challenge for clinical management [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref185\" class=\"ref-tip\">185</a>]. Although large-scale multisite studies addressing the prevalence of ESBL-producing <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> in neonates are still lacking, several single-site studies have demonstrated a 15% to 90.6% [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref186\" class=\"ref-tip\">186</a>–<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref190\" class=\"ref-tip\">190</a>] prevalence of ESBL genes in neonatal <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> strains. We also found 77.01% of the 535 neonatal CRKP genomes containing genes encoding CTX-M, the major type of ESBLs (<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.s018\">S6 Dataset</a>). This suggests a high prevalence, which is not within the scope of the present study but warrants further investigation.</p>\n",
       "<p>The strength of this study is the comprehensive review of all available studies comprising 127,583 neonates across 30 countries and the hybrid approach of incorporating publicly available genomes of <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> complex of neonatal origins and carrying carbapenemase genes into analysis. Such a hybrid approach allows maximizing the utilization of all data and then generating more extensive and in-depth views of neonatal CRKP infections. We are aware of limitations of this study. First, although we attempted to estimate the prevalence of CRKP infections in all neonates, we were unable to identify relevant studies comprising nonhospitalized ones. As a result, we could only estimate the prevalence of CRKP infections in hospitalized neonates. Second, only a limited number of studies were eligible for analysis. Due to the limited available and obtainable data, we were unable to perform a meta-analysis in addition to a systematic review for the prevalence of neonatal CRKP infections. Third, the geographic coverage of eligible studies is incomplete and biased. Most included studies were from LMICs in Africa and Asia, while no data from North America and Oceania and very few from South America were eligible for analysis. This is largely due to the fact that although CRKP have been well reported in North America and Oceania, these articles reporting CRKP there did not specify whether neonates were involved (e.g., [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref191\" class=\"ref-tip\">191</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref192\" class=\"ref-tip\">192</a>]), data specific for neonates could not be separated from other populations (e.g., [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref193\" class=\"ref-tip\">193</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref194\" class=\"ref-tip\">194</a>]), or data on CRKP could not be separated from those on carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) (e.g., [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref195\" class=\"ref-tip\">195</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref196\" class=\"ref-tip\">196</a>]). To mitigate this problem, we also utilized all publicly available CRKP genomes of neonatal origins for providing complementary information for strain typing and carbapenemases. Notably, 38% genomes included for analysis were not linked to studies pooled for estimating the prevalence, publicly available genomes themselves could be largely biased, and we only included CRKP genomes with carbapenemases. Therefore, the genomes were unable to provide information about the prevalence of neonatal CRKP infections but are still precious sources for providing crucial information for clonal background and carbapenemase types complementing that from literature. Fourth, the included studies were remarkably heterogeneous in quality, design, study populations (NICU and non-NICU), and methods for defining carbapenem resistance, identifying species and typing strains. The heterogeneity generates a wide range of estimated prevalence of neonatal CRKP infections, which was subjected to variations when new data become available. These limitations are primarily driven by data gaps and data sparsity. Well-designed studies of neonatal CRKP infections using standardized protocols are needed to be performed in and reported from more countries, in particular those in Americas, Europe, and Oceania, and such data could be incorporated for future iterations to increase the robustness of estimating the global prevalence. Networks comprising multiple countries such as the BARNARDS network for LMICs [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>] could be a viable choice. Despite these limitations, we believe that this study is a unique contribution for understanding CRKP in hospitalized neonates and provides much-needed insights for addressing disease burden, informing infection control, and guiding clinical management.</p>\n",
       "<p>We believe that our findings have important implications for research, surveillance, treatment, and infection control. First, our study highlights that neonatal CRKP infection is a significant burden for public health worldwide. The problem of neonatal CRKP infection may be exaggerated along with the increased consumption of antimicrobial agents. The global antimicrobial consumption in children has increased by 46% between 2000 and 2018 [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref197\" class=\"ref-tip\">197</a>], which could be largely attributed to the increase in LMICs [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref198\" class=\"ref-tip\">198</a>]. Alarmingly, as pathogens resistant to WHO-recommended ampicillin and gentamicin have been increasingly identified, carbapenems have become the first-line choice for treating neonatal cases of sepsis in some LMICs [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. Consequently, the emergence of CRKP in neonatal infections is of increasing concern. Therefore, CRKP in neonates warrant further studies and more, large-scale, rigorous surveillance at national or regional levels. Second, unlike the well-known high-risk CRKP lineages ST258 [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref199\" class=\"ref-tip\">199</a>], ST11 [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref200\" class=\"ref-tip\">200</a>], and ST307 [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref179\" class=\"ref-tip\">179</a>], ST17 receives much less attentions. The association of ST17 CRKP with neonates is of particular interest, and more studies are required to elucidate the emergence and dissemination of this lineage in neonates. Third, the finding that most neonatal CRKP strains have genes encoding MBLs could inform treatment. It is worth of pointing out that the distribution of carbapenemases varies across regions, and even hospitals and the prediction of the predominant carbapenemases should be based on the local epidemiology. However, the dominance of MBLs in neonatal CRKP in many parts of the world is alarmingly. Combinations of a β-lactam and a newer β-lactamase inhibitor including ceftazidime-avibactam [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref201\" class=\"ref-tip\">201</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref202\" class=\"ref-tip\">202</a>], meropenem-vaborbactam [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref201\" class=\"ref-tip\">201</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref202\" class=\"ref-tip\">202</a>], and imipenem-relebactam [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref201\" class=\"ref-tip\">201</a>] are recommended as the major choice to treat infections caused by CRE including CRKP [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref201\" class=\"ref-tip\">201</a>]. The newer β-lactamase inhibitors avibactam, vaborbactam, and relebactam have good activities against most serine-based β-lactamases such as carbapenemase KPC but are unable to inhibit MBLs such as IMP, NDM, and VIM [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref203\" class=\"ref-tip\">203</a>]. For MBL-producing CRE, ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, and imipenem-relebactam are therefore not effective. The combination of ceftazidime-avibactam and aztreonam, which is stable to the hydrolysis by MBLs [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref204\" class=\"ref-tip\">204</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref205\" class=\"ref-tip\">205</a>], is recommended against MBL-producing CRE [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref201\" class=\"ref-tip\">201</a>]. Cefiderocol is another choice against MBL-producing CRKP but is not available in many countries [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref201\" class=\"ref-tip\">201</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref202\" class=\"ref-tip\">202</a>]. Polymyxin B or E (colistin) could be an alternative but is commonly associated with poorer outcomes comparing with β-lactams [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref201\" class=\"ref-tip\">201</a>]. Nonetheless, the common presence of MBLs in neonatal CRKP strains accentuates the call for developing MBL inhibitors, which have not been approved for clinical use, but significant advances have been made in this realm [<a href=\"#pmed.1004233.ref206\" class=\"ref-tip\">206</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>In conclusion, we estimated that the pooled prevalence of neonatal CRKP infection was 0.3% (95% CI, 0.2% to 0.3%) with a 22.9% (95% CI, 13.0% to 32.9%) pooled mortality of infected neonates based on literature. We observed very diverse clonal backgrounds of neonatal CRKP strains, which indicates multiple origins. We identified that ST17, ST11, and ST15 were widespread CRKP lineages in neonates, and such lineages warrant rigorous monitoring. We found that most neonatal CRKP strains have genes encoding MBLs, in particular NDM, rendering approved antimicrobial agents containing newer β-lactamase inhibitors such as ceftazidime-avibactam, the mainstream choices against CRKP, ineffective. The above findings highlight that CRKP is a significant threat to neonates, in particular to those in LMICs, and characterize neonatal CRKP infections to inform infection control and treatment. To combat neonatal CRKP infections, rigorous surveillance will lay a foundation by revealing the local epidemiology of the strains and the carbapenemases and needs to be established or enhanced with considering measures like environmental sampling and active screening for those in high risks. For managing neonatal CRKP infections, antimicrobial agents with coverage for MBLs may be the initial choice and then could be tailored when the susceptibility testing results become available.</p>\n",

       "<p>Reducing treatment duration is a common strategy used to reduce antibiotic consumption and a core feature of antibiotic stewardship programmes (ASPs) [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. This includes optimising definitive antibiotic courses for established bacterial infections while ensuring clinical cure, and rapid discontinuation of empiric prescriptions after bacterial infections are ruled out. Compared with restricting prescriptions, this “back-end” approach of minimising treatment duration is deemed safer for patients and more likely to be accepted by physicians [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>]. Numerous randomised trials have concluded that short treatment approaches for common bacterial infections are noninferior to long treatment courses in terms of clinical outcomes [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>–<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>The primary motivation behind shortening treatment duration is the expectation that it will reduce antibiotic selective pressure for antimicrobial resistance in treated individuals and, over time, will lead to lower prevalence of resistance at a population level [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. However, while antibiotic selective pressure as a driver of resistance is not in doubt, there are many gaps in our understanding of the relationship between duration and the prevalence of resistance [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>–<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. Specifically, clinical trials of reduced antibiotic treatment duration have reported conflicting effects on resistance carriage at both individual and population levels (<a href=\"#pmed-1004013-t001\">Table 1</a>).</p>\n",

       "<p>Antibiotics promote resistance by killing or inhibiting the growth of susceptible microbes while allowing resistant ones to grow. This selective pressure for resistance most clearly applies to pathogens directly targeted by the antibiotic when used to treat or prevent infections. Examples of pathogens that may become resistant during treatment include <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, fluoroquinolone-resistant Enterobacterales, and human immunodeficiency virus, especially with inappropriate dosing and duration [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>]. More recently, it has been recognised that, for most bacterial pathogens, antibiotic selection pressure largely results from “bystander” selection, which occurs when colonising bacteria are exposed to antibiotics that are not intentionally targeting them [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. The impact of bystander exposures to antibiotics depends on their spectrum of coverage, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, and bioavailability where the bacteria are located. Antibiotic resistance in colonising bacteria is clinically important because asymptomatic carriage of these bacteria typically precedes invasive infection, and preventing colonisation will reduce associated morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>–<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. For these reasons, this study focuses on the “bystander” selective pressure resulting from different durations of antibiotic treatment on colonising bacteria.</p>\n",
       "<p>Emergence of resistance in colonising bacteria may be due to selection of resistant phenotypes that are present at the start of treatment but at low abundance or acquired by transmission during treatment, as a result of horizontal gene transfer, or as a result of de novo mutations. The effect of treatment duration on development of resistance will depend on the parameters governing these processes and their relative importance.</p>\n",
       "<p>To gain a mechanistic understanding of this relation between antibiotic treatment duration and the prevalence of colonisation with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospitalised patients, we modelled within- and between-host dynamics of susceptible and resistant bacteria in response to systemic antibiotic treatment. We then sought to compare the model findings with empirical observations by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis.</p>\n",
       "<h2>Methods and materials</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Modelling dynamics of colonising bacteria in response to antibiotic treatment</h3>\n",
       "<p>Three stochastic agent-based models with increasing complexity and biological realism were constructed. From here on, they will be referred to as simple exclusive colonisation model, co-colonisation model, and within-host growth model (<a href=\"#pmed-1004013-g001\">Fig 1</a>).</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p>\n",
       "<p>These flow diagrams describe within-host changes in resistant and sensitive bacteria carried by each individual patient in response to antibiotic consumption, bacterial growth, and transmission events. In the 3 models, all patients were assumed to be always colonised with bacteria. In the exclusive colonisation model, patients can be colonised with resistant bacteria (R), and high or low levels of sensitive bacteria (<em>S</em> or <em>s</em>), but not both resistant and sensitive at the same time due to complete bacterial interference. The co-colonisation model makes a more realistic assumption that patients may be colonised with both resistant and sensitive bacteria at the same time with different levels of abundance. Similarly, in the within-host growth model, patients carry both resistant and sensitive bacteria but their combined populations cannot exceed a maximum carrying capacity. Blue, orange, and pink squares/circles represent the host states when the host is carrying susceptible, a mix of susceptible and resistant, and resistant bacteria, respectively. The red arrows highlight antibiotic killing of resistant bacteria. All transmission and decolonisation events apply to resistant bacteria.</p>\n",

       "<p>In all models, we simulated individual patients (agents) in a single hospital ward environment. The patients’ colonisation status could change due to (i) differential growth/killing rates of resistant and sensitive bacterial populations within a patient; (ii) transmission events between patients; and (iii) loss of resistance carriage (<a href=\"#pmed-1004013-g001\">Fig 1</a>). Because the population size under consideration is small and local fade-out events (when resistant populations reach zero) are potentially important, we considered stochastic implementations of these models (<a href=\"#pmed-1004013-g002\">Fig 2</a> and Section S1.1 in <a href=\"#pmed.1004013.s001\">S1 Text</a>), i.e., changes in colonisation status took place with a probability randomly drawn from a distribution.</p>\n",

       "<p>Within the same ward, antibiotics (administered via both intravenous and oral routes) were prescribed with the same mean duration on or during admission. Exact duration for each antibiotic course was drawn from a uniform distribution (range for short duration 3 to 7 days, range for long duration 14 to 21 days). We considered 2 scenarios. In the first, the resistant phenotype was assumed to be susceptible to one of the administered antibiotics, e.g., carbapenems against third-generation cephalosporin resistance. In the second scenario, there was no effective antibiotic available against the resistant phenotype in the colonising bacteria, e.g., colistin or carbapenem resistance. Subsequently, we refer to these 2 scenarios as “administered antibiotics have activity against resistant and susceptible organisms” and “administered antibiotics have activity only against susceptible organisms.”</p>\n",
       "<p>The models assumed that antibiotics act within-host by selectively promoting the growth of existing resistant bacteria in the gut [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>], and between-host by predisposing the treated individual to become more likely to transmit resistant bacteria as a consequence of a higher bacterial load (<a href=\"#pmed-1004013-g001\">Fig 1</a>) [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. Spontaneous decolonisation of resistant bacteria was assumed to only occur when a patient was not receiving antibiotics to which the colonising bacteria were resistant.</p>\n",
       "<p>In the exclusive colonisation model, patients could be carriers of either susceptible or resistant bacteria but not of both at the same time [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]. In this model, for a carrier of susceptible bacteria to become a resistance carrier required transmission of resistant bacteria from another carrier in the ward, i.e., we did not consider de novo resistance emergence or horizontal transfer from other components of the flora. In the other 2 more complex models, patients could carry both susceptible and resistant bacteria simultaneously. In the co-colonisation model, these abundances were dichotomised into high and low, and only bacteria carried at a high level were able to be transmitted to other patients [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. In the within-host growth model, bacterial population sizes could vary continuously but had to be above a threshold in order to be capable of transmission to others [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>]. We also assumed a total carrying capacity for gram-negative bacteria [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>] and note that newly admitted patients may carry fewer bacteria than the carrying capacity as we would expect some patients were prescribed antibiotics prior to admission. The mean total carrying capacity for each iteration was drawn from a lognormal distribution (Table A in <a href=\"#pmed.1004013.s001\">S1 Text</a>). In the latter 2 models, an individual could become a resistance carrier from within-host selection of preexisting resistant bacteria through antibiotic consumption.</p>\n",
       "<p>While the modelling framework we have adopted is quite general, here we focus on parameter space that are appropriate for gram-negative bacteria as they are the commonest cause of urinary tract and bloodstream infections and frequently associated with multidrug-resistant hospital-acquired infections. The predominant mechanisms for resistance dissemination in gram-negative bacteria colonising the gut are horizontal transfer of mobile genetic elements and clonal expansion [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>We first explored the models by varying pairs of parameters over a grid of values while holding the other parameter values constant. This was followed by global sensitivity analysis using Latin Hypercube sampling and Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (S1.3 Section in <a href=\"#pmed.1004013.s001\">S1 Text</a>). Real-world parameter values were obtained from the literature and used in these explorations (Table A in <a href=\"#pmed.1004013.s001\">S1 Text</a>). For those parameter values not found in the literature, we explored the largest reasonable range of parameter values. In all results shown below, each simulation was produced from at least 50,000 iterations (100 repeats of 500 unique sets of parameters selected within the ranges shown in Table A in <a href=\"#pmed.1004013.s001\">S1 Text</a>) over 300 days.

       "<p>The models were used to assess how changing duration of antibiotic treatment affected the risk of resistance colonisation at both individual and population levels. Three types of outcomes were considered: resistance carriage among (i) treated patients and, therefore, directly affected by different treatment durations; (ii) overall resistance carriage within a ward population that consisted of treated and untreated patients, i.e., indirectly affected by treatment duration received by those treated patients; and (iii) patients who were not carriers of resistant bacteria when admitted to the ward. To evaluate reducing antibiotic duration as an intervention, all the model outputs were assessed as absolute difference between the short and long wards.</p>\n",

Search strings are provided in Table A in <a href=\"#pmed.1004013.s002\">S2 Text</a>. Studies that compared antibiotics to no antibiotic treatment were excluded. Quality assessment of the studies was performed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2 tool) [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>].

       "<p>The study methodologies and outcomes were expected to be too diverse to be meaningfully included in a single meta-analysis. Instead, we prespecified a relatively homogeneous group defined by studies that (i) measured asymptomatic carriage of resistant bacteria as an outcome; and (ii) collected cultures at predefined time point(s) for surveillance (not clinically indicated) during follow-up. The specific inclusion criteria and search strategy can be found in Section S2.1 in <a href=\"#pmed.1004013.s002\">S2 Text</a> and Table A in <a href=\"#pmed.1004013.s002\">S2 Text</a>. The indications for antibiotic treatment in the trials included treatment or prevention of bacterial infections, decolonisation of resistant bacteria, and anti-inflammation for autoimmune diseases. The sites of colonisation included digestive, respiratory, and urinary tracts. We considered resistance carriage when the antibiotic prescribed in the trial was not effective against the specific type of resistance, e.g., ciprofloxacin was prescribed in a trial that monitored carriage of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria. No trials monitored resistance phenotypes, which the prescribed antibiotic was effective against.</p>\n",
       "<p>The specific aims of the systematic review were to (i) evaluate the quality of evidence in the current literature of antibiotic duration effects on resistance carriage; (ii) describe and summarise the findings from these studies; and (iii) compare the findings to the model outputs.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Meta-analysis</h3>\n",
       "<p>From the studies identified in the systemic review, we selected those that monitored resistant gram-negative bacteria carriage for a meta-analysis. The meta-regression analysis was performed using a Bayesian model to estimate the change in the daily risk of acquiring resistant bacteria colonisation per day of antibiotic consumption. The dependent variable in the meta-regression analysis was the number of patients colonised with resistant bacteria in a given arm of a given trial, together with the associated denominator. These data were analysed with a logistic regression using antibiotic duration administered to the patients in each arm and elapsed time from antibiotic administration to surveillance culture as independent variables. The regression model assumed each arm in each trial to be independent (fixed effect). Details of the models can be found in S2.4 Section in <a href=\"#pmed.1004013.s002\">S2 Text</a>.</p>\n",
       "<p>We also considered 2 other models. In the first alternative model, we included the healthcare setting as an additional independent variable. In the second, we allowed slopes and intercepts to vary between trials (random effect). Model comparison was done using the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC), where lower values indicate improved model fit [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>We implemented the meta-regression models in JAGS using the R2jags package [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>] and performed all analysis in R version 4.0.4 (2021-02-15) [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>].

Hence, for the ward population, the lower the prevalence of resistance carriage on admission, the greater effect antibiotic duration has on overall resistance.</p>\n",
       "<p>However, among patients who were treated and who were noncarriers on admission, reducing treatment duration tended to be more effective when the prevalence of resistance carriage on admission was high.

For the noncarriers, antibiotics increased the risk of acquiring resistant bacteria by reducing the abundance of colonising bacteria to below the carrying capacity. For the existing carriers, antibiotics preferentially promoted the growth of resistant bacteria, increasing these patients’ probability of transmitting resistance to others. Hence, higher transmission rates amplified the effect of treatment duration on increasing resistance carriers by bridging the transfer of resistance from the carriers to the at-risk noncarriers.</p>\n",

(i) Transmission rate (x-axis) and (ii) prevalence of resistance carriers admitted to the ward (y-axis) were varied while other parameters were fixed to explore the difference in proportion of resistance carriers between the wards administered long and short antibiotic duration (coloured pixels). Red, white, and blue pixels indicate that there were more resistance carriers in the long ward (i.e., shortening treatment duration was effective at reducing resistance carriers), no difference between the short and long ward (i.e., shortening treatment duration had no effect on resistance carriers), and more resistance carriers in the short ward (i.e., prolonged treatment duration was effective at reducing resistance carriers), respectively. The top and bottom rows describe the scenarios where administered antibiotics have activity against both susceptible and resistant organisms and only susceptible organisms, respectively.

Ten of these trials collected surveillance cultures for colonising bacteria during follow-up visits and were included in the qualitative synthesis. A meta-regression analysis was performed using 5 out of the 10 trials (<a href=\"#pmed-1004013-t001\">Table 1</a>). One was excluded because the antibiotic duration in the long arm and the follow-up time were very prolonged compared to the other studies (104 days treatment compared to 5 to 14 days, and 365 days follow-up compared to 3 to 41 days) [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>]. One was excluded because the trial reported a mixture of antibiotics and multidrug-resistant bacteria carriage without specifying if the organisms were gram-positive or gram-negative [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>]. Three others were excluded because the study only collected gram-positive bacteria in surveillance cultures [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>–<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>].

Six were performed in outpatient settings with mean follow-up periods ranging from 3 to 365 days; 4 were in hospital settings with mean follow-up periods ranging 28 and 90 days. Five trials enrolled only adults, while the other 5 enrolled only children. All were performed in high- or upper-middle-income countries. Antibiotic durations in the short arms ranged from 3 to 14 days (median 5 days), while in the long arms, the durations ranged from 5 to 104 days (median 10 days).</p>\n",
       "<p>The meta-analysis found an odds ratio of acquiring gram-negative resistance carriage with one additional day of antibiotics of 1.08 (80% credible interval 1.04% to 1.12%).

However, all studies were assessed to be at low risk of bias due to deviation from intended interventions.</p>\n",
       "<h2>Discussion</h2>\n",
       "<p>The 3 models reached broadly similar conclusions: Among treated individuals, shortening antibiotic duration is most effective at reducing resistance carriage when the bacterial dynamics respond rapidly to antibiotic treatment. When stopping antibiotics leads to rapid decline in the resistant strain’s abundance, shortening duration is more likely to result in a substantial reduction in the prevalence of resistance [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]. At a population level, high transmission of resistant bacteria between hosts was a key factor in the efficacy of shortening treatment duration at reducing resistance carriage.</p>\n",
       "<p>Longer antibiotic treatment may decrease or increase the prevalence of resistance carriers, depending (among other factors) on the availability of effective antibiotics against particular resistance phenotypes. The meta-analysis, using data from randomised controlled trials, highlighted the increased incidence of resistance colonisation with treatment duration when there was no effective antibiotic treatment available. The models also showed that even when antibiotics administered are active against a resistance phenotype, longer duration may increase resistance carriers especially among the treated individuals and noncarriers when the prevalence of resistance carriers on admission and transmission rates are high.</p>\n",
       "<p>We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for modelling studies that evaluated antibiotic treatment duration on antimicrobial resistance and found 3 related publications. The first study by D’Agata and colleagues is a theoretical agent-based model, which concluded that rapid initiation of treatment and minimising duration were likely to reduce antimicrobial resistance in a hospital epidemic setting [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>]. The second study by D’Agata and colleagues focused on within-host dynamics of resistance by effective and ineffective antibiotic killing [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>]. It found that shorter and early interruption of antibiotic therapy selected resistant strains when antibiotic killing was effective. The other study is by Blanquart and colleagues, in which antibiotic prescription and antimicrobial resistance data specific to <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> from the Israeli community were used [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>]. This study suggested that reducing the number of courses of antibiotics might be a more efficient strategy for reducing antimicrobial resistance than reducing treatment duration. There were no studies that directly addressed the relationship between antibiotic duration and antimicrobial resistance in both individual and population levels specific to healthcare settings.</p>\n",
       "<p>We did not find any cluster-randomised trials of antibiotic duration that monitored resistance colonisation at the population level. Such trials would have allowed us to compare the individual versus population effects from antibiotic selection. Since most resistance selection in common bacterial pathogens is due to “bystander” selection [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref045\" class=\"ref-tip\">45</a>], trials that only look at resistance in bacteria that are causing infections being treated are potentially missing a big part of the picture. Future trials should collect surveillance cultures to evaluate the effect of duration on resistance carriage.</p>\n",
       "<p>The modest effect of shortening antibiotic duration on reducing resistant bacteria colonisation can be partially explained by the unique patient and antibiotic prescribing characteristics in healthcare settings. These include typically short lengths of stay and a slow rate of decolonisation of resistant bacteria in those previously exposed to antibiotics [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]. Admitted patients under antibiotic treatment acquiring resistant bacteria carriage can thus remain as carriers during relatively brief hospitalisation periods even after antibiotic treatment is stopped. This initial rapid increase in risk of acquiring resistance bacteria carriage during the first few days of antibiotic treatment could reduce the effectiveness of shortening treatment duration at reducing resistance.</p>\n",
       "<p>Our findings highlight an important interaction between shortening antibiotic treatment and reducing transmission of resistant bacteria through infection prevention and control. This is intuitive because in addition to selecting for within-host resistance, antibiotic use also increases the risk of colonisation with resistant bacteria and subsequent prolonged colonisation [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]. Shortening treatment duration has the potential to reduce a patient’s risk of acquiring resistant bacteria, while infection prevention and control measures reduce transmission of resistant bacteria to these at-risk patients.</p>\n",
       "<p>There are important caveats and limitations in our study. Firstly, despite performing a comprehensive systematic review, some parameter values were not available in the literature or were taken from animal or in vitro experiments. In such cases, we explored the largest reasonable range of parameter values. Secondly, emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance under antibiotic selective pressure are complex and cannot be fully described with any of the models presented. It is reassuring, however, that all 3 versions of the models produced similar conclusions. Thirdly, for the meta-analysis, there were few antibiotic duration trials that monitored resistance carriage as an outcome. This contributed to large credible intervals in the daily resistance colonisation risk with antibiotic treatment. These limitations highlight important gaps in existing literature and the conduct of antibiotic duration trials. Fourthly, our models did not account for de novo mutations during treatment, which are an important source of resistance for certain organisms such as <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> [<a href=\"#pmed.1004013.ref046\" class=\"ref-tip\">46</a>]. Instead, we focused on pathogens in which colonisation with resistant phenotypes is primarily acquired through transmission and horizontal gene transfer. These are highly clinically relevant gram-negative bacteria such as carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales, extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales, and carbapenem-resistant <em>Acinetobacter</em> spp. Lastly, the agent-based models captured both individual and population-level effects of antibiotic selection pressure. However, the trials included in the meta-analysis were individually randomised, and results therefore reflected only the direct individual antibiotic selection effects.</p>\n",
       "<p>Understanding the key factors driving the effect antibiotic duration on resistance carriage will inform future research study designs, antimicrobial stewardship interventions, and resource allocation in the overall control strategies. The practical implications from our findings are that interventions for shortening antibiotic treatment duration are potentially most effective when antibiotics are stopped as early as feasible without compromising treatment success for the target pathogen, especially in high transmission settings.</p>\n",

       "<p>Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common surgically managed valvular heart disease and the third most common cardiovascular disease in Western countries [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>]. In our regional setting, prevalence in individuals ≥ 65 years is 3%, but increases exponentially with age to reach 7.4% in people &gt; 85 years [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. As life expectancy rises, it is estimated that case numbers in people &gt; 70 years of age will double or triple in the coming decades [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>Severe AS, if untreated, is associated with high mortality [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. In the absence of useful pharmacological treatments, the only effective treatments are aortic valve replacement (AVR) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. The therapeutic decision should take into account the clinical characteristics of the patient, the feasibility of the intervention, local experience and outcomes, and the individualized surgical risk and likelihood that the intervention will improve survival and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>Quality of life (QoL) can be defined as a multidimensional element that includes physical, psychological, cognitive, and social factors that affect how a person performs their activities and self-perceived degree of well-being [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>]. QoL assessments monitor the impact of a disease (and/or treatment) on a patient’s personal and social performance and are widely used in clinical practice, and SF-12 is one of the most widely used instruments [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. This questionnaire provides a generic measurement of general health and well-being and summarizes physical and mental components in 12 items divided into 8 health domains [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>Knowledge of the impact of AS on patients’ QoL in the population setting is still scant. Few studies evaluate QoL in patients with symptomatic severe AS, and these are mostly limited to assessing QoL after surgery (AVR or TAVI) or in patients receiving palliative treatment in whom surgical intervention has been ruled out. Only 1 study in the Netherlands reported that QoL is lower in patients with symptomatic AS [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>], but no studies have been conducted on the impact of AS on QoL in the Spanish population. Since the onset of AS symptoms is progressive but slow [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>], and patients are elderly with associated comorbidities [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>], this could lead to overlook the impact of AS on QoL and the need of surgery. As per current guidelines, patient-related QoL should be considered during the decision on the best treatment option [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. Indeed, assessing patients’ QoL can promote and provide evidence for patient-centered care [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>The aim of this study was to assess the impact of symptomatic severe AS on QoL in patients &gt; 65 years, compared to a control group in the same primary care setting, taking into account all cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and associated comorbidities.</p>\n",

Controls, without known AS, were recruited from the same primary care center as the cases and matched by age (± 5 years) and sex, in a 1:3 ratio.

A non-commercial version of this questionnaire was used, under license number QM021812.

       "<p>Continuous variables were characterized using mean and standard deviation, and categorical variables with absolute and relative frequencies.

Statistical methods were conducted as previously reported [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. Briefly, a two-step approach was used. First, potential confounding variables (CVRF, comorbidities) were analyzed at a baseline model. All variables with a p-value &lt;0.2 were selected and their input was carried out using forward and backward variable selection algorithms. Next, the model was readjusted testing those factors that remained in the limit area of p &lt;0.1. Final model was adjusted by age, sex and all significantly associated comorbidities and CVRF.</p>\n",
       "<p>The strength of the association of the 8 dimensions of the SF-12 questionnaire with the dependent variable was studied using the crude odds ratio with its 95% confidence interval (CI). The independent involvement of each dimension of the questionnaire with severe AS was estimated with the adjusted odds ratio (aOR), where the dependent variable was case/control and the independent variables were the results of the QoL test. Finally, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated to determine the sensitivity of the models created. All analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical package 15.0 and R, and significance level was set at 0.05.</p>\n",

       "<p>Next, we adjusted our model for all CVFR and comorbidities significantly associated with severe symptomatic AS.

A statistically significant inverse association was observed between the physical function and social function dimensions (p = 0.002 and p = 0.005) and an A multiple logistic regression model was constructed to evaluate the QoL in severe AS patients, adjusted for any variables that were significant in the baseline model inverse association close to significance (p = 0.052) was found between the physical role and severe AS (<a href=\"#pone-0287508-t003\">Table 3</a>).

       "<h2>Discussion</h2>\n",
       "<p>There is a clear association between symptomatic severe AS and lower self-reported perception of QoL. In this study, patients with AS scored lower than controls in all QoL domains of the SF-12 questionnaire, also when adjusted for CVRF and comorbidities. In the final multiple logistic regression model, we observed a significant association between physical function and social function and AS and an almost statistically significant association with physical role after controlling for other CVRF and comorbidities.</p>\n",
       "<p>Several tools are available for assessing QoL in the general population and in patients with specific chronic diseases. Disease-specific QoL scales focus on areas of life most affected by the disease and therefore have a higher sensitivity and specificity than general scales. However, the advantage of generic QoL instruments is that they can be used in different types of patients and populations and they can compare the relative impact of different diseases and obtain reference population values. Since no specific QoL scales for AS were available at the moment of initiation of the study, the generic SF-12 questionnaire was used in this study.</p>\n",
       "<p>The SF-12 questionnaire measures general health and well-being and covers 8 domains: physical function, which addresses limitations in daily life due to health problems; physical role limitations due to physical problems; bodily pain, which evaluates the frequency of the pain and how it interferes on an individual level; overall health, which measures the individual’s perception of their general health status; vitality, which assesses energy and fatigue levels; social function, which measures the extent to which health status interferes with social activities; limitations in emotional role activities due to emotional problems; and mental health measured by psychological distress [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. The results of this study show that severe AS affects all dimensions of patients’ QoL.</p>\n",
       "<p>Published data on the impact of AS on patients’ QoL are scarce. In fact, only one study comparing the QoL of patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic severe AS with the general population in 3 age groups (41–60 years, 61–70 years, and &gt; 70 years) has been conducted. This study found that QoL is lower in patients with symptomatic AS [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. Our results are in line with these data and show that the QoL of patients ≥ 65 years with symptomatic severe AS is lower than that of controls. In contrast with van Geldorp <em>et al</em>., after adjusting for CVRF and comorbidities, only two SF-12 questionnaire dimensions were associated with AS (physical function and social function) and one, almost statistically significant, was considered clinically relevant (physical role). These associations could help identify QoL issues in patients who have few symptoms and, despite recommendation in current guidelines, are not referred for intervention.</p>\n",
       "<p>A lower self-perceived QoL appears to have no correlation with disease severity. According to van Geldorp <em>et al</em>., there is no relationship between the degree of stenosis and the PCS and MCS scores of the SF-36v2 questionnaire. However, QoL does correlate with symptoms, since asymptomatic patients report a QoL similar to that of the general population [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. Although everything points in this direction, it is not known whether the severity of symptoms is negatively correlated with self-perceived QoL, or what the specific weight of each symptom in the impact of AS on QoL might be. This is a question that should be investigated in prospective studies in the future.</p>\n",
       "<p>In recent years, the study of QoL in patients with severe AS has focused on evaluating improvement after an intervention (AVR and/or TAVI), or on assessing the QoL of patients receiving palliative medical treatment in whom any intervention has been ruled out [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>]. HRQoL should also be taken into account when assessing health status and may be a useful parameter in the therapeutic decision-making process [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>Current guidelines recommend earlier intervention in patients with severe AS, in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. Compared to conservative treatment, surgical intervention improves prognostic of these patients. Despite these recommendations, between 30% and 60% of patients are still not referred for aortic valve replacement surgery [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. Underestimation of the impact of aortic stenosis symptoms on quality of life may be one of the reasons of underestimation of surgical need in both types of patients. In this way, questionnaires such as SF-12 or EQ-5D may provide a quality of life measure that would complement the clinical data of patients and contribute to the improvement of therapeutic decisions [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>]. Given the differences observed in 3 of the SF-12 questionnaire dimensions (physical function, social function, and physical role), special attention to these items might mean that patients not otherwise considered for referral could be offered intervention [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>This study has some limitations. Some cases who were potential candidates to participate may have died, which could mean that cases that were included had a better prognosis, bolstering the positive value of the results obtained. Likewise, controls may have been potential undiagnosed cases, since AS may not have clinical manifestations, even at advanced stages. This assumption would also further strengthen the results. With regard to sample size, 3 controls could not be selected for some cases, so the final sample size was slightly smaller than planned (221 instead of 261), thus decreasing the precision and statistical power. Despite matching by age, cases were older than controls due to the wide range used for matching (± 5 years), but age was taken into account in all regression models used. The effect of the other major CVRF and comorbidities on the QoL of cases and controls was taken into account in the regression models, but some residual confounding effect cannot be ruled out. The fact that the study was limited to people over 65 years could influence the magnitude of the association of QoL and severe AS. Finally, the results may not be applicable to other geographic areas.</p>\n",
       "<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n",
       "<p>Individuals ≥ 65 years with symptomatic severe AS score worse in the 8 health dimensions and PCS and MCS of the SF-12 health questionnaire than paired controls. In the multiple logistic regression models, all SF-12 dimensions and summary components are inversely associated with symptomatic severe AS in people ≥ 65 years. In the final regression model, an inverse association between the physical function and social function dimensions of the SF-12 questionnaire is observed in severe AS. In all cases, the discriminative and predictive ability of the association of the SF-12 questionnaire dimensions with severe AS was good. The use of quality-of-life scales provides evidence for patient‐centered care and could improve the management of severe AS, reduce delayed referral and improve patients’ QoL.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n",
       "<p>Today, the nutritional, health, and economic value of medicinal plants, along with the role of 25% in the production of drugs in the world, has led to considerable attention to them [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>]. The country of Iran has a variety of plant species due to its climatic diversity. The genetic resources available in each country are one of the most valuable potential agricultural resources of that country. The main goal of studying the diversity between and within different plant populations and the relationship between germplasm collections is to finally use this information for the production and development of cultivars with better productivity than cultivated species [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. In general, genetics affects plant yield and secondary metabolites of medicinal plants, and the interaction of area×mass is very significant on the yield of total dry matter and plant and varies depending on the region and type of mass [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. Transferring masses and different species from one region to another as well as the forcing of the adaptation plant to the new environment can change the ratio of secondary metabolites and in some cases induce new medicinal metabolites [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>Climate, directly and indirectly, affects all factors affecting the environment and plant growth [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. Experiments conducted in recent years show the effective role of climatic factors on the distribution of plants [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>]. According to some studies, although the weather factor plays the most important role in the growth and distribution of plants, plants are developed through several different factors including climate, soil characteristics, and natural conditions [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>]. Sickleweed (<em>Falcaria vulgaris</em>) belongs to the <em>Falcaria</em> genus and the Apiaceae family and belongs to the Eudicots Clade. Although Sickleweed has been described as annual, biennial or perennial [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>], but according to the authors’ observations and evaluations, it was annual. Sickleweed is especially important because of its nutritional value and medicinal effects on the human body. This plant is usually consumed as a vegetable and is a common food in spring. It is recommended in traditional medicine books to treat skin wounds, stomach problems, liver diseases, and blood purification, and its therapeutic effects have been proven in modern medical science [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. The increasing recognition of the properties of this plant species and the increasing population growth along with the decrease in rainfall have put increasing pressure on this plant population that preventive actions should be done for the protection and breeding of this plant.</p>\n",
       "<p>There are different methods to investigate the diversity between different plant samples; one of the cheapest and most common methods is the morphological diversity investigation. Although morphological diversity is influenced by environmental conditions compared to molecular diversity, it is widely used in different plants. Identification of morphological diversity is not only useful in the management of plant germplasms but also provides a good idea to researchers for plant breeding [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. Moreover, one of the important goals of medicinal plants is to select populations with high levels of secondary metabolites and increase the number of important compounds in these plants, which is possible by identifying effective physiological and biochemical parameters and knowing the relationships between plants and environmental factors [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>]. Geographical and climatic factors are effective in the production of secondary metabolites and morphological characteristics of medicinal plants. Although effective substances are made by guiding genetic processes, their production is significantly influenced by environmental factors such as light, temperature, and altitude. Environmental factors affect the total amount of effective substances, their constituent elements, dry weight production, and plant morphology [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>Various studies have been conducted in the field of investigating biochemical and physiological traits under the influence of various factors such as different regions, different environmental conditions, etc., in different medicinal plants [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]. In the case of the medicinal species Satureja, Spear Thistle, Persian hogweed, and chicory, it was shown that there is a direct relationship between the increase in height and the amount of phenolic and flavonoid active substances [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. In the study of the genetic diversity of the this population with SCoT molecular marker and morphological traits, the population was divided into three and two groups based on the markers and traits, respectivlley [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>Research have revealed that there might be significant regional variation in the biochemical characteristics of different plants. For instance, it has been discovered that arid regions with little rainfall and high temperatures have higher levels of medicinal plants in terms of their total phenolic and flavonoid content, antioxidant activity, and essential oil content. The influence of environmental elements like temperature, rainfall, and soil type can be used to explain the diversity in the biochemical characteristics of medicinal plants across various geographical areas [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>So far, not much study has been done in the world and Iran regarding the evaluation of morphological traits of different populations of sickleweed plants and the determination of their morphological identification. The biochemical and physiological traits of sickleweed vary across different populations, depending on the environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall, soil type, and altitude. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of geographical origin on populations and to investigate the diversity between populations, as well as to identify the best populations with breeding potential with the highest yield in terms of important traits such as essential oil, and physiological and biochemical traits. In addition, the use of this information is for creating a future protection program to prevent them from becoming extinct.</p>\n",

       "<p>The 15 different plant samples (<a href=\"#pone-0287480-t001\">Table 1</a>) were collected from seven provinces of Iran. These seven provinces include Ardabil, Kurdistan, Kermanshah, Gilan, Hamedan, Qazvin, and Qom so the number of selected regions was different for each province. For each population in each region, 10 different samples were selected and considered as replicates. In addition, the evaluation of traits and measurements was performed on these samples, and studies were conducted based on a nesting design with an unbalanced number of regions. In each area, the distance of the samples from each other was at least 10 meters to avoid interference from the samples.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Sample preparation</h3>\n",
       "<p>The leaves of the plants were collected in the vegetative stage of the Sickleweed plant in the early and mid-spring of 2021, and the fresh leaves were placed in foil after harvesting, placed in liquid nitrogen, and transferred to the laboratory for use in the next experiments such as percentage of essential oil, measuring physiological and biochemical traits based on methods described by Sudhakar et. al, [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>].</p>\n",

The absorbances are read at 663 nm, 645 nm, and also at 480 nm in a spectrophotometer and the concentration of pigments is mg/g fresh weight.

       "<p>The Bates et al. method [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>] was used to measure the proline content of leaves. Initially, 2 ml of the supernatant after centrifuging the extract was combined with 2 ml of the reagent ninhydrin and 2 ml of pure acetic acid, then the mixture was placed in an air bath at 100°C for 1 h. The tubes containing the mixture were then as soon as possible put in the ice bath. The mixture was then given 4 ml of toluene, and the tubes were thoroughly vortexed. The tubes were stacked for 15 to 20 min to create two distinct layers. Proline concentration was determined using the toluene and proline-containing upper color phase. The absorbance was determined at 518 nm and the amount of proline was calculated using a standard curve.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Protein</h3>\n",
       "<p>The proteins were extracted from the aerial parts at a temperature between 0°C and 4°C in ice water with phosphate buffer. Then, the Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) G-250 was used to give a consistent blue color. After 25 min, the absorbance was read by a spectrophotometer at 595 nm. Protein concentrations were calculated using a standard curve to measure the amount of total protein by Bradford’s method [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>].</p>\n",
       "<h3>Reducing sugars</h3>\n",
       "<p>In a Chinese mortar, 0.02 g of the plant’s aerial section was ground with 10 ml of distilled water and heated on an electric stove. Once the solution had boiled, the heat was turned off, and filter paper was used to collect the solution. Test tubes were filled with 2 ml of the produced extract, and two milliliters of copper sulfate solution, and then the test tubes’ ends were sealed with cotton before being submerged in a hot bath at a temperature of 100°C for 20 min. the 2 ml of the phosphomolybdic acid solution were added to the tubes once they had cooled, and after a short while, a blue tint emerged. The test tubes were then agitated ferociously with a vortex device to evenly spread the color throughout the test tube. Using a spectrophotometer and the standard curve, the absorbance intensity of the solutions at 600 nm wavelength was measured by the Somogyi method [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>] to show the amount of reducing sugars.</p>\n",

       "<p>The extraction of phenolic compounds was done according to Malik and Singh [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>] and the stages of preparation, extraction, etc. are shown in Sudhakar et. al, [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>]. The total amount of phenolic compounds were measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu method at 650 nm spectrophotometrically and expressed as mg phenols/100 g material.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Essential oil</h3>\n",
       "<p>The percentage of essential oil was also determined by distillation with water using Clevenger- type apparatus by the European Pharmacopoeia [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>], and after drying the water with the essential oil using dry sodium sulfate, the amount of essential oil was purified and then the percentage of essential oils was calculated relative to the dry weight.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Statistical analysis</h3>\n",
       "<p>Statistical analyzes including descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, and multivariate analysis were performed on the data. Descriptive statistics including mean, range, and standard deviation, etc. were performed on the average data of 15 populations, and the phenotypic coefficient variation (PCV) was calculated as follows for the studied traits.</p>\n",
       "<p>Before analysis, the variance of the data has checked for the correctness of the assumptions of the variance analysis, such as normal distribution of experimental errors, independence of experimental errors, uniformity of variances within the treatment, and the absence of interaction between treatment and provinces. After establishing these assumptions, the variance analysis of the data was carried out based on the unbalanced nested design, and Tukey’s test was used to compare the mean. In addition, the variance components were calculated based on the expected value of the mean square of the unbalanced nested design. The measured data for the essential oil percentage, protein, sugar content, and proline traits were very small, so the first data were multiplied by 100 and then the obtained data were used and the variance analysis was performed using SAS software version 9.4 [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>Multivariate analyses were used to investigate the genetic structure and grouping of populations and to identify kinship relationships between them. Grouping of sickleweed populations by using traits as well as grouping of the climatic regions by using bioclimatic parameters were done based on cluster analysis. The cluster analysis was done based on different methods and different distance criteria. Then, the distance method and the criterion that had the highest cophenetic correlation coefficient were selected and the grouping was done based on it. Finally, the distribution of the populations was also done by principal component analysis and the biplot method. The cluster analysis method and principal component analysis were done with PAST software [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref038\" class=\"ref-tip\">38</a>]. Determining the number of groups was done with the Factoextra [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>] package and R software.</p>\n",

       "<p>Nineteen bioclimatic indicators were measured and calculated for the collection locations in this study to investigate the geographic variety. The diversity and similarity of these areas were then assessed using various cluster analysis techniques and distance criteria. <a href=\"#pone-0287480-g001\">Fig 1</a> displays the outcomes of the cluster analysis for these areas. The findings demonstrated that these locations are divided into two groups using the Elbow technique and that they share similar weather patterns and bioclimatic data. The Elbow method uses a graphical representation to find the optimal number of clusters by Within-Cluster Sum of Square. The inertia is the sum of the squared distances from each point to the cluster center [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>]. In the first group were Seylatan and Qaleh Gah regions from Kurdistan province, Sahneh from Kermanshah, Deylaman from Gilan, Ilan from Qazvin, and Shaban from Ardabil, and in the second group were Kiyunanat and Bavaleh regions from Kermanshah, Panjeh Ali, Bolbanabad, Amirabad, Gerger-e Sofla and Nemat abad auliya from Kurdistan, Khalajastan from Qom and Chaharduli from Hamedan. The range of a species geographic distribution is a complex issue in population ecology that cannot be fully understood. Generally speaking, whether a species can survive in its native environment depends on how well an individual can meet biological needs such as dietary, physiological, and behavioral needs [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>]. Weather patterns and terrain, or more specifically, geographic diversity, have an impact on the quantity and richness of resources. The classic hypothesis of allopatric speciation postulates that physical obstacles like distances, lowlands, and heights, among others, can separate populations and lead to various trends in the variety of those populations [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>]. The alterations that distinct populations have endured along distinct evolutionary pathways may have resulted in a sort of superiority in reproduction and adaption to various places [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>]. Plants grown in arid regions with low rainfall and high temperatures may have higher percentages of essential oil due to the need to conserve water and prevent water loss through transpiration [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref045\" class=\"ref-tip\">45</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref046\" class=\"ref-tip\">46</a>].</p>\n",

       "<p>Because the purpose of studying genetic populations is to compare genotypes in terms of the amount of existing variation, This way, a range of data can be used for the initial comparison between the studied genotypes and get a general view of the amount of existing variation. Descriptive statistics including the minimum, maximum, and range of the studied traits are shown in <a href=\"#pone-0287480-t002\">Table 2</a>. The coefficient of variation parameter is one of the most important and valuable indices for estimating diversity in populations, and since this criterion is not affected by the trait measurement unit or its range, it is more important than other diversity criteria such as the range. Therefore, it is possible to make reliable selections to improve traits that have a higher coefficient of variation. Examining the phenotypic coefficient of variation of the traits showed that phenol, Chl. b and essential oil had the highest PCV. Therefore, these traits can be used in the breeding programs and effective selections can be made among the studied sickleweed populations to improve and breed these traits.</p>\n",

       "<p>In addition, the lowest PCV is related to protein traits, and the improvement of this trait will be less successful than other traits through selection in the studied population. According to the values of the PCV of the traits, it is observed that there is a favorable variation among the traits for most of them, and they can be used to improve the studied populations of sickleweed (<a href=\"#pone-0287480-t002\">Table 2</a>). The lowest PCV related to protein traits (0.23), and the highest related to phenol (16.45) and other traits were in this range. The reason for the high diversity of traits can be the environmental conditions and the different genetic backgrounds of the populations. The variation in leaf length trait and petiole length trait was more than other traits and therefore these traits can be considered by breeders because these traits play a role in stress tolerance.</p>\n",

Based on these results, considerable diversity is observed between populations and between provinces and these differences can be used to select the best population. In addition, for some traits, variation within the population was also observed, which sees from the results of the percentage of variance components for the source of error. Variation within the population for these traits was less than 8%. Therefore, the chance of selecting superior individuals within populations will be low due to low diversity.</p>\n",

The eigenvalues obtained from components 1 to 3 justified 97.6, 1.2, and 0.85% of the total variance, respectively. The coefficients of the eigenvectors obtained from the first component showed that the phenol trait was the most important trait for clustering in this component. In the second component, Essential oil and Carotenoids traits, and in the third component, Total Chl. and Chl. a traits were the most important traits. The distribution of the studied populations based on the first two components is shown in <a href=\"#pone-0287480-g003\">Fig 3</a>. The studied populations were divided into three groups.

Since the role of phenol in the first component and the role of essential oil and carotenoids in the second component was positive and effective. Therefore, the populations placed in the first area of the biplot are suitable populations for increasing the percentage of essential oil as well as carotenoids and phenol. In addition, biochemical and physiological traits play a role in stress tolerance, therefore the first area of the biplot of PC1 and PC3 is suitable.

       "<p>Population grouping by PCA was highly consistent with the grouping of cluster analysis. The results of this experiment showed that the number of studied traits is different in different regions. This diversity and difference in the amount of biochemical and physiological traits of sickleweed plants in different regions of Iran and other parts of the world can be caused by different weather factors (light, temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, etc.), geographical factors (geographical height, longitude, and latitude), soil conditions (soil texture, materials and nutrients) and genetic factors. Climatic conditions such as light, altitude, and average temperature have a great effect on the production of chemical compounds in horticultural and medicinal products [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref047\" class=\"ref-tip\">47</a>]. The amount and type of active substances in medicinal plants are determined by the guidance of both environmental and genetic factors [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref048\" class=\"ref-tip\">48</a>].</p>\n",

Separate studies have shown in different medicinal plants [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>] that biochemical and physiological trait are influenced by different collection areas, which is consistent with the results of this study. In the study of Crataegus oxyacantha plants, it was shown that the place of growth, height, and type of organ has a significant effect on the amount of phenol and flavonoids and it was found that at higher altitudes, more phenol and flavonoid compounds are produced in the plant [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref049\" class=\"ref-tip\">49</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref051\" class=\"ref-tip\">51</a>]. Of course, the difference in the quantitative amounts of phytochemical compounds, including phenolic and flavonoid compounds, among the populations of different regions can be caused by genetic diversity or ecological conditions governing the habitats [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref051\" class=\"ref-tip\">51</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref052\" class=\"ref-tip\">52</a>]. The choosing and developing plants with high medicinal potential, high yield, or resilience to environmental stress requires an understanding of the variance in biochemical and physiological properties of plants across different geographic and climatic locations. Understanding the ecological and evolutionary processes that influence plant diversity and environment adaption is also crucial [<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287480.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>].</p>\n",
       "<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n",
       "<p>Since the high level of proline and biochemical and physiological traits in plants can play a role in plants’ tolerance to stresses, therefore, populations with high values of these traits can be used in stress tolerance breeding programs. In addition, the essential oil of this plant is used in the treatment of diseases, and therefore populations Ard-Shaban and Qaz-Ilan, which showed a high percentage of essential oil and Gilan-Deylaman and Kur-Gerger-e Sofla were identified as superior populations that they can be used in breeding programs. In conclusion, due to the influence of climatic conditions including temperature, rainfall, soil type, and altitude, the biochemical and physiological characteristics of medicinal plants might differ dramatically across different areas. The therapeutic potential of medicinal plants is significantly impacted by the diversity in their biochemical and physiological characteristics. As a result, it’s critical to comprehend how diverse geographical areas affect medicinal plants and to build plans for their production and application in the pharmaceutical sector.</p>\n",

       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The treatment of clinical complaints with over-the-counter (OTC) products plays a substantial role in health care [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></span>]. Community pharmacists are often the first and only point of contact within the health care system for self-medication–related inquiries [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></span>]. Self-medication counseling by pharmacists can contribute to a cost-effective, individualized, safe medical care on the patient level and consequently to a relief of the burden of the entire health care system [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref3\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref4\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></span>]. External evidence is required for well-grounded consultations and a key factor within the 3-fold evidence-based pharmacy (EbPharm) concept, which derived from evidence-based medicine [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref5\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></span>]. Apart from external evidence, the pharmacist’s practical experience and the patient’s preference should be considered when counseling [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref6\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref7\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></span>]. However, a lack of information sources, time, and search skills has been identified as common barriers to EbPharm [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref8\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref18\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></span>]. Consequently, various evidence-based information resources were introduced to reduce the evidence-to-practice gap. Among all information sources, electronic sources are of increasing importance for pharmacists [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref19\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref20\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></span>]. The majority of information sources are however not targeted for community pharmacists, especially not in the context of self-medication counseling [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref21\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref29\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></span>]. The EVInews project is an example for an electronic, evidence-based self-medication–related information platform for community pharmacists in Germany [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref30\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Little is known about the quality and the kind of electronic information sources that pharmacists use for evidence-based self-medication counseling.

Several attempts have been made to measure the quality of electronic information sources through validated instruments [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref33\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref39\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></span>]. Standard categories of these instruments address an information source’s transparency, accuracy, completeness, and readability for instance [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref40\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></span>]. These instruments help identify valid information among the increasing body of available electronic data. Previous instruments, as a limitation, were only used for patient-oriented websites.</p>\n",

       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Our aim was to investigate the quality of community pharmacists’ web-based search results for self-medication–related content when using the internet in comparison with the EVInews database, based on an adjusted quality score for pharmacists. Furthermore, this study attempted to explore what types of web-based sources are used for evidence-based self-medication counseling and how much time is needed under everyday practice conditions.</p>\n",

       "<h4>Study Design</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A quantitative, unblinded, prospective randomized controlled trial including a web-based survey with an unblinded search task and a parallel study design was carried out between February 1, 2021, and April 30, 2021. The survey and data collection were conducted using SoSci Survey, Leiner DJ (version 3.1.06). Participating pharmacists were automatically assigned through the randomization function of the software in a 1:1 allocation ratio to either study group after giving their informed consent.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Study Population and Setting</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Community pharmacists across Germany within 5 different federal pharmacy chambers (Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower Saxony, and Saxony) were invited via an email to participate remotely and anonymously without any incentives. For this purpose, invitations containing the survey were sent via email to all community pharmacies that agreed to receive survey invitations and were listed in the email list of each federal pharmacy chamber. The completeness rate of the survey and time needed for completion were assessed through the SoSci Survey software. A reminder email was sent after 1 month if less than 15 participants within a pharmacy chamber were enrolled. Participants had to be licensed pharmacists to be included in the study.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Study Groups</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Participants were instructed to solely use either web-based information sources of their choice except for the EVInews database (web group) or exclusively the EVInews database (EVInews group). The EVInews group accessed the database via the link provided [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref41\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></span>] and a test account.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Survey Structure</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The survey was divided into 3 main categories as follows: sociodemographic data, verification of 6 health-related statements with assigned information source type from 2 typical self-medication indications (search task), and self-evaluation of search skills and feedback.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Search Task</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Participants of both study groups were asked to verify 6 health-related statements from 2 typical self-medication indications (Table S1 in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app1\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 1</a></span>) with a quote and the corresponding information source (search task). Of the 6 statements, 3 belonged to the self-medication indications recurrent herpes labialis and female androgenetic alopecia, respectively<i>.</i> The indications were chosen deliberately because they require specific knowledge but are nonetheless relevant for everyday practice, and content was available in the EVInews database.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A video and a short written summary were presented to all participants to inform them about the study protocol. The 3 statements of each indication were then displayed in an alternating order based on the software’s Rotate Blocks function to the participants. This was used to prevent learning effects and therefore a distortion of the results. Participants were then instructed to copy and paste their quote and link of the information source that proved or disproved the correctness of each statement in designated textboxes.</p>\n",
       "<h4>The EVInews Database</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The EVInews project was launched in 2017 and is based on the resolution of the Federal Union of German Associations of Pharmacists (ABDA) to help implement EbPharm into everyday practice. It consists of a website with general EbPharm information, monthly published newsletters, and a corresponding document-oriented database, which are free of charge. Once registered, users can access the database through a login. Independent pharmacists from the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at Leipzig University compose the newsletters with editorial assistance from AVOXA—Media Group German Pharmacist GmbH.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Quality Score</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">An adjusted quality score was used to assess the information sources that were used for the search task. Therefore, a rating scheme for the evaluation of the search task was created (Table S2 in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app2\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 2</a></span>).</p>\n",
       "<h4>Rating Scheme</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Rating scheme criteria were chosen and adapted based on validated quality scores and questionnaires reported in the literature [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref35\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref37\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></span>] as well as previous findings [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref32\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref39\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref42\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref44\" rel=\"footnote\">44</a></span>]. The rating scheme consists of 18 nominal- to ordinal-scaled criteria that address predefined quality standards. We selected existing and added new criteria that were relevant for the search task. The rating scheme criteria were grouped together in the categories “transparency,” “quality of evidence,” and “usability” for the information sources and “accuracy” for the evaluation of the quotes. Each quote’s accuracy was evaluated subjectively with regard to logic, rationale, and comprehension and objectively based on a summative content analysis. Of all items, 12 had a dichotomous response format and 6 had an ordinal response format.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Quality Assessment Procedure</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Participants’ quotes and sources were independently evaluated by 2 evaluators (MR and JMA) based on the rating scheme and merged after analysis completion. A total median was calculated based on the 2 different evaluations. The maximum quality score for a quote and information source for all 6 statements accounted to 180 points (ie, all criteria were fulfilled). Each rater was requested to provide reasons for point allocation.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Study Subgroups</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Because not all participants completed the search task of the survey, a subgroup analysis of these participants was performed as demonstrated in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure1\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 1</a></span>. Participants who chose at least 1 answer option including “I do not know” within the search task were defined as “met the eligibility criteria (‘all’).” Participants who chose 1 answer option and verified at least 1 statement with a quote and source were defined as “completed search task partially (subgroup ‘completed partially’).” Participants who verified all 6 health-related statements were defined as “completed search task fully (subgroup ‘completed fully’).”</p>\n",
       "<h4>General Study Procedure</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The study procedure is shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure2\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 2</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The survey consisted of 32 questions, which included close-ended and open-ended questions. Dichotomous, 4-point Likert scales and multiple-choice answer options were given. The level of measurement ranged from nominal- to ordinal-scaled data.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Outcome Parameters</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The primary outcome parameter was the difference in quality scores between the study groups. Secondary outcome parameters included a subgroup analysis, quality scores of the rating scheme categories of transparency, quality of evidence, and usability, the characterization of web-based information sources, a correlational analysis of sociodemographic characteristics and quality scores, a self-evaluation of search skills by the participants, and assessment of the time needed to perform the search task.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Sample Size</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The estimated sample size was calculated using the G*Power, software, Faul F, Erdfelder E, Buchner A, Lang AG (version 3.1). No information regarding the primary target distribution was available. Based on the results of a pilot test, a double-sided Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test for nonparametric, independent samples was used a priori to determine the required sample size for a significant difference in quality scores. At a significance level of α=.05 and a CI of 95%, a sample size of at least 44 pharmacists per group would provide a power of 1 – β=.80. We estimated attrition to be 50% and consequently strived for a greater sample size.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Data Analysis</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Only data of participants who processed the search task and did not violate the study protocol were included in the data analysis. The analysis was performed using Excel (versions 2105 and 2016; Microsoft Corp) and SPSS Statistics (version 25 and 26; IBM Corp). Results for the primary target parameter (quality score) were expressed as median and first and third quartile (Q<sub>25</sub>/Q<sub>75</sub>). They were compared using a 2-sided Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test for independent samples. The comparison of quality subscores was performed likewise with a Bonferroni correction. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the responses. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate the relationship between quality scores and sociodemographic data.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Quality Assurance Means</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">To ensure feasibility and exclude comprehension difficulties, pretests and pilot tests were conducted between October 26, 2020, and January 19, 2021. The pretests were carried out with 23 pharmacists. The first 12 pretests were executed using the think-aloud method, the remaining using the standard observation before the test. After a revision and adjustment of the survey and rating scheme, a pilot test with 37 pharmacists and advanced pharmacy students as pretesters was performed, resulting in minor modifications. Furthermore, to reduce subjective judgment on each quote’s suitability (item 4d within the rating scheme), 1359 relevant keywords in English and German were identified during the pretest phase and used for a summative content analysis. The frequency of these predefined keywords was measured through the Excel (Microsoft Corp) count function for each quote. To assess whether difficulties occurred during the completion of the search task, participants were asked to rate the clarity of this survey and give qualitative feedback if desired. Data generated by the pretest and pilot test were not included in this study.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Quotes and sources that were not analyzable based on the rating scheme by at least one of the evaluators were presented to an expert panel in May 2021. The expert panel consisted of 4 pharmacists specialized or mostly in continuing education to become a pharmacist with a focus on drug information, who were not involved in the EVInews project. Consensus-based point allocation was ultimately done by vote for the remaining uncertainties.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">To examine whether differences in rater performance were present, interrater reliability was assessed using the Cohen κ statistic. The Cohen κ coefficient for each item of the rating scheme and subsequently for all rating scheme items was calculated and compared with the qualitative interrater reliability descriptors by Landis and Koch [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref46\" rel=\"footnote\">46</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<h4>Ethics Approval</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Ethical approval for this study was granted by the ethics committee of the Medical Faculty of the Leipzig University (541/20-ek) on December 5, 2020.</p>\n",

       "<h4>Participant’s Characteristics</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The participant flowchart (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure1\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 1</a></span>) depicts the participants who have been enrolled.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The participant’s characteristics are summarized in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table1\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 1</a></span>. Of all 141 participants, 110 (78.0%) were female and 31 (22.0%) were male. The median age interval was between 41 and 50 years (31/141, 22.0%) and more than half of all participants had more than 11 years of work experience (79/141, 56.0%). A reminder email was sent to the members of the Pharmacy Chamber of Saxony because of a low response rate in the first round.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A Fisher exact test revealed no significant sociodemographic differences between the 2 study groups concerning gender, age, and academic degree.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Primary Outcome Parameter: Quality Score</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The median quality score of the Web group (n=71 pharmacists) was 32.8% (59.0 out of 180.0 points) and that of the EVInews group (n=70) was 85.3% (153.5 out of 180.0 points, <i>P</i>&lt;.001; <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure3\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 3</a></span>). The variability of the quality score in the Web group (IQR 23.0-80.5) was larger than that in the EVInews group (IQR 125.1-157.0). <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table2\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 2</a></span> displays all quality score results.</p>\n",

       "<h4>Secondary Outcome Parameters</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Results of the subgroup analysis of the subgroups entitled “completed partially” and “completed fully” are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table2\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 2</a></span> and illustrated in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure3\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 3</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Quality scores per rating scheme category were calculated and revealed statistically significant differences, as shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table3\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 3</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The web-based information sources that were provided by the participants for the search task varied greatly, as illustrated in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app3\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 3</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A total of 254 out of potentially 426 web-based information sources (6 statements × 71 participants) were given by 71 participants within the study arm of the web group to verify 6 health-related statements. A list of references was enclosed in 42.9% (109/254) of all web-based sources. Information about the author was provided in 69.7% (177/254) of all the web-based sources, and 34.3% (87/254) were published within the last 3 years (reference date February 1, 2021).</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The results of the correlational analysis are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table4\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 4</a></span>. A 2-tailed statistical significance was only detected for the positive correlation between the participant’s estimated annual frequency of searches and quality scores for both study groups and a negative correlation between the age, professional experience, and quality scores within the EVInews group.</p>\n",
       "<p><sup>a</sup>OTC: over-the-counter.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The responses of the self-evaluation (web group, n=44; EVInews group, n=58) were as follows. A total of 25% (11/44) of participants within the web group agreed fully that they were able to find the desired information in contrast to 71% (41/58) of the EVInews group. Furthermore, 46% (20/44) of the participants within the web group indicated that they conducted between no literature searches with literature databases such as MEDLINE via PubMed and 39% (17/44) to up to 12 per year in comparison with 40% (23/58) of the EVInews database users and 35% (20/58), respectively. Moreover, 39% (17/44) of participants of the web group estimated their search ability to find evidence-based self-medication information to be “rather good” and 5% (2/44) to be “very good.” Within the EVInews group, 59% (34/58) regarded their search ability to be “rather good” and 9% (5/58) to be “very good.” A total of 72% (42/58) of the EVInews group indicated that they were not familiar with the database before the study participation.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The times needed for the search task completion are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table5\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 5</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The median for the search task completion was 25.4 (IQR 12.7-43.5) minutes in the web group and 19.7 (IQR 13.6-28.4) minutes in the EVInews group. The completion times include participants who chose the escape option “I don’t know.”</p>\n",
       "<h4>Quality Assurance: Rater Performance</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The extent of agreement between the 2 raters measured using the Cohen κ statistic was “almost perfect” (κ=0.81-1) for the rating scheme items 1, 2, 4a, 4d-13, and 15-18. The extent of agreement on items 14 complied with “substantial agreement” (κ=0.780), items 3 and 4c with “moderate agreement” (κ=0.41-0.60), and item 4b with “slight agreement” (κ=0.077). All values were significantly different from zero (<i>P</i>&lt;.001). The extent of agreement in the form of an overall interrater descriptor for all rating scheme items accounted to κ=0.854.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Discussion\" data-label=\"Discussion\">Discussion</h3>\n",
       "<h4>Principal Findings</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">We found that the median quality score was significantly lower in the web group than in the EVInews group. Additionally, the variability of median quality scores in the web group was significantly larger and less participants completed the search task fully compared to the EVInews group. Web-based sources often did not meet standard quality requirements. The time needed for the search task completion did not reveal any considerable differences between the 2 groups. The data suggest that community pharmacists struggled to find web-based high-quality, evidence-based information sources for self-medication under everyday practice conditions.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Differences in Quality Scores and Potential Causes</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The web group obtained a significantly lower quality score with 32.8% of criteria fulfilled in comparison to 85.3% in the EVInews group. Several explanations for this result are possible. The statistically significant difference in quality scores may be explained by a lack of transparency information of many web-based sources, which ultimately resulted in lower scores. Examples of missing transparency information include publication dates, literature references, or authorship information. An analysis of the categories transparency and quality of evidence confirmed the persisting difference in scores in favor of the EVInews group.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Furthermore, a subgroup analysis was conducted because the difference in quality could be caused by participants who mostly chose the escape answer option “I don’t know.” A significant difference in quality scores remained when only data from participants, who verified all 6 health-related statements, were included.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The differences in quality scores between the participants could also be explained by personal factors such as different levels of work experience, knowledge, and the skills needed to quickly find suitable external evidence on the internet. However, significant differences in sociodemographic data between both groups were not existent. According to our correlational analysis, there was a positive association between the participant’s estimated annual literature searches and quality scores in both study groups. A negative correlation between the participant’s age as well as professional experience in years and quality scores was only observed within the EVInews group. This may indicate that with increasing practical literature search experience, the ability to find appropriate evidence could increase but with increasing age and professional experience decrease. The factors age and professional experience however only seemed to be associated with the quality scores of the EVInews group. It should be taken into consideration that EbPharm has been established in recent years, and therefore pharmacists who were trained over 30 years ago may not be familiar with this concept. Abu Farha et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref10\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></span>] similarly demonstrated a negative correlation among pharmacists between the familiarity with evidence-based medicine terms and professional experience.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Need for Customized Evidence-Based Information Sources for Pharmacists</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Most of the web-based information resources consisted of tertiary literature in the form of nonscientific pharmacy journals of varying quality and timeliness. Some information resources were 20 years old. Despite its simple nature as a document-oriented database, the majority of participants using the EVInews database “agreed fully” (41/58, 71%) in contrast to the web group (11/44, 25%) that they were able to find the desired information. Users need to sign in before accessing the EVInews database. The login with a username and password is comparable to other information platforms of this kind. This may be regarded as an obstacle to the database’s usage for everyday practice. However, when customers or other health professionals seek evidence-based advice related to OTC products, pharmacists may often not be able to immediately provide all the necessary information anyways. These cases require a search for external evidence under everyday conditions such as simulated in our study. The ability to find the desired information when confronted with such a search task is therefore of great importance and even greater importance than retrieval speed from our point of view. Nonetheless, it remains unknown how much low-quality sources impact the overall consultation quality. Furthermore, the dropout rate was greater in the web group. Only 22 participants within the web group in comparison with 46 within the EVInews group completed the entire search task and verified all 6 health-related statements.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Although the information retrieval times did not differ significantly, the participant’s search results under everyday practice conditions clearly did. An implication of this is the possibility that the participants were simply overwhelmed with the search task because they lacked the necessary search skills and therefore did not complete it fully. Subsequently, this leads to the question: what information do pharmacists rely on when selling OTC products if they cannot find it? These data may furthermore suggest that there is a need for training on how to find and appraise evidence as well as evidence-based information sources for community pharmacists. Because a lack of information sources and search skills is a common barrier to the implementation of EbPharm, information tools may help reduce the evidence-to-practice gap. The EVInews database fulfilled a majority of the standard quality requirements. Once further adjusted, it may be a promising electronic information tool for community pharmacists for evidence-based counseling.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Limitations</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A Hawthorne effect may have influenced the participants’ search behavior in both groups, prompting them to look for the very best evidence in the trial setting. Because of the web-based format, they were, however, not directly observed, and therefore this effect probably plays a minor role.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Raters and participants were not blinded. Because the type of information sources the users were allowed to use was predefined, blinding was not possible. To minimize subjective evaluation, a quantitative approach for the quality evaluation with objective criteria was chosen to ascertain a robust rating performance.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Only 2 OTC-relevant indications were chosen for the search task (Table S1 in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app1\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 1</a></span>). It remains questionable whether these 2 indications were adequate for the search task. Customers’ inquiries regarding the evidence or verification of advertising statements for the treatment of female androgenetic alopecia or recurrent herpes labialis are nonetheless common in everyday counseling practice and were therefore included in this study. Furthermore, on the basis of the pretests and pilot tests, we made sure that there is enough citable literature in German and English available to complete the search task.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The exclusion of tertiary print literature was due to technical difficulties when conducting the web-based survey. However, electronic information sources are frequently used among pharmacists nowadays, especially for the verification of health-related claims.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The rating scheme was not validated before the survey was conducted; hence extensive pretests and pilot tests were performed.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Conclusions</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Community pharmacists struggled to find high-quality electronic self-medication–related information sources under everyday practice conditions in the web group. This is of great importance as self-medication recommendations or simply the verification of statements should not be based on information resources of questionable quality. The search results of the EVInews group met many of the predefined standard quality criteria. Taken together, the findings suggest that there is a need for customized information sources for pharmacists. Evidence-based information tools such as the EVInews database may help in reducing the evidence-to-practice gap.</p>\n",

       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Several outbreaks of infectious viral diseases with high fatality rates have occurred over the last 20 years: COVID-19 (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus), the new avian influenza virus (ie, H7N9), and the respiratory syncytial virus. These have all caused high hospitalization rates [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref4\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></span>]. Immunocompromised patients are vulnerable to severe diseases caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and herpes zoster virus infections [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref5\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref8\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></span>]. Thus, a timely diagnosis is necessary for clinicians to determine the optimal treatment plan. Accordingly, rapid diagnoses with high fidelity comprise an important requirement for clinical virology laboratories.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The use of high-tech molecular technology for the rapid detection of pathogens in clinical specimens has gradually become the gold standard for clinical virological testing [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref9\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref10\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></span>]. Furthermore, quantitative or qualitative test analysis is used as an important indicator for medical diagnosis, treatment tracking, risk assessment, and health care information.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Molecular techniques are an important tool for clinical testing; however, the cost of molecular test reagents is high. Further, special and repetitive training is required to operate the testing equipment; consequently, clinical virology laboratories frequently prevent medical technology (MT) interns from practicing these procedures on their equipment. There are similar problems in teaching in other specialized areas involving clinical medical skills. For example, surgical training has always relied heavily on practical operations to ensure that physicians acquire the necessary technical proficiency to perform surgical procedures. After observing surgical procedures and animal experiments demonstrated by the teacher, intern surgeons practice the relevant technical skills while being supervised by the teacher. This teaching method may be limited by various factors, including medical ethics, working hours, and medical disputes. Therefore, scholars in the field of surgical teaching have recently developed simulation tools to teach residents to perform surgery. Virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality or tactile computer programs can simulate the surgical environment for teaching purposes and apply minimally invasive surgical robots [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref11\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref12\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Traditional teaching methods transmit medical knowledge via lectures and textbooks. However, many teachers have recently begun to introduce 2-way communication learning methods such as problem-based learning and flipped education. These methods aim to replace the prevalent unidirectional cramming teaching method by transforming students from passive to active agents; this can improve their learning effectiveness [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref13\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref17\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></span>]. Although each specialized field has its own special required skills and methods, clinical practice courses play a pivotal role in medical technologists’ development. Students must hone their practical skills to reduce their chance of failure in real-world settings. Therefore, the depth and breadth of students’ clinical training and whether they can actually engage in operational exercises will affect their learning.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The fully automatized BD MAX system developed by Beckton Dickinson Company integrates 2 functions: fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection and nucleic acid extraction. This detection system has 24 independent PCR heating elements, 5 different fluorescence channels, and can run different programs simultaneously. It processes 96-120 samples in 8 hours. It also has high efficiency for the detection of pathogens.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The BD MAX system is used in modern clinical virology laboratories for the detection of multiple clinical microbial nucleic acids present in emergent infectious pathogens. Although the BD MAX is powerful, the cost of reagents is high. Thus, clinical virology laboratories often prevent MT interns from practicing with their equipment. Schools often have scarce funds to obtain such advanced and expensive equipment for students to learn. Further, even if the students manage to understand the principles of the procedure after analyzing the operation manual and observing the workflow of a well-trained medical technologist, they often cannot access appropriate practical training. Therefore, it is critical to develop new teaching methods that allow MT students to put their skills into practice so that those who do not have the opportunity to engage in real-world practice with this specialized technology can still receive training.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">VR comprises a virtual environment that is similar to reality. Computer technology can simulate a high-fidelity space and allow users to immerse themselves inside that environment. In a VR environment, users wear a special display device (ie, VR headsets) to enter the simulation. In this space, the operator can use a controller or keyboard to interact with the virtual environment. Importantly, VR does not aim to replace real space. By combining a camera’s recognition technology and a computer program, a set picture appears in the lens, and the corresponding virtual objects appear. However, high-tech VR products have not yet been developed and used in the field of skill training for virological testing. Thus, this study designed and implemented a VR software to train MT students to use a high-level virological testing system (ie, BD MAX) and evaluated students’ learning effectiveness.</p>\n",

       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The proposed study was developed based on Oculus Rift and cross-platform Unity. Oculus Rift is a VR goggle developed and manufactured by Oculus VR. The Rift has 2 PenTile organic light–emitting diode displays and offers 1080×1200 resolution per eye, a 90-Hz refresh rate, and a 110-degree field of view. The device also features rotational and positional tracking as well as integrated headphones that provide a 3D audio effect. The separation of the lenses is adjustable using a slider on the bottom of the device to accommodate a wide range of interpupillary distances. The Rift allows for full 6-degrees-of-freedom rotational and positional tracking. Tracking is performed by Oculus’s Con.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Creating Course Features</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">We designed several virtual clinical and experimental scenarios for students to develop the relevant skills for virological testing in a realistic setting. By using VR, students can develop practical skills by engaging with interactive content, without being limited to merely reading about standard operating procedures.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Study Population</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Senior-year students from the Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology (ie, MT students) at the College of Medicine of National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) in Tainan, Taiwan enrolled in the Clinical Virology Internship Course. Of these, 31 MT students participated in a 2D VR cognitive test and a 3D VR practical simulation.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Cooperation Between the MT and Biomedical Engineering Groups in the Study</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The teachers of the MT department at NCKU were responsible for designing the lesson plan and questionnaires, as well as evaluating students’ learning effectiveness. The department of biomedical engineering (BME) was responsible for the development of the VR software. The VR-based training was carried out in the VR classroom of the BME department. System operation was carried out in the clinical virology room of the Pathology Department at NCKU Hospital.</p>\n",
       "<h4>The Cross-Disciplinary MT and BME Team</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Since March 2019, we have discussed the subject of VR-based teaching plans as well as clinical virology teachers’ needs and feedback on the VR software described in this study. The BME group adjusted and optimized the VR software for high-level clinical virological testing after regular brainstorming and discussion. As of June 2022, there have been a total of 45 meetings.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Design of the High-Level Clinical Virological Testing Lessons</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The BD MAX instrument is an automatic virus nucleic acid detection system and was selected as the basis for our VR project. It is currently used to detect a variety of microorganisms (eg, HSV, varicella-zoster virus [VZV], and cytomegalovirus) at the NCKU Hospital’s clinical virology laboratory.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The self-developed VR teaching software had both a test mode and a learning mode. The computer software registered students’ score and immediately provided them with detailed feedback on the results. Combined with the test items (which assessed students’ knowledge regarding HSV and VZV PCR), a series of matching tasks was designed to prepare learners to interact with the VR environment. The difficulty level of the items was measured by the frequency of drag-and-drops (the term “drag” refers to the behavior of sliding the button to the answer before actually selecting the answer in the VR scenario) when students attempted to answer a given item. There were 10 items designed on the usage of BD MAX. The user activity diagram of the proposed research is shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure1\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 1</a></span>, and the detailed flowchart of each mode is shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure2\" rel=\"footnote\">Figures 2</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure6\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></span>. The user manual is shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app1\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 1</a></span>. Items 1-10 are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure7\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 7</a></span>, and the picture of VR scenario is shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure8\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 8</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The virology (MT) group provided a video of the actual operation process using the BD MAX system (while detailing each used component) to the BME team to create a high-fidelity 3D VR component. We recorded the virological testing process or an introduction to the structure of the automatic testing system. We also used computer software to divide the procedure’s steps on BD MAX and performed the procedures. We disassembled the steps of the practical procedure, and the design internship students could control the 3D objects to simulate the experimental process through the human-machine interface. The learners performed the entire practice process in a virtual learning setting. In the VR environment, there was a setting to prompt the learner to proceed to the next step so they could simulate the actual testing procedure. The interactive mode included using the hands in the VR simulation to place the objects in the correct position: a special color was displayed if the order was correct. A warning was displayed if the order or position was wrong—students were instructed to try again until they were correct. Real scenarios are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure9\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 9</a></span>A and <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure10\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 10</a></span>A. 3D VR scenarios are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure9\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 9</a></span>B and <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure10\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 10</a></span>B.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">After all the virtual scenarios were tested, the VR classroom provided learners with a virtual space for learning and interaction.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Our research team used the concept of software reliability to test the VR software’s stability. First, we developed a test plan to analyze each functional requirement, the expected trigger function, and whether the results were correct. The failure status of the software was defined according to 3 levels (high, medium, and low). Reliability coverage testing was subsequently performed. Coverage tests were conducted for input domain behavior, input variables, and their combinations, as well as various usage functions. After the tests were completed, we wrote a test report based on the failure condition and its definition and then made the necessary corrections. Medium- and high-level risks were completely resolved before the VR software was presented to users for testing. The users were finally allowed to use the VR software.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Ethics Approval</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The Institutional Review Board of NCKU Hospital approved the study (B-ER-109-432). All of the students were informed about the aim and protocol of the study, and written informed consent was obtained from all of them.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Learning Effectiveness Evaluation</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The levels of the Kirkpatrick model were used to investigate reaction, learning, and behavior of the students (trainees). We designed questionnaires of VR application learning effectiveness evaluation for participants to fill out anonymously, including the “satisfaction of using different learning materials” (reaction level) and the “self-assessment questionnaire of participants’ knowledge application” (behavior level). The score of the item in the questionnaires was as follows: very disagree got 1 point, disagree got 2 points, no comment got 3 points, agree got 4 points, and very agree got 5 points. Questionnaires of behavior level were conducted during pre- and posttraining. We also used 10 items of “cognitive test and learning” lessons (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure7\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 7</a></span>) for written tests with registered identification number to evaluate learning level of students’ background knowledge of HSV or VZV and the operations of BD MAX. The score of each item was as follows: 11 points in item 1, 16 points in item 2, 7 points in item 3, 6 points in item 4, 3 points in item 5, 3 points in item 6, 6 points in item 7, 1 point in item 8, 6 points in item 9, and 6 points in item 10. A total score of 10 items was 65 points and was adjusted to 100 points afterward. These 10 items of written tests were tested at pretraining, posttraining after traditional demonstration teaching, and posttraining after VR teaching.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Statistical Analysis</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">SPSS for Windows (version 17.0; SPSS Inc) and SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) was used for statistical analysis. Quantitative data of “satisfaction of using different learning materials” (reaction level) are presented as mean values with 95% CI. We used nonparametric methods to analyze nonnormal distribution data in this study. Comparisons of pretraining, posttraining after demonstration teaching, and posttraining after VR teaching were scored via written tests and analyzed via Friedman’s test with posthoc analysis, that is, the Dunn-Bonferroni test. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to analyze the differences in the “self-assessment questionnaire of participants’ knowledge application” on pretraining and posttraining; the Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons adjustment.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Results\" data-label=\"Results\">Results</h3>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">From August 2021 to January 2022, 31 students from the Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology at NCKU in Taiwan used the novel self-developed VR software for 2D VR cognitive testing and 3D VR practical training for BD MAX. In total, 3 of them did not fill out the self-assessment questionnaire for behavior application.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Kirkpatrick Level I (Reaction): Evaluating Trainees’ Satisfaction</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">We designed 4 questionnaires to evaluate trainees’ satisfaction and identify their interest in learning. Assessments of the VR teaching material, the design fluency of the VR content, and the improvement in participants’ professional ability were included in the content. The contents of the items are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table1\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 1</a></span>. The students’ feedback showed that the use of 2D+3D VR teaching materials met students’ needs and enhanced their interest in learning. The item “VR-based teaching materials can increase my interest in learning” exhibited the highest scores in posttraining satisfaction. The results of posttraining satisfaction are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table1\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 1</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p><sup>a</sup>VR: virtual reality.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Kirkpatrick Level II (Learning): Determining the Trainees’ Learning Attainment</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">We designed 10 items (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure7\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 7</a></span>) to assess students’ background knowledge of HSV or VZV and the operations of BD MAX. There were included in the written tests and 2D VR teaching scenarios. The 3D VR teaching scenarios of the workflow of BD MAX procedures were developed. Written tests assessed students’ knowledge at pretraining, posttraining after exposure to traditional demonstration teaching, and posttraining after exposure to 2D+3D VR teaching. In the analysis of the learning hierarchy, it was found that the average score of 2D+3D VR teaching posttraining was higher than that for traditional demonstration teaching, and the learning effect was significantly better. The data are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure11\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 11</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Kirkpatrick Level III (Behavior): Assessing Trainee’s Knowledge Application</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">We designed 5 questionnaires to assess trainees’ knowledge application. The dimensions assessed included interpretation of the results and quality control; familiarity with the BD MAX procedure; understanding the principles, structure, and function of the BD MAX instrument; familiarity with the examination types, containers, transport, and storage conditions; and understanding virological testing’s clinical significance and possessing pertinent background knowledge. The results of participants’ self-assessment pre- and posttraining showed that trainees exposed to VR training to learn about high-level virological testing (using BD MAX) had significantly improved their detailed knowledge posttraining, vis-à-vis pretraining (<i>P</i>&lt;.001). The data are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure12\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 12</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<h4>The 2D Cognitive Software Analyzed the Number of Attempts Before the Correct Answer</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Our team designed a function of the 2D VR teaching software to record the “drags” (ie, attempts) for each item. The drags for each question were recorded and analyzed. The results showed that the higher the interns’ average score, the fewer drags they exhibited. We used this function to assess items’ difficulty level and used it as a reference for adjusting each lesson’s items (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure13\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 13</a></span>).</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Discussion\" data-label=\"Discussion\">Discussion</h3>\n",
       "<h4>Main Findings</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The use of VR software for teaching has become more popular in clinical medicine. Here, we designed and implemented a VR software for advanced MT training. The participants’ posttraining learning scores increased significantly after being exposed to 2D and 3D VR training. Participants exhibited significantly improved cognition of high-level virological testing posttraining. We analyzed the difficulty of the items and used it as a reference for adjusting them. Participants exposed to VR-based training considered that the VR-based teaching materials met their needs and enhanced their interest in learning.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Developing practical skills is paramount in the field of MT. MT students’ skill-development process begins in the basic experimental courses of natural science during their freshman and sophomore years and continues in the advanced experimental courses related to clinical testing in their junior year as well as the clinical courses in their senior year. MT interns perform more experimental operations than other departments in the medical field. The basic experimental practices performed in school differ significantly from clinical practice courses. In school, the designed laboratory course comprises relatively simple experiments for the students, considering the availability of equipment and resources. However, in the clinical virology practice course of the hospital, additional factors come into play, including the urgency of clinical work, the timeliness and accuracy of reports, the expensive cost of reagents, the complexity of instruments, and the limited number of specimens from patients. Therefore, MT beginners and students rarely have the opportunity to practice in real-world settings.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Due to the rapid development of molecular methodologies, the time required to detect viruses decreased significantly, from several days to 4-6 hours. Current detection procedures can detect multiple pathogens simultaneously, thus, becoming an invaluable tool for the clinical diagnosis of pathogenic infections [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref9\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref10\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref18\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref21\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></span>]. However, the test reagents required to detect multiple pathogens simultaneously are expensive (the cost of 1 test is about US $30), and the costs associated with the equipment are also high. The personnel require specialized training to operate the test instrument. Therefore, it is not possible for medical technological interns to practice in hospitals’ clinical virology laboratories. However, schools are also limited by the lack of proper funding, which makes it difficult for them to obtain advanced and expensive instrument for students to practice. Therefore, many intern students are limited to learning from the operation manuals and observing the operation of well-trained medical examiners. Therefore, it is important to use computer technology to develop new teaching methods that allow MT students who do not have access to this specialized technology to receive adequate training.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Mikropoulos et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref22\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></span>] investigated students’ views on VR learning and found that students generally held positive views regarding the use of VR in teaching while also verifying that VR can capture and maintain students’ attention. Many students expressed that it was exciting to be able to walk in and interact with the 3D VR world. VR simulation allows one to walk inside a molecule to study it in detail or, in the case of a block model, we can acquire a global perspective of a given city block at a distance. This allows the learner to develop a better understanding of the connections between the buildings, open space, and streets. Thus, VR will undoubtedly change the way we look at things and could even allow us to discover things that were previously unimaginable. It could also help people with disabilities break through their physical limitations and engage more actively in learning with their peers.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Of course, not all situations are suitable for the use of VR for education. Pantelidis [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref23\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></span>] established the following recommendations regarding the appropriate use of VR: (1) VR would be useful when using real objects is dangerous, impossible, or inconvenient; (2) virtual environments can be taught and trained in the same way as real objects; and (3) interacting with a model is as fun as interacting with the real thing.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Under the conditions of these 3 points, it is recommended to use VR for teaching in clinical virology laboratories. This research project was consistent with all 3 aspects. The BD MAX reagents are expensive, and the number of specimens is limited; thus, it is inconvenient to use a real BD MAX for learning. Other instruments required for PCR molecular detection can be similar to the real object. For interns, working with VR itself is a fun and fresh experience. Therefore, this research project was suitable for simulation using VR. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref24\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></span>] launched a VR teaching video: Biosafety Cabinet Edition in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">In addition to the simulated surgical training, VR technology has also been used in baby breathing training, emergency simulation training, dental education, stroke rehabilitation, dental dexterity training, pharmacy teaching, pain management, web-based weight control training, and other clinical applications in the field of medicine and medical care [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref25\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref36\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></span>]. Although all VR devices have similar structures, there are slight differences in hardware and software requirements in different fields as well as different application modes [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref37\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref39\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></span>]. For example, the VR simulation training device for teaching mainly focuses on the use of a 3D or 360-degree environment and network resources, whereas simulations for surgery focus on the interaction between the operator’s instruments and the living anatomy. The environmental design simulations mainly consider the patient’s emotional control and feedback [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref40\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref42\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Here, 2D cognitive software and 3D practical VR software of BD MAX lessons were developed. MT interns can use this system to familiarize themselves with the use of virological testing equipment and assess their learning. The results showed that the use of the VR software met the students’ needs and enhanced their interest in learning. In addition, scores from written tests after VR training (posttraining) were significantly higher than after traditional demonstration teaching (posttraining) in the learning level. The behavioral assessment of students pre- and posttraining showed that students exposed to VR training had significantly improved virological knowledge.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Limitations</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The appropriateness of the selection of teaching scripts may have affected the breadth and validity of the use of the teaching software. The fidelity of the 3D elements’ object art and production during VR scenarios requires professional art experts and additional funding support. Due to the limited number of students, this study only has 1 arm and uses a pre- and postcomparison design. Future work will use a randomized 2-arm design to better understand the impact of the technology.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Conclusions</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first self-developed VR software for high-tech virological testing training. This valuable tool increased MT students’ learning effectiveness. This not only provides beginners and students with the opportunity to operate BD MAX but also saves laboratory and educational costs, thus, enhancing their learning motivation and practical skills. It can also reduce the risk of viral infections particularly during transmitted disease outbreaks. Although VR cannot replace real human interactions, it does have many advantages, such as the freedom to modify, move, and place objects in the virtual world. Its free access is not restricted by time, and it can reduce certain risks. Thus, VR is a valuable teaching tool.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-12\">Back pain has a high prevalence in today’s society and is one of the most common complaints in the population. In addition to frequency of occurrence, the main criteria for the assessment of back pain are severity, extent of functional impairment and prognosis with regards to return to functional and thus work capacity. Data on the prevalence of back pain in Germany include results from several regional and national surveys. The range of the prevalence lies between 30% and 70%, depending on the period considered (point prevalence, 7-day, 3-month and 1-year prevalence).<a id=\"xref-ref-1-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-1\">1</a> The lifetime prevalence for back pain in Germany ranges from 74% to 85%.<a id=\"xref-ref-2-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-2\">2</a> In terms of chronic back pain, the lifetime prevalence lies between 24% and 30%.<a id=\"xref-ref-3-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-3\">3</a> With regards to incapacity to work, there are various references in the literature.<a id=\"xref-ref-2-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-2\">2 4–6</a> Sixty eight per cent to 86% of patients with acute low back pain return to work within 1 month.<a id=\"xref-ref-4-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-4\">4</a> The recurrence rate of low back and neck pain is 47%–63%, the relapse rate into inability to work is 33%.<a id=\"xref-ref-1-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-1\">1 5 7</a> Relapse refers to the recurrence of back pain after temporary improvement. Musculoskeletal disorders are among the most expensive diseases in industrialised countries.<a id=\"xref-ref-8-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-8\">8</a> According to the 2008 Federal Health Report, the costs of non-specific low back pain amounted to €3.6 billion.<a id=\"xref-ref-2-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-2\">2 8</a> The majority of these costs are due to chronic low back pain and indirect costs resulting from the loss of patients’ ability to work. Wenig <em>et al</em> estimated the average total costs of back pain per patient to be €1322 per year.<a id=\"xref-ref-9-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-9\">9 10</a> As a cause of premature retirement due to reduced earning capacity, musculoskeletal disorders have taken second place in recent years after mental illness and behavioural disorders.<a id=\"xref-ref-2-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-2\">2 8</a> A large percentage of the elderly population suffers from one or more musculoskeletal disorders. However, chronic back pain, reported by about a quarter of women and 17% of men in Germany, often affects younger people in working life.<a id=\"xref-ref-11-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-11\">11</a>\n",
       "</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-13\">Back pain is usually treated in a monodisciplinary manner, although psychosocial risk factors in particular often hinder recovery and require a multimodal approach with close content-related therapy consultation.<a id=\"xref-ref-12-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12 13</a> Interdisciplinary multimodal treatment is not yet implemented in standard outpatient care.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-14\">Interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy (MPT) describes the simultaneous, comprehensive treatment in which various somatic, physical and psychological interventions are integrated according to a predefined treatment plan with an identified therapeutic goal. The treatment is provided in small groups with a maximum of eight patients by a team of therapists consisting of physicians, psychologists or psychotherapists and other disciplines such as physiotherapists and others.<a id=\"xref-ref-14-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-14\">14</a> MPT is currently considered the gold standard in pain management and treatment for patients with chronic or potentially chronic back pain.<a id=\"xref-ref-15-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-15\">15</a> The efficacy of interdisciplinary MPT in the treatment of chronic or recurrent back pain with risk of chronification has already been proven in various studies.<a id=\"xref-ref-8-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-8\">8 13 14 16–20</a> The term recurrent describes pain episodes that reoccur after a symptom-free period of at least 6 months.<a id=\"xref-ref-8-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-8\">8</a> Chronification, moreover, describes the transition from temporary to permanent, or chronic, back pain. After successful MPT, patients usually return to the monodisciplinary treatment of their general practitioner or orthopaedist. As a result, the risk of recurrence remains with the end of MPT. The goal of this new approach to the treatment of back pain is to achieve sustainability of MPT by combining MPT with relapse prophylaxis (RP). Thus, what is learnt during multimodal treatment in terms of physical activity and lifestyle can be applied to everyday life in the long term.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-15\">The intervention examined in this study, the 12-month RP programme, immediately follows the 4-week MPT. Like the MPT, the RP will be performed by the Rehabilitation Center, Bad Zwischenahn, on an outpatient basis. The rehabilitation centre is completely independent of the evaluating institution. The RP aims not only to provide prophylaxis against chronifying back pain relapses but also to support life-integrated physical activity. RP is the all-important link between the curative MPT phase beforehand and the patient’s physical activity afterwards. The patient will be assigned to one of three RP paths at the end of the MPT as part of an assessment during the interdisciplinary rounds and team meetings. The paths correspond to RP programmes with three different intensities (low, medium and high) for which the patient will be selected based on the severity of his or her complaints (see <a id=\"xref-fig-1-1\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F1\">figure 1</a>).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-16\" class=\"first-child\">Treatment algorithm.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-17\">The low intensity level will include the opportunity for telephone consultation and the maintaining of an exercise diary as well as an obligatory telephone conversation after 6 weeks. After 6 months and again after 1 year, a 3-hour training session will take place at the Rehabilitation Center with performance tests, examination of the exercise diary and therapeutically supervised training by physiotherapists and orthopaedists. In addition, a psychological group session will be conducted by psychologists.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-18\">The medium intensity level will additionally include a training session after 3 months and another obligatory phone call in the 4th week and 8th week after the MPT.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-19\">In the case of high-intensity RP, a weekly training session (12 weeks of 90 min each) under therapeutic supervision will be scheduled directly after the MPT. Sixteen weeks and 20 weeks post MPT, obligatory telephone calls with the patient will be conducted. The follow-up training course will be supplemented by another session after 9 months. For patients with a particularly high need for follow-up treatment, a 1-week training course will be offered after 12 months.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-20\">The RP offers the advantage of facilitating the patient’s transition into everyday life, accompanying and encouraging progress, as well as enabling early recognition and prevention of relapses. The further development of care thus consists of uninterrupted, seamless and long-term care of patients with back pain following MPT. Another goal is to motivate patients during both the MPT phase and the subsequent 12-month RP phase under multiprofessional guidance to adopt a lifelong active lifestyle. While developing good intentions seems easy, turning them into actions is a challenge. For many, the hurdles to a permanently active lifestyle in everyday life are high.<a id=\"xref-ref-21-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-21\">21</a> RP, therefore, serves primarily to provide professional support for the patient in the conscious, voluntary translation of goals and motives into results. For patients suffering from back pain, this can be regarded as a secondary prophylaxis against renewed pain, functional impairment and incapacity to work. In this respect, patients at risk of recurrent back pain are on the same level as patients with other chronic widespread diseases, such as diabetes or cardiovascular diseases, for which there has long been a consensus on appropriate prevention.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Multimodal pain therapy</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-21\">Employees of the AOK Lower Saxony will contact the potentially eligible insured and refer them to the Rehabilitation Center. Before starting MPT, a comprehensive initial examination will be performed by orthopaedists, physiotherapists and psychologists. The MPT programme intensity depends on the severity of the back pain. Patients in the standard MPT group will be treated for 3–4 hours per day, 4 days a week, while patients in the complex MPT will be treated for 5–7 hours per day, 5 days a week. Two groups of eight patients each will be conducted in parallel. The complex therapy group will provide additional treatment and place more emphasis on psychological and medical intervention aspects, while patients in the standard group will be advised to exercise on their own during these times. Overall, it is expected that patients will benefit from the structured approach of the programme.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-22\">Modules of the MPT programme will be medical lectures and seminars such as social medicine (eg, payment of wages in the event of illness and professional reintegration), information about the MPT concept and special features of MPT and RP, basic information in different lectures (eg, structure and function of the spine, muscles and health-disease conception: bio-psychosocial model) and seminars addressing common questions on topics such as obesity and back pain or correlations of symptoms with stress, sports, nutrition, medications, surgery, lifting and carrying. Another module will consist of medical consultations once a week, alternating between sessions with and without a physiotherapist or psychologist. In addition, regular medical consultations will take place for support in case of abnormalities in the course of the disease and for individual treatment (manual therapy, medication, etc), if needed. Moreover, psychological-pain therapy lectures and seminars will be carried out by psychologists. These will educate patients about pain and stress, mindfulness, problematic behaviour patterns and setting realistic goals. Psychological training sessions will provide practical implementations in form of relaxation techniques, stress management, progressive muscle relaxation and distraction from pain. In addition to individual psychological consultation, regular psychological counselling sessions will be offered. Finally, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, medical training therapy, sports therapy and a module on motivational and volitional aspects will complete the offer.</p>\n",
       "<h2 class=\"\">Aims</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-23\">The objective of the study is to evaluate the benefit of early and intensive relapse prevention in the context of MPT. The goal is to prevent the chronification of back pain and thus reduce the high direct and indirect costs. To answer this question, outcome, process and cost-effectiveness evaluations will be performed. The aim of outcome evaluation is to examine the intervention effect on patient-relevant outcomes. Process evaluation will examine the extent to which the intervention has been carried out and how the process is perceived and evaluated from the perspective of service providers and patients. Indirect and direct costs will be considered in the health economic evaluation.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-24\">From this, the following hypotheses can be derived:</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-25\">H<sub>1</sub>: the intervention reduces the days of incapacity to work (outcome evaluation).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-26\">H<sub>2</sub>: the intervention increases the functional capacity (outcome evaluation).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-27\">H<sub>3</sub>: the intervention is perceived positively by the participating patients (process evaluation).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-28\">H<sub>4</sub>: the intervention reduces direct and indirect costs (health economic evaluation).</p>\n",
       "<h2 class=\"\">Methods and analysis</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Study design</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-29\">In order to answer the research questions, outcome, process and health economic analyses will be carried out. Different research methods will be used for this purpose. The comparative population will be formed by randomising the groups of participants. The division into the respective groups (intervention group, IG or control group, CG) will be carried out monthly to ensure that the patients of both groups are not able to exchange information with each other. Patients who start an MPT simultaneously in the Rehabilitation Center each form a cluster. These clusters will be randomised to the IG or CG (see <a id=\"xref-fig-2-1\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F2\">figure 2</a>). The evaluator will inform the Rehabilitation Center monthly via email in the third week of the MPT whether the group is an IG or CG. Up to this point, neither the patient nor the treatment staff will know which group the patient belongs to. The recruitment period will be 24 months.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Outcome evaluation</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-31\">The results will be derived from a cluster-randomised controlled trial. The evaluation design incorporates an IG as well as a CG and surveys at three different points in time (see <a id=\"xref-fig-2-2\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F2\">figure 2</a>). Both groups will participate in the MPT programme. While IG members will additionally receive relapse prevention modules, the CG will undergo usual care. The primary outcome represents the number of days of incapacity to work within 1 year after the end of MPT. It is assumed that in the present sample, the average number of 37 days off work per year will decrease in the IG by 40% (or 15 days) compared with the CG. One secondary outcome addresses the functional capacity. It is assumed that the functional capacity in the IG will be significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher than in the CG. In addition, patient and provider satisfaction with the intervention will be explored, including barriers, hurdles and potentials. Direct and indirect costs are another outcome and will be compared between IG and CG.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Process evaluation</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-32\">To evaluate the process quality, we will examine the assignment of participants to the standard and the complex programme along with the distribution of the IG to low, medium and high intensity RP. In addition, we will consider usage of the modules (eg, medical training therapy, psychological support and phone consultation) as well as the app utilisation. To examine the quality of the intervention, patients will receive additional questions about their satisfaction with individual MPT and RP modules within the survey. In order to evaluate experiences and satisfaction with the intervention, guided interviews will be conducted. These will be carried out with all physicians, psychologists and physiotherapists involved.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Health economic analysis</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-33\">The health economic analysis will examine the costs, cost savings and cost effectiveness of the intervention. Therefore, intervention costs, expenditures of healthcare utilisation, indirect costs due to incapacity to work and the patient’s health-related quality of life will be assessed. For the calculation of indirect costs, the days of incapacity to work are multiplied by the average hourly wage in Germany, taking into account whether the individuals work full time or part time. The evaluation will be carried out based on claims data. Incremental cost effectiveness will be analysed by considering direct and indirect costs as well as the health-related quality of life of both groups, IG and CG.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Measurements</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-34\">Various instruments will be used in the course of primary data collection, including standardised questionnaires (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-1\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>). Prior to the start of MPT, the IG and CG will receive a questionnaire to assess the status quo at the beginning of the intervention (T0). The questionnaire will be handed out directly at the Rehabilitation Center or sent by mail in individual cases for T0 and after the 4-week MPT programme (T1). It will comprise various items on socio-demographic and socioeconomic parameters together with health-related behaviour (exercise, diet, smoking, etc). Health-related questionnaires will be the Heaviness of Smoking Index,<a id=\"xref-ref-22-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-22\">22</a> the AUDIT alcohol consumption questionnaire, an effective brief screening test for problem drinking<a id=\"xref-ref-23-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-23\">23</a> and the Pain Disability Index.<a id=\"xref-ref-24-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-24\">24</a> In addition, the questionnaire will include items about how often and to what extent the study participants exercise,<a id=\"xref-ref-25-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-25\">25</a> as well as questions about diet and nutrition.<a id=\"xref-ref-26-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-26\">26</a> In addition, standardised survey instruments will be included to assess functional capacity (Questionnaire for the diagnosis of functional disability caused by backache, FFbH-R)<a id=\"xref-ref-27-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-27\">27</a> and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D).<a id=\"xref-ref-28-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28</a> A Visual Analogue Scale will be used to assess the patient’s health-related quality of life from 0 to 100. IG and CG will receive further questionnaires 12 months post intervention (T2). All questionnaires except for T0 will include questions regarding patient satisfaction and experience with the intervention. Two weeks after handing out or sending the questionnaire, patients who have not yet responded will receive a reminder to increase the response rate. A second reminder will be sent after an additional 10 days. Reminders and the final questionnaires (T2) for the IG will be sent by the Rehabilitation Center, while those for the CG will be sent by the health insurance fund.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-35\" class=\"first-child\">Quantitative and qualitative data sources</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-36\">Secondary data will be included in the analyses based on claims data of the regional health insurance fund AOK Lower Saxony. These will include inpatient treatment, rehabilitation services, pharmaceuticals and remedies along with days of incapacity to work. Moreover, sociodemographic factors of influence (eg, age, gender and level of education) together with data regarding health-related quality of life will be included in the analysis.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Study population</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-37\">The study population will comprise members of the regional health insurance fund AOK Lower Saxony, residing in the northwest of Lower Saxony (see <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-1\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental figure S1</a>). The specific inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in <a id=\"xref-table-wrap-2-1\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T2\">table 2</a>.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Participant recruitment</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-44\">Each month, with the exception of December, two MPT courses with eight participants each can be held at the Rehabilitation Center, Bad Zwischenahn. In December, a single course will be held. Over a recruitment period of 24 months, a maximum of 368 individuals could begin an MPT. Potentially eligible individuals will be identified and contacted through health insurance employees. If they are interested, they will be informed and invited to participate in the programme. A diagnostic day will then be arranged at the Rehabilitation Center (see <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-3\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental figure S1</a>), where the medical criteria will be reviewed once again.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-45\">The risk factors of a possibly low willingness to participate or a high dropout rate of patients were counteracted in advance by the close involvement of the specialised employees of the AOK. For example, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed based on their experience. Nevertheless, the development of the case number and the dropout rate will be subject to constant monitoring so that actions can be taken and incentives implemented if necessary.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Sample size calculation</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-46\">The case number calculation was carried out for the primary outcome days of incapacity to work. Currently, the described patient group of AOK-insured persons has an average number of 37 days off work (SD: 58) per year. It is assumed that the average number of 37 days off work per year will decrease in the IG by 40% (or 15 days) compared with the CG. This results in an effect size of d=0.3409275. To test with a power of 80% (1−ß=0.8) and a significance level of 5% (ɑ error=0.05), a case number of 137 subjects per group is required for significant proof of the expected effect. The number of cases was calculated using the software G*Power (see <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-4\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental figureS2</a>).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-47\">Taking an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.01 and a design effect of 1.1 at an average cluster size of 15.3 (22×16+2×8) into account, the required number of cases is 293 subjects, that is, 147 subjects per group.<a id=\"xref-ref-29-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-29\">29–32</a> Considering a drop-out of 10% for patients who drop out during the MPT, that is, before randomisation, results in a required total case number of 322. The available population covers the required case number (see <a id=\"xref-fig-3-1\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F3\">figure 3</a> and <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-2-1\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC2\">online supplemental figure S2</a>).</p>\n",

       "<h3>Qualitative analysis</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-51\">The qualitative guided interviews will be documented by means of audio recordings. The recordings will be transcribed without personal information (eg, name and place of residence).

The applied treatments within the intervention and the potential health problems that may occur are known. Possible adverse events include, for example, pain intensification, pain relapse, muscle strain and other side effects that can occur with any physical activity and specific exercises. The practitioners are prepared and educated for possible adverse events. Experienced practitioners will immediately recognise when adverse events occur during the treatment.

       "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n",
       "<p>Cerebral autoregulation or the ability to maintain a constant blood flow to the brain during conditions of changing systemic blood pressure is common knowledge since decades [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>]. In the clinical setting, both cerebral hyperperfusion and hypoperfusion can have detrimental effects [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>]. Absence of cerebral autoregulation was reported to be associated with adverse outcomes in critical care patients [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>]. Recently, cerebral autoregulation measurements have been introduced in the perioperative setting, usually based on near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as a surrogate parameter for cerebral blood flow [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>]. These measurements are based on the assumption that on the so-called Lassen’s curve, cerebral blood flow is kept constant over a broad range of mean arterial blood pressure, while above and below this steady-state, cerebral blood flow follows blood pressure changes passively [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. However, the validity of this model and therefore its applicability in a clinical context is still unclear [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. Therefore, currently there is no reference method to determine the status of cerebral autoregulation. The aim of the Limits Of Cerebral AutoRegulation (LOCAR) pilot study was to provide an experimental model for cerebral hypoperfusion and hyperperfusion in five healthy volunteers using incremental lower body negative pressure (LBNP) until presyncope and lower body positive pressure (LBPP) combined with mild hypoxia. Thus, it was the objective to produce a state of impaired cerebral autoregulation, below the lower autoregulation limit with LBNP and above the upper autoregulation limit with LBPP and hypoxia [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. We intended to investigate whether impaired autoregulation is represented by transcranial doppler (TCD) or NIRS-derived autoregulation indices and how this is reflected by global hemodynamic parameters. We hypothesized that autoregulation indices adequately represent impaired autoregulation when exceeding or undercutting the autoregulation thresholds in presyncope and in increased preload and/or increased cardiac output during hypoxia. We further intended to examine the agreement between NIRS and TCD-based autoregulation measurements.</p>\n",
       "<h2>Materials and methods</h2>\n",
       "<p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the North Rhine Chamber of Physicians (No 2018246). 5 healthy, male volunteers between age 22 and 30 (mean 24.4 ± 2.6 years) were recruited. Mean Height of the subjects was 182.8 ± 3.4 cm, weight 84.8 ± 6.7 kg, BMI 25.4 ± 1.7. Individual biometric data of subjects are shown in <a href=\"#pone.0287578.s001\">S1 Table</a>. None of the subjects had a history of arterial hypertension or antihypertensive medication. After obtaining written informed consent, all subjects underwent standardized medical screening. Although the LBPP experiment was performed before LBNP, the order of presentation is reversed here for reasons of better readability. We did not randomize the protocol since incremental LBNP was applied until presyncope requiring recovery.</p>\n",
       "<h3>LBNP experiment</h3>\n",
       "<p>Subjects were placed on the experimental table in a supine position and received peripheral venous cannulation. Monitoring was attached consisting of ECG, peripheral oxygen saturation, continuous blood pressure, stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) monitoring via fingercuff (Finapres NOVA, Finapres Medical Systems, Enschede, Netherlands), cerebral Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS, NIRO 200NX, Hamamatsu Photonics, Herrsching, Germany), and right temporal transcranial doppler sonography (TCD) via robotic probe (Delica 9UA, Shenzen Medical, Shenzen, China). Their analog output signals were synchronously recorded at 500 Hz by using an analog-digital-converter and then stored on a laptop using the Windaq data acquisition software (Dataq Instruments, Akron, OH, USA). A custom-made airtight chamber was fastened above the lower body of the subject. A Neoprene skirt attached to the chamber and fastened around the waist of the subject prevented air from leaking into the pressure chamber. The lower body chamber was connected to a calibrated air pump that produced a preset pressure which it adjusted automatically according to pressure feedback from a sensor installed inside the chamber. Once all signals were stable, a 10-minute baseline measurement was initiated. Subsequently, lower body pressure was decreased to -15 mmHg for a time of 5 minutes. Pressure was then reduced to -30 mmHg for another 5 minutes. LBNP was further decreased in -5 mmHg steps every 5 minutes. The maximum pressure was maintained until subjects experienced symptoms of presyncope indicated by dizziness, nausea and a sudden loss of blood pressure or cardiac output. At presyncope, LBNP was immediately turned off and the subject was tilted into Trendelenburg position.</p>\n",
       "<h3>LBPP experiment and hypoxia</h3>\n",
       "<p>For the experiment with positive pressure and hypoxia, subjects were placed on the experimental table as mentioned above. Monitoring was identical to the LBNP experiment. Additionally, subjects received a face mask for in- and expiratory O<sub>2</sub> and etCO<sub>2</sub> measurements which were acquired with an Innocor gas analyzer (Innovision, Glamsbjerg, Denmark). Once stable signals were achieved on all channels, a baseline measurement of 10 minutes was started. LBPP was then increased in 5 mmHg steps every 5 minutes until the last pressure stage where steady LBPP could be maintained (20 or 25 mmHg), then hypoxia was established with LBPP maintained. Hypoxia was achieved with a gas blender attached to pressurized air and pressurized nitrogen. The gas mixture accumulated in a reservoir bag was subsequently inhaled by the subjects. Hypoxia was reached with an SpO<sub>2</sub> of 84%. The experiment was continued for 10 minutes or until abort by the subject. Termination of the experiment was done by turning of the LBPP and detaching the face mask.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Data acquisition and—analysis</h3>\n",
       "<p>Data acquisition for subsequent off-line beat-to beat analysis was performed with the Windaq system at a sample rate of 500 Hz (Dataq Instruments, Akron, USA). QRS complexes from the ECG, heart rate, systolic-, mean-, and diastolic finger blood pressure were automatically detected and marked based on a custom-written software (“Physiowave”) in PV-Wave language (PV-Wave, Visual Numerics, Boulder, USA). Data were manually checked by an experienced observer for wrong or missing values. Further data processing was performed with Matlab (Matlab R2020a, MathWorks Inc. Natick, USA). Cerebral autoregulation indices were calculated using a version of the moving average (Mx) algorithm [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]: A moving Pearson correlation coefficient between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and middle cerebral artery mean flow velocity (MFV, Mx) or MAP and cerebral tissue oxygenation index (TOI, ORx) over 30 ten second averages was used to indicate the state of autoregulation. The resulting Mx and ORx indices are dimensionless values between 0 and 1 representing the degree of linear relationship between MAP and MFV or MAP and TOI, respectively. Increased indices reflect a more pressure passive nature of the underlying TCD or NIRS values. A Pearson coefficient of 0.3 and above was interpreted as disturbed autoregulation for Mx and ORx based on previous reports [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>]. Values for cerebral and global hemodynamic variables as well as autoregulation parameters at the first 10 seconds of the last pressure level in LBNP, 5 seconds before and after presyncope as well as at the last pressure level in LBPP and during hypoxia were compared to baseline measurements (mean values over 10 minutes).</p>\n",
       "<h3>Statistics</h3>\n",
       "<p>Statistical calculations were performed with SigmaStat 14.0 (Systat Software, San Jose, USA) Comparisons between parameters at baseline, the last pressure level on LBNP/LBPP, and presyncope/hypoxia were done using the One Way Repeated Measured Analysis of Variance (RM ANOVA). A Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test for normal distribution of parameters. Post-hoc-t-tests for multiple pairwise comparisons were performed. P values were automatically corrected for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni correction. Mx and ORx were compared using linear regression analysis. P-values of &lt;0.05 were considered significant.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Discussion</h2>\n",
       "<p>In this study on five healthy male young adults, we could show that both Mx and ORx represent impaired cerebral autoregulation in LBNP, but show little agreement throughout the LBNP and LBPP experiment. LBPP and hypoxia do not appear to result in impaired cerebral autoregulation.</p>\n",
       "<h3>LBNP and the limits of cerebral hypoperfusion</h3>\n",
       "<p>The results presented here show that cerebral hypoperfusion begins at a reduction of 35% in MFV of the middle cerebral artery as measured by TCD and a reduction of 5.6% in cerebral tissue oxygen saturation as measured by NIRS. This is in contrast to current accepted limits of the respective methods. A higher volatility of MFV in comparison to cerebral saturation has been described previously on several occasions [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. Currently, widely accepted thresholds for a reduction in cerebral saturation is a decrease of more than 20% or below 50% absolute value and for TCD a reduction of more than 50% in MFV [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>]. It has to be noted that differences in cerebral saturation between NIRS devices from different manufacturers exist [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. Although these thresholds are mostly based on patients during general anesthesia, there is data on awake patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, reporting cutoff values of 48% reduction in MFV and 20% reduction in NIRS for development of cerebral ischemia [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. While one still has to consider the differences to our healthy subjects and the difference in outcome, we suggest a reevaluation of critical limits of both NIRS and TCD. Our results also highlight that in our patients, hypoxia had a larger effect on cerebral saturation than had hypoperfusion, again pointing out that several factors contribute to cerebral oxygen saturation.</p>\n",
       "<p>In our subjects, both MAP and CO parameters such as SV appear to be involved in the development of cerebral hypoperfusion. While SV was significantly decreased at the last LBNP level this was not reflected by CO. In both MAP and CO, a significant reduction only occurred with presyncope which also reflects cerebral parameters. We interpret this as active regulation mechanisms which compensate decreasing SV before the onset of presyncope which is marked by a decrease in CO which also translates to cerebral parameters. Neumann et al. reported a dependence of cerebral blood flow on CO rather than MAP in hypertensive patients during LBNP [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]. A combined MAP and CO dependence of carotid blood flow has also been shown by Skytioti et al. in surgical patients [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. The same group have demonstrated an association between CO and carotid blood flow in healthy subjects undergoing LBNP, while MAP remained practically unchanged. Skytioti’s LBNP experiment consisted of intermittent LBNP stages of -30 mmHg in contrast to incremental LBNP in our setup that led to presyncope making the results difficult to compare [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>While the exact threshold for impaired autoregulation remains unclear and is reported to be at index values of 0.3 to 0.5, a threshold of 0.3 has mostly been used recently [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. Using this threshold, both Mx and ORx adequately represent impairment in autoregulation during presyncope. However, while there was a large increase in ORx, the difference in Mx compared to baseline was less distinct, since Mx was already elevated above 0.3 at baseline. One has to keep in mind the different measurement modalities of TCD and NIRS, the one representing exclusively arterial flow while the other is a mostly venous signal [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. Although the meaning of an impaired TCD-derived autoregulation at baseline is unclear at this point, we have to assume that this is a physiological phenomenon in our cohort of healthy subjects. Therefore, these results question the ability of the Mx to discriminate between intact and impaired autoregulation in contrast to the ORx. The use of a higher Mx threshold of 0.5 would not have changed this finding [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>]. One may suspect from these results that TCD-derived indices are more sensitive, as we have also suspected previously in a clinical context [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. Our findings may also confirm the hypothesis that the plateau region on the autoregulation curve is not as wide as previously assumed and may be missed by some measurement modalities, or alternatively may not be present at all [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. At the beginning of the last pressure level at which presyncope occurred we did not observe significant changes in Mx or ORx, while both were below the 0.3 threshold. It seems that cerebral autoregulation was still intact at this point even with imminent presyncope. We suspect that in our collective of young healthy subjects, regulatory mechanisms may be active until the final collapse of hemodynamics in presyncope which is only then reflected by increased Mx and ORx. We also suspect differences to older, morbid patients or patients during general anesthesia. However, more data is needed to investigate the relationship between autoregulation indices, age and medical history.</p>\n",
       "<h3>LBPP/hypoxia</h3>\n",
       "<p>While LBNP has been studied extensively, the same does not apply to LBPP. We observed a decrease in MFV while TOI remained unchanged at the last pressure level of LBPP. CO and SV decreased while there was a substantial increase in MAP. These hemodynamic findings are in line with previous head-down tilt studies representing the same physiological mechanism [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>]. Perry et al. reported unchanged cardiac output, but increased MCA flow velocity in moderate LBPP of 20 mmHg, but unchanged MFV in high LBPP of 40 mmHg which is explained by alterations in baroreflex sensitivity [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>]. Despite lower LBPP levels in our subjects, our findings are still in line with Perry et al, although we would explain the decrease in MFV rather mechanistically with the higher postcapillary resistance once a level of stressed volume of the venous system is reached. Mx and ORx calculations did not indicate impaired autoregulation during LBPP, nor was this the case for hypoxia, despite a significant increase in MAP and increased CO during hypoxia. This is somewhat surprising since impaired autoregulation has been reported to occur in acute hypoxia on several occasions [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>]. Whether the hypoxia stimulus was insufficient to cause impaired autoregulation or indices did not adequately show impaired autoregulation is unclear. TCD values appeared unaffected by LBPP or hypoxia which may indicate cerebral hemodynamic changes in hypoxia were not sufficient to cause autoregulation impairment. However, hypoxia acts as a powerful vasodilatator which has been shown to alter TCD readings [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>]. Hypocapnia may also play a role through hyperventilation [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>]. TOI naturally showed a substantial decrease during hypoxia. This is important for clinical practice since changes in oxygen saturation may be more pronounced in NIRS than changes in cerebral circulation. In NIRS, cerebral malperfusion may thus be masked by changes in oxygen settings. Therefore, with the results presented here we cannot confirm the use of Mx or ORx for the determination of the upper autoregulation limit. For future studies we suggest different methods to reach the upper autoregulation limit, such as exhaustive exercise or a combination of exercise and LBPP [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>].</p>\n",
       "<h3>Agreement between autoregulation indices</h3>\n",
       "<p>Both Mx and ORx represent autoregulation impairment in presyncope using a threshold of 0.3 to 0.5, although the impairment is more distinct in ORx. As shown in <a href=\"#pone-0287578-g003\">Fig 3</a>, Mx and ORx show poor agreement throughout the LBNP and LBPP experiment, excluding hypoxia. It appears that Lassen’s curve and its relationship to global hemodynamic parameters depends on the location and modality of measurement. What can be stated at this point is that Mx and ORx are not interchangeable and measurements from different modalities may only be compared with caution. This is in contrast to a report by Steiner et al. on intensive care patients with sepsis, where an almost perfect agreement between the two methods has been shown [<a href=\"#pone.0287578.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>]. The difference in our findings may be caused by awake subjects with spontaneous breathing unlike Steiner’s patients or the underlying disease which may be associated in compromised regulation mechanisms of the cerebral vasculature. Cortical activation in awake subjects may further influence results, while cortical activity should remain relatively unchanged in sedated patients. While the exact cause of this disparity remains unclear at this point, it can be stated that Mx and ORx methods yield different results in awake subjects. However, further validation studies are necessary to confirm these results.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Limitations</h3>\n",
       "<p>Several limitations are associated with this study. First, this is a pilot study with few subjects, therefore it is difficult to generalize the presented results. Second, NIRS and TCD both represent surrogate parameters for cerebral blood flow which both have inherent technical limitations affecting measurement precision and accuracy such as an unknown vascular diameter and dependence on the insonification angle in TCD and for NIRS the possibility of extracranial contamination of the signal. The same is the case for non-invasive CO and MAP measurements which may present inaccuracies, especially in the more extreme ranges.</p>\n",
       "<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n",
       "<p>In summary, in our pilot study on healthy male subjects we could show that while NIRS and TCD-derived autoregulation indices Mx and ORx both indicated presyncope in LBNP, they showed poor agreement throughout the LBNP and LBPP experiment. During presyncope, changes in Mx were less distinct than in ORx. Thus, our results support the use of ORx to indicate impaired autoregulation while the same remains questionable with Mx. During LBPP alone or in the combination with hypoxia the upper limit of cerebral autoregulation could not be observed with Mx or ORx in our subjects. We suggest that other methods be used to reach the upper limit of autoregulation. In awake subjects, direct comparisons between Mx and ORx should only be done with care. These results should be confirmed in a larger study.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n",
       "<p>Economic crises, wars, natural disasters, and increased inequalities between countries have generated significant migration waves. Over the past decade, the migrant population has increased by 23% in countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>] and by 28% in the European Union [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. These movements, involving large proportions of young adults, women in particular [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>], result in increasing the proportion of births to foreign-born women in their host countries. In Europe, every fourth birth is to a foreign-born mother, although this rate varies substantially across countries [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. This trend presents organizational and cost challenges for the host health systems, especially as migrant women appear to be more vulnerable and to have greater social and health needs than native-born women [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>Because the scientific literature on the association between migration and severe maternal outcomes is heterogeneous and inconclusive, it cannot accurately inform public policies or healthcare provision [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. Some studies in high-income countries have reported higher risks of maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity among migrant women than native-born women [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>–<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>], while others have not [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>–<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. Whether this heterogeneity is related to differences in definitions and methods of measuring migration and maternal outcomes or to real differences between settings remains unclear. Studies have defined migrant women according to their race or ethnicity [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>–<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>], nationality [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>–<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>], or their birthplace [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>–<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>]. A few others have used other criteria, such as the Human Development Index of the country of origin [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>], length of residency in the host country, or legal status [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>]. The Reproductive Outcomes and Migration (ROAM) collaboration and the EURO-PERISTAT project recommended that maternal country of birth be used to study immigrants’ perinatal health [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>]. The severe maternal outcomes targeted and their definitions also vary greatly across studies. Moreover, because much of the available literature is based on routinely collected data coded by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), severe maternal outcomes might well be misclassified [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>–<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>]. A previous review and meta-analysis of data from Western European countries between 1970 and 2013 showed that migrant women have a risk of maternal mortality twice that of women born in the host country [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. Its results were nonetheless limited by the important heterogeneity in the definitions of migrant women across studies and the inclusion of old data. Another systematic review also conducted on European studies compared the risk of nonsevere maternal outcomes between 2007 and 2017 for specific subgroups of migrant women only—asylum seekers and undocumented migrant women in Europe. It reported that the risk of maternal mortality and all-cause severe maternal morbidity was higher among asylum seekers than native-born women [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>Applying a single definition of migrant women, in accordance with international recommendations, we aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of available information about the risk of severe maternal outcomes among migrant and native-born women in high-income countries.

       "<p>We searched Medline via PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library without language restriction.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included in the first selection by titles and abstracts to allow backward snowballing but excluded in the second selection. Case–control and case studies were excluded. The exclusion of studies before 1990 aimed to limit the heterogeneity in migrant women’s characteristics and host countries’ integration policies that could be caused by too long a study period.</p>\n",
       "<p>Our review included studies that defined migrant women as women born outside the host country and compared them with women born in the host country, in accordance with international recommendations [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref045\" class=\"ref-tip\">45</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref046\" class=\"ref-tip\">46</a>]. The severe maternal outcomes studied were maternal mortality, all-cause severe maternal morbidity, and cause-specific severe maternal morbidity, during pregnancy and up to 1 year after delivery. The specific causes of severe maternal morbidity included were severe postpartum hemorrhage, eclampsia, severe sepsis, and uterine rupture, as well as maternal intensive care unit (ICU) admission and near misses, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref047\" class=\"ref-tip\">47</a>]. This review did not consider maternal mental health outcomes because we believe they require a specific assessment and because a systematic review on this topic was registered as underway when we started (PROSPERO, CRD42021226291) and finally published [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref048\" class=\"ref-tip\">48</a>].</p>\n",

Those subgroups were defined according to the host country (European countries, the United States of America (USA), Canada, and Australia), the migrant women’s regions of birth (Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Asia and the Pacific), the migrant women’s legal status (migrant women with host country nationality, legally resident migrant women without host country nationality, and undocumented migrant women), and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale score.

Because 4 studies yielded several reports covering different outcomes or different subgroups of migrant women, we included 39 reports overall. The median year of publication was 2017 (range 2008 to 2022). Half the studies used the ICD or procedure codes to define their outcomes (Tables <a href=\"#pmed-1004257-t001\">1</a> and <a href=\"#pmed.1004257.s005\">S5</a>). The assessment of the quality of the studies included is presented in the appendix (<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.s006\">S6 Table</a>). According to the Newcastle–Ottawa scale score, only 1 study had a low methodological quality that limited the relevance of the subgroup analysis (Tables <a href=\"#pmed-1004257-t001\">1</a> and <a href=\"#pmed.1004257.s006\">S6</a>).

Some subgroups of migrant women were at higher risk of maternal mortality than their native-born counterparts.

Among European countries, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Norway, and Spain presented a particular pattern, with no significant excess risk of maternal mortality for migrant women considered globally (<a href=\"#pmed-1004257-g002\">Fig 2</a>), but specific subgroups studied according to their region of birth did show such an excess risk compared to native-born women (<a href=\"#pmed-1004257-g003\">Fig 3</a>).</p>\n",

       "<p>A funnel plot was performed only for maternal mortality, as it was the only outcome for which a sufficient number of studies was available. It suggests a small-study effect (<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.s012\">S5 Fig</a>), which may be partly explained by the heterogeneity across host countries (<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.s013\">S6 Fig</a>).</p>\n",
       "<h2>Discussion</h2>\n",
       "<p>In high-income countries, the differential risk of severe maternal outcomes between migrant and native-born women, defined as women born outside and in the host country, varied by both host country and the migrant women’s region of birth. Migrant women in European host countries were at higher risk of severe maternal outcomes than native-born women, while migrant women in the USA and Australia did not differ from those born there for such outcomes. Migrant women born in sub-Saharan Africa, in Latin America and the Caribbean, or in Asia were at higher risk of severe maternal outcomes than the women born in their host countries, but those born in Europe or in the Middle East and North Africa were not.</p>\n",
       "<p>Our systematic review shows that migrant women living in European host countries had a higher risk of severe maternal outcomes than the native-born women, while migrant women in the USA and Australia did not. The social structure of the native-born groups is a hypothesis that might explain this disparity between these high-income settings. In the USA and Australia, the groups with the highest maternal mortality and morbidity rates are, respectively, Black [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref075\" class=\"ref-tip\">75</a>] and indigenous [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref060\" class=\"ref-tip\">60</a>–<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref063\" class=\"ref-tip\">63</a>] women, both included in the native-born reference group. The maternal mortality ratio is from 3 to 6 times higher in Black than in White women in the USA [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref076\" class=\"ref-tip\">76</a>] and in indigenous versus nonindigenous women in Australia [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref060\" class=\"ref-tip\">60</a>–<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref063\" class=\"ref-tip\">63</a>]. Furthermore, the overall maternal mortality ratio in the USA is more than twice as high as in Europe, and this ratio for native-born US White women is double that for native-born Europeans [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref053\" class=\"ref-tip\">53</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref055\" class=\"ref-tip\">55</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref076\" class=\"ref-tip\">76</a>]. In both the USA and Australia, therefore, the subgroups at risk of severe maternal complications appear to be related more to race or ethnicity than to migrant women’s region of birth. Thus, in these contexts, the comparison between “native” and “foreign-born” populations does not take into account the colonial history and migratory backgrounds of the now “native” populations that played a role in determining these groups’ social position and their health status.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another interesting finding is that migrant women born in sub-Saharan Africa, in Latin America and the Caribbean, and in Asia were at higher risk of severe maternal outcomes than the corresponding native-born women of the host country, although migrant women born in Europe or in the Middle East and North Africa were not. Notably, the particular pattern observed in the UK, with no significant excess risk in migrant women versus native-born women globally, when we did not consider region of birth, highlights the importance of studying migration according to this factor. One hypothesis for this differential risk among subgroups of migrant women is that the specific migration contexts and paths of these subgroups do not carry the same risks. Migrant women born in sub-Saharan Africa, in Latin America and the Caribbean, and in Asia have usually lived in the host country for less time and are more frequently disadvantaged by a language barrier, lack of legal status, social isolation, and poor housing conditions, compared with other categories of migrant women [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>]. These cofactors may result in a more difficult access to healthcare system, especially prenatal care, which is known to be inadequate more often, in both quantity and quality, among these geographical subgroups [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref077\" class=\"ref-tip\">77</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref078\" class=\"ref-tip\">78</a>]. Researchers have explored the association between severe maternal outcomes and other categorizations of migrant women’s native countries, besides geography. One study using the World Bank classification of economies found a higher risk of maternal near misses in migrant women from low-income countries and not in those from middle- or high-income countries, compared with women born in Sweden [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref072\" class=\"ref-tip\">72</a>]. A Spanish study used the Human Development Index of countries to report that maternal death rates were higher for migrant women from countries with the lowest Human Development Index [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref058\" class=\"ref-tip\">58</a>]. We could not include these analyses in our review since each was unique in its categorization. These approaches, however, provide interesting insights into the causal mechanisms of health disparities among migrant women.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another explanatory hypothesis for the differential risk we found according to the migrant women’s region of birth is the possibility of discrimination against some subgroups of migrant women with physical (e.g., black skin) or cultural singularities that might activate bias among healthcare professionals and lead to differential care [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref079\" class=\"ref-tip\">79</a>–<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref081\" class=\"ref-tip\">81</a>]. These discriminations may originate from individual attitudes through explicit or implicit bias but could also be driven by structural racism [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref082\" class=\"ref-tip\">82</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref083\" class=\"ref-tip\">83</a>]. An approach that focuses on the migration issue and takes the fact of being born abroad as the only exposure variable cannot by itself provide an insight into the mechanisms of social inequalities in health between migrant and native-born women. This approach is necessary and, in our opinion, justifies the studies thus far conducted in this way and included in this systematic review. It cannot, however, be sufficient. Maternal health is influenced by the complex interaction of multiple social factors. Among these factors, socioeconomic determinants, such as migrant women’s administrative status, should be considered and analyzed as potential intermediate factors. Race/ethnicity, a major determinant in contexts such as the USA or Australia, even when migration is the main focus of the studies, should also be collected and included in the analysis to enable multidimensional descriptions of the groups being compared and provide deeper insight to the causal relationships with health outcomes.</p>\n",
       "<p>To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on the association of migrant women and native-born women in high-income countries with various severe maternal outcomes and according to a single and consensual definition of migrant women. In contrast to previous systematic reviews, we have included all data available from high-income countries and not only those in Europe [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>]. This offers the opportunity to compare national contexts with various migration demographic patterns, as well as various public policies related to migration. Use of this single, consensual definition makes it possible to address migration issues specifically, separate from overall ethnic or racial disparities, although the ethnic/racial dimension is probably one of the mechanism involved in the disparities faced by migrant women [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref045\" class=\"ref-tip\">45</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref046\" class=\"ref-tip\">46</a>]. It also reduced the heterogeneity between studies and improved their comparability. This important heterogeneity in the definitions of migrant women across studies was the main limitation of a previous review and meta-analysis [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. This definition of migrant women, as being born outside the host country, is the one used by the International Organization for Migration [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref084\" class=\"ref-tip\">84</a>] and recommended by the Reproductive Outcomes and Migration collaboration and the EURO-PERISTAT project, to study migrants’ perinatal health [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>]. We were able to apply this definition for all included studies except for some Dutch studies [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref065\" class=\"ref-tip\">65</a>,<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref066\" class=\"ref-tip\">66</a>] where we cannot exclude that some second-generation migrant women were included in the migrant women group. This definition offers the advantage of targeting a homogeneous group of first-generation migrants. Second-generation migrant women constitute a specific group interesting to study, but databases with available data on the parents’ and grandparents’ countries of birth are still too rare for a synthesis of their results to be useful. Our planned subgroup analyses enabled us to explain a part of the still substantial heterogeneity between studies. In order to explore between-study heterogeneity, we decided to perform subgroup analyses instead of meta-regression with host country and region of birth as moderators because these characteristics are closely related in the set of studies we found, resulting in collinearity in the model, likely to bias the estimates. As a consequence, we cannot totally rule out that host country and region of birth actually characterized the same subgroups of migrant women. Nevertheless, our analysis was still limited by the persistent heterogeneity in definitions of all-cause and cause-specific severe maternal morbidity. Moreover, our review may be limited by the questionable validity of administrative databases because of the uncertain quality of the reporting and the intrinsic limitations of ICD codes—both sources of potential misclassification [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>]. Another limitation is that we could not take into account other social factors that may interact with migration to determine maternal health, because many of these data are unavailable. The paucity of studies with data on migrant women’s legal status prevented a subgroup analysis of this variable. Finally, we cannot exclude the risk of selective outcome reporting bias within studies. Researchers may report their findings selectively by choosing to focus on selected outcomes and analyses based on the results [<a href=\"#pmed.1004257.ref051\" class=\"ref-tip\">51</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>Our findings provide valuable insights for further exploration of the causal mechanisms of maternal health inequalities by highlighting those faced by migrant women in high-income countries according to both their region of origin and the host country. Our analysis was still limited by the persistent heterogeneity in definitions of all-cause and cause-specific severe maternal morbidity. Thus, future studies should use harmonized definitions for all-cause and cause-specific severe maternal morbidity, and future investigations should examine the extent to which specific hypothesized mechanisms, related to the characteristics of the women or the healthcare system, explain the association between migrants and severe maternal outcomes in different settings. Approaches combining the joint characterization and analysis of severe maternal outcomes according to ethnicity, race, and migration could shed light on these question and help to guide policies and care.</p>\n",
       "<p>To conclude, the differential risk of severe maternal outcomes between migrant women and native-born women in high-income countries varies by the host country and the migrant woman’s region of birth. Our findings highlight the maternal health inequalities faced by migrant women in high-income countries according to their region of origin and host country. Future studies should use harmonized definitions for all-cause and cause-specific severe maternal morbidity and be designed to explore in greater depth the mechanisms of inequalities between migrant women and native-born women.</p>\n",

       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">In November 2022, OpenAI publicly launched its large language model (LLM), ChatGPT, and reached the milestone of having over 100 million users in only 2 months. LLMs have been shown to be useful in a myriad of health care–related tasks and processes. In this paper, I argue that attention to, public access to, and debate about LLMs have initiated a wave of products and services using generative artificial intelligence (AI), which had previously found it hard to attract physicians.

       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"The-ChatGPT-Revolution\" data-label=\"The-ChatGPT-Revolution\">The ChatGPT Revolution</h3>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">In November 2022, OpenAI publicly launched its large language model (LLM), ChatGPT [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></span>]. It reached the milestone of having over 100 million users in only 2 months. In comparison, reaching the same milestone took TikTok and Instagram 9 months and more than 2 years, respectively. In March 2023, OpenAI had already released a new iteration called GPT-4 that was claimed to be 100 times better than the previous version.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">LLMs have seen rapid advancements and practical applications in various industries from marketing and information technology to publishing and even health care [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">These models can generate human-like text, assist in diagnosing conditions based on medical records, and even suggest treatment options or plans. Given the potential implications for patient outcomes and public health, as well as the impact on the jobs of medical professionals, LLMs have attracted much attention.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">LLMs have been shown to be used in a myriad health care–related tasks and processes. Examples include education and research [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref3\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></span>], analyzing electronic health records [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref4\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></span>], oncology [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref5\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></span>], cardiology [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref6\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></span>], writing discharge summaries [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref7\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></span>], and medical journalism [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref8\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></span>]. The number of use cases has skyrocketed, as well as the challenges and issues around the use of this particular technology. The ethics of its use have been analyzed in depth [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref9\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></span>]: LLMs have been hallucinating references; their role as a potential coauthor of research papers has been debated; it has been shown that such models can pose a cybersecurity threat [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref10\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></span>]; and they can be biased [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref11\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Nevertheless, in this paper, I argue that attention to, public access to, and debate about LLMs have initiated a wave of products and services using generative artificial intelligence (AI), which had previously found it hard to attract physicians.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">There are events of a certain magnitude that can lead to significant changes in a field, especially regarding the attitude of people experiencing them. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented level of patients and physicians adopting technologies such as remote care and at-home laboratory testing [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref12\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></span>]. Advances in cloud computing led to new discoveries and developments in AI in the 2010s. The release of LLMs can mark a similarly impactful event that leads to physicians gaining first-hand experience with AI-based tools and technologies.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">No matter how many studies, clinical trials, regulatory approvals, and product announcements keep on becoming available about AI’s role in medicine and health care, adoption rates have been lagging behind [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref13\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref14\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></span>]. One of the reasons for this has been limited access to AI technologies. There have been hundreds of AI applications with regulatory approval; however, they were only available in limited health care institutions to a select group of physicians [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref15\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">This paper describes what AI tools have become available since the beginning of the ChatGPT revolution and contemplates how they might change physicians’ perceptions of this breakthrough technology.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"The-Swarm-of-Generative-AI-Tools\" data-label=\"The-Swarm-of-Generative-AI-Tools\">The Swarm of Generative AI Tools</h3>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">In principle, tasks in a physician’s job that are repetitive in their nature and are data-based are prone to being automated. Most of the AI-based medical technologies that have received regulatory approval are built on this idea and address one specific task, mostly in radiology, cardiology, and oncology.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Generative AI has brought this to a new level. Generative AI refers to a category of AI models that are capable of generating new data samples by learning the underlying patterns and structures of a given data set. These models, including generative adversarial networks (GANs) and generative pretrained transformer (GPT)-like architectures, have demonstrated prowess in a wide range of applications, including image synthesis, natural language processing, and drug discovery. As generative AI continues to advance, it holds the potential to revolutionize industries by enabling the creation of novel and customizable content, accelerating research, and expanding the scope of human creativity.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Since the end of 2022, basic AI tools and services using generative AI have become widely accessible. This might mark the beginning of AI becoming used in practice for the average medical professional.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Even health care companies have started to integrate LLMs into their services. Examples include Microsoft’s Nuance bringing ChatGPT into its medical note-taking tool; Nabla (Nabla SRL) using ChatGPT to have conversations with patients; and Epic introducing LLMs to their electronic health record software [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref16\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref18\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Examples-of-AI-Tools-for-Physicians\" data-label=\"Examples-of-AI-Tools-for-Physicians\">Examples of AI Tools for Physicians</h3>\n",
       "<h4>Building a Website With AI</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">There are AI-based website builders that can create a brand-new website in a few minutes. Users can choose between design themes and a number of functionalities. Some of the companies even offer more advanced frameworks, such as web shops and responsive sites that automatically adjust to the device—mobile or computer—the visitor uses [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref19\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The output currently is not as versatile or customized as a site built by a team of professionals, and these services have limitations with search engine optimization, but a physician building a website for their practice in minutes is still an impressive feat.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Creating Videos With AI</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">LLMs are capable of coming up with ideas for video content and even writing the scripts (eg, with prompts such as “write a 5-minute script about the importance of the flu shot for the elderly”). Revoicer (Revoicer Ltd), a text-to-speech algorithm, can transform the script into audio content, and tools like Yepic (Yepic AI Ltd) and Synthesia (Synthesia Ltd) can generate a video featuring a synthetic human. While synthetic voices and humans do not reflect the original, these tools still allow users to create informative video content without having a content production team at hand for a fraction of the cost of hiring all these professionals [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref20\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<h4>Designing Presentations With AI</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Creating presentations for meetings and conferences can be cumbersome even if clinicians are experienced with presentation tools like PowerPoint (Microsoft Corp) or Prezi (Prezi Inc). There are AI presentation tools that design stylish presentations from primary inputs. Physicians can choose a template and input basic data, information, and facts, and AI will do the rest by formatting the slides and offering visuals, animations, or voice-overs. The results can be somewhat generic—but in most cases are still more attractive than what most physicians could make by themselves [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref21\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<h4>AI as a Medical Scribe</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A growing number of algorithms claim to record and transcribe meetings or conversations automatically, analyze the content, and provide an easy-to-understand, searchable report. Some of these solutions are specifically designed for medical use, while others target a more general audience. Companies targeting health care users offer complex services, such as AI transcribing a consultation that is then reviewed by a human professional for accuracy. Clear limitations are that general transcription tools might pose a risk when used in medical settings, while those specifically designed for medical uses tend to be on the expensive side. However, using such tools might relieve burdens on medical professionals and reduce excessive administrative tasks, which are a major cause of physician burnout [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref22\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<h4>Creating Social Media Posts, Frequently Asked Questions, and Other Informational Content for Patients With AI</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Generative AI, especially LLMs and AI image generators such as DALL-E (OpenAI) and MidJourney (MidJourney Inc), can be used to provide written and image-based content for patients. ChatGPT can assist physicians in crafting social media posts, general informational materials, and brochures aimed at educating patients. While physicians need to verify every detail these generated posts contain, using AI can still save considerable time in the process.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Designing Logos and Images</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">AI image generators like DALL-E and MidJourney can generate images based on text prompts. Such images can be used as logos for medical practices, visualizations for social media posts, and to help deliver messages on websites.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Medical Research and Literature Analysis</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Tools like Semantic Scholar (Allen Institute for AI) use AI to help physicians stay up-to-date with the latest research findings by analyzing and summarizing relevant articles, making it easier to keep abreast of medical advancements.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The difference between these and the previously regulated AI-based medical technologies is that the tools described above are widely accessible, do not require any prior technical training, and are not dedicated to niche areas such as specific medical specialties.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"The-Impact-of-Generative-AI-on-the-Accessibility-of-AI-for-Medical-Professionals\" data-label=\"The-Impact-of-Generative-AI-on-the-Accessibility-of-AI-for-Medical-Professionals\">The Impact of Generative AI on the Accessibility of AI for Medical Professionals</h3>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Using AI was previously possible in research groups dedicated to this technology, in health care settings where certain tools were available, and for selected individuals who were fortunate enough to receive access to them. The widespread release of LLMs and other AI tools using generative AI has increased accessibility for medical professionals to test this breakthrough technology. It has also come with additional benefits.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Democratization of AI Technology</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Open-source projects and accessible platforms have allowed developers and researchers to contribute to AI advancements, fostering a community-driven approach that has enhanced the growth and reach of AI tools in the medical field. AutoGPT represents one of the most popular directions [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref23\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<h4>Cost-Effectiveness</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The affordability of AI solutions has enabled medical professionals to adopt these tools in their practice without incurring prohibitive costs. This has been essential in bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and its practical application in health care settings.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Improved Data Processing and Analysis</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">LLMs excel at handling vast amounts of unstructured data, such as clinical notes and medical literature, which has facilitated the extraction of valuable insights and improved decision-making processes for medical professionals.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Enhanced Communication and Collaboration</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">AI-powered tools can streamline communication between health care providers, patients, and interdisciplinary teams, promoting a more collaborative environment and fostering better patient outcomes.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Continuous Learning and Adaptation</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">LLMs have the capacity to learn from new data and adapt to the evolving needs of medical professionals, thus offering more effective and targeted solutions in real time. Physicians can ask ChatGPT to provide summaries, explanations, and key points from recent medical literature and can present hypothetical patient cases or real anonymized cases and seek guidance on differential diagnoses, treatment options, and potential risks, further enhancing their clinical decision-making abilities. Physicians can even request ChatGPT to generate quiz questions or self-assessment exercises on specific medical topics to test their knowledge and identify areas for improvement.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Generative-AI-Raises-More-Questions-Than-We-Can-Answer\" data-label=\"Generative-AI-Raises-More-Questions-Than-We-Can-Answer\">Generative AI Raises More Questions Than We Can Answer</h3>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">While it is simple to see the benefits of a generation of medical professionals obtaining real-life experience with a technology like AI, the journey ahead raises more questions than we can answer now. Here, I summarize those questions with the highest importance.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">There are strict regulations on the way AI technologies designed for a medical or health care–related purpose can access patient and medical databases, but there are none for generative AI tools made for a general audience without any medical purpose. If physicians use such tools, they are left alone with no guidance about how to deal with patient privacy or legal responsibilities.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Moreover, as LLMs tend to generate not only responses but also the resources they base their responses on, physicians need to verify every detail that comes from using generative AI.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Currently, no clinical guideline is available on their use and how to implement them in medical practice.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">There is an ongoing debate about who owns copyright on AI outputs, such as text or images. If a physician uses an AI image generator to create a new logo for their website, in theory, anyone can use the same logo unless the user pays for the exclusive rights. The same issue stands for text made by generative AI for physicians to use in their research papers, as well as the presentations and videos created with these tools. There have been attempts from legal experts to provide solutions for this challenge, but there is no consensus yet [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref24\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">As AI has finally become a tool for the masses, and it has become increasingly hard for physicians to ignore its use whether it is for medical, research or personal purposes, properly preparing medical professionals for its advantages and risks has become a timely challenge of crucial importance. Medical curricula, guidelines of medical associations, and the general discussion about AI’s future role in our profession must adjust accordingly.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Medical curricula could involve teaching prompt engineering to provide knowledge, skills, and a mindset for medical professionals to become proficient users of generative AI. Medical associations should provide a path forward for using such AI tools in the practice of medicine while keeping the values of evidence-based medicine and the importance of patient design in mind. And even more importantly, policymakers today face the challenge of not only designing policies and regulations for the generative AI tools medical professionals can use today, but also for the next versions and iterations that might involve analyzing other types of data, from image and video to sound and documents.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">This is certainly an unprecedented challenge that requires relatively quick turnaround from all decision-makers in health care.</p>\n",

Objective To summarise current international guideline recommendations for hand hygiene in community settings and to assess to what extent they are consistent and evidence based. Eligibility criteria We included international guidelines with one or more recommendations on hand hygiene in community settings—categorised as domestic[comma] public or institutional—published by international organisations[comma] in English or French[comma] between 1 January 1990 and 15 November 2021. Data sources To identify relevant guidelines[comma] we searched the WHO Institutional Repository for Information Sharing Database[comma] Google[comma] websites of international organisations[comma] and contacted expert organisations and individuals. Charting methods Recommendations were mapped to four areas related to hand hygiene: (1) effective hand hygiene; (2) minimum requirements; (3) behaviour change and (4) government measures. Recommendations were assessed for consistency[comma] concordance and whether supported by evidence. Results We identified 51 guidelines containing 923 recommendations published between 1999 and 2021 by multilateral agencies and international non-governmental organisations. Handwashing with soap is consistently recommended as the preferred method for hand hygiene across all community settings. Most guidelines specifically recommend handwashing with plain soap and running water for at least 20 s; single-use paper towels for hand drying; and alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) as a complement or alternative to handwashing. There are inconsistent and discordant recommendations for water quality for handwashing[comma] affordable and effective alternatives to soap and ABHR[comma] and the design of handwashing stations. There are gaps in recommendations on soap and water quantity[comma] behaviour change approaches and government measures required for effective hand hygiene. Less than 10% of recommendations are supported by any cited evidence. Conclusion While current international guidelines consistently recommend handwashing with soap across community settings[comma] there remain gaps in recommendations where clear evidence-based guidance might support more effective policy and investment.

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY The scoping review follows the Arksey and O’Malley methodological framework to identify[comma] retrieve and summarise current international guideline recommendations for hand hygiene in community settings. Various sources were systematically searched to identify relevant guidelines published by multilateral agencies and international non-governmental organisations between January 1990 and November 2021. The search was limited to guidelines published in English or French and therefore may have excluded relevant guidelines published in other languages. The quality of the included guidelines was not assessed[comma] although we did consider the extent to which recommendations were based on cited evidence. Introduction Hand hygiene[comma] including handwashing with soap and other methods such as alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHRs)[comma] is an important public health measure that can prevent the transmission of a range of diseases.1 Handwashing with soap has been found to be a cost-effective intervention2 that can reduce the risk of both diarrhoeal disease and acute respiratory infections by over 20%.3–9 Handwashing with soap has also been linked to the reduction of certain neglected tropical diseases[comma] including trachoma and some soil-transmitted helminth infections.10 11 Recently[comma] handwashing with soap and the use of ABHRs were advised as one of the key control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic12 13 and were found to be effective.14 This scoping review focuses on hand hygiene in non-healthcare settings[comma] which we collectively refer to as ‘community settings’. Using the definition set out in the Ottawa Charter[comma] we consider settings as where ‘health is created and lived by people within the settings of their everyday life; where they learn[comma] work[comma] play and love’[comma]15 and include domestic[comma] public and institutional settings. The practice of hand hygiene—and access to the facilities which enable this—is often limited in these community settings[comma] particularly in low/middle-income countries.16 In the domestic setting[comma] 30% of the global population does not have access to a basic handwashing facility with soap and water at home[comma]17 18 with three-quarters of those living in low-income countries.17 In institutional settings[comma] an estimated 43% of schools worldwide do not have access to basic hand hygiene facilities[comma]18 but there are limited data for other institutional settings[comma] such as the workplace and prisons and places of detention[comma] and public settings[comma] such as markets[comma] transportation hubs[comma] and places of worship.18 Despite the international recognition of hand hygiene as a critical public health measure[comma] a recent global assessment of government policies[comma] planning and financing for hygiene found that while the majority of surveyed countries reported having national policies for hand hygiene[comma] less than 10% had sufficient financing to implement them.19 Various international guidelines with recommendations on hand hygiene for non-healthcare settings exist[comma]13 20–22 but it is unclear whether current international guidelines are comprehensive[comma] consistent and based on the most rigorous evidence available. This review aims to summarise current international recommendations for hand hygiene in community settings[comma] identify areas of consistency and concordance[comma] and assess whether recommendations are evidence based. Methods This review follows the six stages of the Arksey and O’Malley methodological framework for scoping reviews.23–25 Expert consultation (stage 6) was integrated throughout the scoping review process24 to obtain feedback on the scope and conceptual framework and to identify any additional guidelines beyond those identified during the electronic search. Our review is described according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR)26 and a PRISMA-ScR checklist is included in the online supplemental table A1. The protocol was preregistered with OSF Registries.27 Supplemental material Identifying the research question (stage 1) To identify and refine the research question[comma] a conceptual framework was developed for this review and built around three key concepts: (1) hand hygiene[comma] (2) non-healthcare settings and (3) current international guidelines (figure 1). In this review[comma] we define hand hygiene as any action of hand cleansing for the purpose of removing or deactivating pathogens from hands.28 Effective hand hygiene is defined as any practice which removes or deactivates pathogens from hands and thereby limits disease transmission.28 Conceptual framework for hand hygiene in community settings. The first key concept in the conceptual framework—hand hygiene—covers four areas: effective hand hygiene[comma] minimum requirements[comma] behaviour change and government measures (figure 1). Effective hand hygiene refers to definitions and practices. Minimum requirements refer to the materials[comma] services and infrastructure required for effective hand hygiene. Behaviour change denotes the appropriate behavioural performances that promote and sustain effective hand hygiene. Government measures concern actions taken by governments to ensure effective hand hygiene[comma] which are categorised according to an established framework29 as follows: policy and strategy; institutional arrangements; sector financing; planning[comma] monitoring and review; capacity development; and equity. The second key concept—community settings—is defined as settings where healthcare is not routinely delivered[comma]28 broadly spanning all places where people ‘learn[comma] play[comma] work and love’15 and specifically including domestic[comma] public and institutional settings. As these settings may not exclusively refer to physical settings[comma]30 the review also includes recommendations for vulnerable populations (eg[comma] people experiencing homelessness) who may reside permanently or semipermanently in public spaces. Nursing homes[comma] long-term care facilities[comma] non-acute care facilities and home care are also included in the review under institutional settings[comma] as the boundary between healthcare and non-healthcare settings is often unclear or recommendations for these subsettings may not be disaggregated[comma] especially in the context of COVID-19 where people received care at home. The third concept—guideline—is defined as a published document where the primary purpose is to provide specific guidance[comma] in the form of recommendations[comma] towards a course of action. A recommendation is defined as a statement designed to assist a targeted actor to make an informed decision on whether[comma] when and how to undertake a specific action.31 Our review is limited to international guidelines to identify generalisable recommendations of global relevance. Identifying relevant studies (stage 2) To identify relevant guidelines[comma] the search strategy consisted of the following sources: (1) the WHO Institutional Repository for Information Sharing (IRIS) Database[comma] (2) Google search engine[comma] (3) websites of international organisations known to work on hand hygiene (online supplemental file 1) and (4) contacting experts. We searched the WHO IRIS Database using prespecified search terms related to hand hygiene[comma] non-healthcare settings and guidelines (online supplemental table A3). The search in Google was carried out using the anonymous function in the web browser (Chrome) to reduce the influence of the reviewer’s (CM) individual search history. Search strings were constructed by using multiple combinations of search terms from online supplemental table A3. The first 10 pages of Google were reviewed by one reviewer (CM). Documents that at first appeared related to the research question and met the inclusion criteria were included for further screening. Expert consultations were conducted with ‘Hand Hygiene for All’ Initiative core partners (online supplemental table A4) to identify potentially relevant guidelines. The reference lists of guidelines were also hand-searched for any additional relevant documents. The search was limited to English and French languages and publication date was restricted to 1 January 1990 onwards to identify current guidelines. Study selection (stage 3) Documents meeting the following criteria were included: (1) international guideline[comma] (2) offers one or more recommendations on hand hygiene[comma] (3) targets at least one community setting[comma] as defined in the conceptual framework[comma] (4) published by an international non-governmental organisation (NGO)[comma] multilateral agency or public health agency[comma] (5) published in English or French[comma] and (6) published between 1 January 1990 and 15 November 2021. The review excludes guidelines for humanitarian settings[comma] as internationally agreed guidance on hand hygiene in humanitarian settings and complex emergencies is available through the Sphere standards for water[comma] sanitation and hygiene (WASH) promotion.32 Only the most recent versions of guidelines were included[comma] with previous versions of the same guidelines excluded. Country-specific guidelines were also excluded. All documents retrieved from electronic searches and expert consultations were transferred to Mendeley33 for de-duplication. Inclusion was completed in two stages: (1) title and abstracts were screened for eligibility by one reviewer (CM); and (2) full texts of all potentially eligible documents were retrieved and independently assessed for inclusion by two reviewers (CM and LB). Disagreement between reviewers on inclusion was resolved through arbitration by a third reviewer (OC). Charting the data (stage 4) Guideline characteristics and recommendations from included guidelines were double-extracted by two reviewers (CM and LB) using a standardised data extraction template in MS Excel34 and then cross-checked for accuracy. As with inclusion[comma] a third reviewer (OC) provided arbitration if agreement on extraction could not be reached. The data extraction form (online supplemental table A5) included information on guideline characteristics[comma] such as author[comma] year of publication[comma] target setting and COVID-19 response[comma] as well as 57 specific parameters related to the four areas of hand hygiene described in the conceptual framework (figure 1). Recommendations for each parameter were extracted from included guidelines where possible. Collating[comma] summarising and reporting the results (stage 5) Guideline recommendations were first summarised for each parameter across community settings and then disaggregated by domestic[comma] public or institutional setting where relevant. Definitions and recommendations for hand hygiene were assessed for consistency[comma] concordance and whether supported by cited evidence. Recommendations were classified as consistent[comma] fairly consistent or inconsistent if they featured in 10 or more[comma] 4–9 or less than 4 guidelines[comma] respectively. Concordance is here defined as parameters with no consistent or fairly consistent recommendations at odds with each other. We also used a hierarchical system to classify evidence cited for recommendations into five levels[comma] adapted according to an established classification system35: (1) systematic review or meta-analysis[comma] (2) randomised controlled trial or controlled trial without randomisation (eg[comma] quasi-experimental)[comma] (3) guideline (either developed from systematic reviews or not developed from systematic reviews)[comma] (4) observational study (eg[comma] cohort[comma] cross-sectional[comma] case–control studies)[comma] and (5) expert opinion or anecdotal information (eg[comma] programme documentation). A recommendation was considered evidence based if the guideline provided a specific citation for the recommendation[comma] which was coded according to the level of evidence cited. Finally[comma] evidence gaps were defined as parameters with very few recommendations (ie[comma] less than 10 recommendations[comma] equivalent to less than 20% of guidelines providing a recommendation). Patient and public involvement There was no public or patient involvement in the course of this project. Results Search results Electronic searches were conducted on 15 November 2021[comma] identifying 3360 records (2432 from the WHO IRIS Database[comma] 900 from Google[comma] 28 from international agency websites) (online supplemental table A2) and a further 11 records identified through expert consultation. Following de-duplication[comma] a total of 3132 records were screened by title and abstract[comma] and 125 documents were sought for retrieval for full-text screening[comma] with one document not accessible. Finally[comma] 51 guidelines are included in the review (figure 2). The 73 documents excluded during the full-text review are listed in the online supplemental table A6 with reasons for exclusion. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram. Description of included guidelines The 51 included guidelines were published in English between 1999 and 2021[comma] with 38 published in 2020 or later and 31 providing guidance specifically on hand hygiene to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19. Among the 51 included guidelines[comma] 67% are published by multilateral agencies (WHO[comma] UNICEF[comma] United Nations High Comissioner for Refugees and International Labour Organization)[comma] 23% by international NGOs[comma] and 10% by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (online supplemental table A7). Most guidelines target public and institutional settings[comma] while none exclusively target the domestic setting. More specifically[comma] 43% (n=22) target the public setting[comma] 43% (n=22) the institutional setting[comma] 4% (n=2) the domestic and public setting[comma] and 10% (n=5) more than one setting (eg[comma] domestic[comma] public and/or institutional). Of the 22 guidelines for the public setting[comma] 20 concern public spaces and 2 concern vulnerable populations within public spaces (eg[comma] people experiencing unsheltered homelessness and people living in dense[comma] informal settlements). For institutional settings[comma] eight guidelines concern schools[comma] six the workplace[comma] four prisons and places of detention[comma] three places of worship[comma] and one long-term care facilities and home care. Almost no guidelines[comma] however[comma] define a community setting. The majority of recommendations are generalisable to high-income[comma] medium-income and low-income settings. Overall[comma] we extracted 923 recommendations from the 51 included guidelines (online supplemental table A8). Recommendations for effective hand hygiene Hand hygiene definitions Only 10% of guidelines provide a clear definition for hand hygiene or safe or effective hand hygiene.36–40 Meanwhile[comma] 75% of guidelines provide at least one recommendation on when to practise hand hygiene[comma] referred to in our review as a ‘key moment’. Guidelines use inconsistent terms for defining when to practise hand hygiene[comma] such as ‘key times’ (14%)[comma]37 41–46 ‘critical times’ (8%)47–50 and ‘key moments’ (4%).21 51 Otherwise[comma] guidelines either do not use a specific term for defining a key moment (49%) or do not recommend at least one key moment (25%). Hand hygiene practices There is agreement among guidelines on what constitutes effective hand hygiene across community settings[comma] although there are gaps in recommendations on how to practise effective hand hygiene. Almost all guidelines (90%) recommend washing hands with soap and for the duration of at least 20 s (27%) (table 1). In addition[comma] 63% of guidelines recommend the use of ABHR as an alternative or complement to handwashing with soap[comma] though very few guidelines recommend duration for hand rubbing. There is a lack of recommendations on handwashing or hand rubbing technique (16%)[comma]21 40–42 47 52–54 with two of these guidelines (25%[comma] n=2)21 40 referring to the WHO instructions for hand hygiene in healthcare settings.28 Meanwhile[comma] 24% of guidelines recommend the inclusion or provision of simple instructions on handwashing technique in hygiene promotion programmes[comma] yet none of these guidelines include specific steps on handwashing or hand rubbing technique. Consistent and fairly consistent recommendations for hand hygiene in community settings Guidelines provide inconsistent recommendations on when to practise hand hygiene. Over 30 different individual key moments are recommended among the guidelines. Despite this inconsistency[comma] the individual key moments most commonly mentioned include ‘before and after eating’[comma] ‘after using the toilet’[comma] ‘before and after preparing food’[comma] ‘after blowing nose[comma] coughing or sneezing’[comma] and ‘after touching public surfaces or objects’ (table 1). The latter two feature most commonly among guidelines published during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fairly consistently recommended individual key moments include ‘when entering or exiting the home or public space’[comma] ‘after changing a child’s diaper’ and ‘when hands are visibly dirty’. Almost all guidelines recommend clusters of key moments (ie[comma] individual key moments recommended together). The most common ones are ‘after using the toilet’ with ‘before and after eating’ (39%[comma] n=20); ‘after using the toilet’ with ‘before and after preparing food’ (24%[comma] n=12); and ‘after using the toilet’ with ‘before and after eating’[comma] and ‘after blowing nose[comma] coughing or sneezing’ (22%[comma] n=11). Recommendations for minimum requirements Handwashing materials Guidelines consistently recommend plain soap for handwashing across all community settings and paper towels or electric dryers for hand drying in public and institutional settings. Most guidelines (65%) do not recommend a specific type of soap for handwashing[comma] though some specifically recommend bar soap (24%)[comma] liquid soap (22%) or ‘soapy water’ (eg[comma] home-made mixture of powder or liquid soap[comma] or bar soap shavings diluted in water) (16%) (table 1). No guidelines specifically recommend antibacterial soap. For hand drying after handwashing[comma] most guidelines recommend clean[comma] single-use paper towels (39%) and electric air-drying systems (22%) in public and institutional settings. Eight per cent of guidelines recommend a bin with disposal liners and lid for the waste management of paper towels in public and institutional settings.21 55–57 No guidelines provide a recommendation for hand drying materials in the domestic setting. Soap and water requirements for handwashing While guidelines consistently recommend running water for handwashing with soap[comma] there are gaps for soap and water quantity and discordant recommendations on water quality for handwashing. For water services[comma] almost half (43%) of guidelines recommend running water[comma] 16% a piped water system connected to a tap[comma] and 14% water trucking[comma] storage or manual refilling. Few guidelines recommend a minimum quantity of liquid or bar soap (14%)43 48 58–61 or water (18%)12 20 47 50 60–62 required for handwashing (eg[comma] minimum amount of water needed to wet hands or soap product necessary to cover all surfaces of hands for handwashing with soap) (table 2). One guideline[comma] for example[comma] recommends less than 5 mL of liquid soap per person per handwashing event[comma]60 whereas three other guidelines recommend at least 250 g of bar soap per person per month for handwashing.43 48 61 For water quality[comma] 16% of guidelines state that water must be of drinking water quality[comma] in line with WHO guidelines.21 40 41 52 54 63–66 In contrast[comma] 8% state that it does not have to be of drinking water quality[comma]12 20 39 67 though none specify a quantitative standard nor whether non-drinking quality water may conditionally be used if high-quality water is not available. In addition[comma] 10% of guidelines recommend that free residual chlorine must be greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/L after at least 30 min of contact time.43 48 63 68 69 Parameters with gaps in recommendations (ie[comma] fewer than 10 recommendations[comma] equivalent to less than 20% of guidelines providing a recommendation) Alternative materials for hand hygiene There are consistent recommendations for ABHR as an alternative material for hand hygiene. Of the guidelines that recommend ABHR[comma] 35% (n=18) recommend ABHR with at least 60% alcohol[comma] 22% (n=11) do not specify an alcohol percentage and only 6% (n=3) recommend an alcohol percentage of at least 70%. In addition[comma] 18% of guidelines recommend ABHR where soap and water are not available37–39 41 42 52–54 70 and 10% (n=5) only if hands are not visibly soiled.21 36 40 65 71 There are discordant recommendations for the use of ash. Twenty-two per cent of guidelines recommend ash as an alternative material to soap for handwashing.12 36 43 45 47 52 64 65 71–73 In addition[comma] 14% recommend ash if ABHR or soap is not available.12 43 45 47 52 64 73 However[comma] 6% (n=3) of guidelines advise against the use of ash or other products[comma] such as soil[comma] sand[comma] mud or water alone.45 47 62 In addition[comma] while some guidelines (8%) recommend 0.05% chlorine solution[comma]48 53 54 63 one guideline advises against it.13 When disaggregated by setting[comma] ABHR is most consistently recommended in public and institutional settings where it may meet larger and more frequent demand than handwashing stations. Similarly[comma] recommendations for the conditional use of ABHR where soap and water are not available feature the most in the institutional setting[comma] particularly in the workplace and schools. Ash is most commonly recommended in the public setting[comma] which includes low-resource and water-scarce settings where soap and water may not be available. Hand hygiene stations Overall[comma] there are inconsistent recommendations on hand hygiene facilities and their location[comma] as well as gaps. Across all settings[comma] guidelines recommend washbasins (eg[comma] ceramic[comma] cement or plastic) (16%)[comma] a bucket or container connected to tap (14%) and tippy taps (12%) for handwashing stations (table 1). Guidelines specify 16 different locations for handwashing stations[comma] which include by the entrance and exit of public spaces and buildings (eg[comma] restaurants[comma] shops[comma] markets[comma] places of worship[comma] train and bus stations) (27%)[comma] in close proximity to toilets (27%)[comma] and next to food preparation and eating areas (18%). Guidelines also mention placing hand hygiene stations[comma] such as ABHR dispensers[comma] at key entry and exit points of public spaces and buildings (14%). There are inconsistent recommendations on the optimal spacing and number of users per handwashing station[comma] whereas none for ABHR dispensers. Gaps in recommendations include those for hand hygiene materials and product supply chains[comma] cost and affordability[comma] functionality[comma] durability[comma] and hand hygiene station operation and maintenance responsibilities and actions (table 2). Recommendations on the location of handwashing stations vary slightly by setting. Close proximity to toilets is consistently recommended for both public and institutional settings (10% and 14%[comma] respectively). By the entrance and exit of public spaces is most consistently recommended for public settings (24%). Next to food preparation and eating areas is most consistently recommended for institutional settings (12%)[comma] such as schools and the workplace. Hand hygiene station access and adaptations Guidelines recommend hand hygiene stations that are accessible for all and adapted for pandemic response. For example[comma] 10% of guidelines recommend that the height of soap and water taps be appropriate for access by children[comma] the elderly and disabled (eg[comma] 500–700 mm basin height for children and 850 mm basin height for wheelchair access) (table 1). Forty-five per cent (n=23) of guidelines recommend COVID-19-related adaptations for hand hygiene stations[comma] such as taps that limit cross-contamination (16%)[comma] 1–2 m spacing between stations (12%)[comma] regular tap disinfection (10%)[comma] and towels for opening and closing taps (8%). Other adaptations include theft resistance (eg[comma] attaching soap or other movable pieces to the station) (16%) and water-saving designs (eg[comma] low-flow faucets) (12%). Recommendations for behaviour change Overall[comma] there are few recommendations related to hand hygiene behaviour change[comma] though there are consistent recommendations on behaviour change messaging and delivery channels. For behaviour change messaging[comma] some guidelines (10%) recommend messages that target ‘motives’74 (table 1).20 45 54 64 71 In terms of delivery channels[comma] 31% of guidelines recommend using visual reminders (eg[comma] signs[comma] posters or leaflets) and 24% mass communication (eg[comma] radio[comma] social media or mobile phone text messaging) to deliver behaviour change messages. Prompts[comma] cues and habit formation are fairly consistently recommended as behaviour change techniques.20 39 52 67 71 75–78 Formative research for behaviour change programmes is recommended by 10% (n=5) of guidelines[comma]46 47 49 72 76 though only 8% (n=4) specifically mention undertaking formative research to identify behavioural determinants among the target population.46 47 49 72 Guidelines provide inconsistent recommendations on behaviour change approaches (18%)[comma] determinants of hand hygiene to target for interventions (22%)[comma] and behaviour change models or frameworks (33%). Lastly[comma] there are gaps in recommendations on frequency of behaviour change interventions (ie[comma] how often an intervention should be delivered) and behaviour change approaches (4%)20 46 (table 2). Recommendations for government measures Overall[comma] few guidelines (22%[comma] n=11) provide a recommendation on government measures. Nonetheless[comma] recommendations for sector policy and strategy include promoting local soap production and fostering public–private partnerships for handwashing (4%).47 49 For institutional arrangements[comma] 4% of guidelines suggest identifying ways of cross-sectoral collaboration for hand hygiene[comma]20 49 while other recommendations centre on engaging communities[comma] the private sector and civil society for the delivery of WASH services.12 65 On planning[comma] monitoring and review[comma] 4% of guidelines recommend supporting or reinforcing existing monitoring systems or creating a government-led national monitoring system[comma] in line with global hygiene indicators.49 68 Evidence-based recommendations Of the 923 recommendations extracted from the 51 included guidelines[comma] most (93%) do not have a citation for one of the five levels of evidence identified for the review (ie[comma] systematic review[comma] randomised and quasi-randomised trial[comma] guideline[comma] observational study or anecdotal information) (figure 3). Of the remaining 7% of recommendations[comma] less than 1% cite evidence from a systematic review.46 In addition[comma] less than 1% cite evidence from a randomised or quasi-randomised trial[comma]12 36 while over 1% cite evidence from observational studies[comma] which are mainly recommendations for alternative hand hygiene materials[comma] such as ash[comma] sand and soil[comma] or alternative water sources for handwashing[comma] such as cooking or laundry water[comma] bathwater and seawater.12 36 47 Less than 1% of recommendations cite other guidelines developed from systematic reviews[comma]21 47 67 70 while 2.5% cite other guidelines not developed from systematic reviews[comma]51 56 57 65 71 78 79 such as WHO interim guidelines for hand hygiene in the context of COVID-19.51 56 57 65 71 78 79 The other 2% of recommendations cite anecdotal information[comma] such as programme documentation.45 47 62 76 Percentage of recommendations cited by one of the five types of evidence or no evidence. Discussion We identified 51 guidelines published between 1999 and 2021 by various international agencies covering a range of community settings. Most guidelines target the public and institutional settings[comma] while surprisingly none exclusively target the domestic setting. Overall[comma] community settings are not clearly defined among the guidelines[comma] which presents an opportunity for future normative guidelines to establish a clear and common definition[comma] especially as it relates to hand hygiene. Overall[comma] no guidelines comprehensively address hand hygiene across domestic[comma] public and institutional settings[comma] and very few recommendations are evidence based[comma] highlighting a gap in global normative guidance on hand hygiene in community settings. Effective hand hygiene There is agreement among guidelines on what constitutes effective hand hygiene; however[comma] inconsistencies and gaps remain as to when and how to practise hand hygiene. Current recommendations for handwashing with soap reflect findings from published literature[comma] which show that handwashing with soap is an effective means for preventing the transmission of a range of diseases.3–9 Regarding when to practise hand hygiene[comma] future guidelines could focus key moments on those most likely to interrupt the transmission of infectious diseases in domestic[comma] public and institutional settings. These might include ‘after using the toilet’ to reduce the transmission of diarrhoea-causing pathogens[comma]9 and ‘after touching high-contact surfaces’ or ‘after coughing or sneezing’ to reduce the risk of respiratory infections.3 Lastly[comma] gaps in recommendations on handwashing and hand rubbing technique present an opportunity for future guidelines to recommend the optimal technique for reducing bacterial load on hands. Minimum requirements Consistent recommendations for the use of soap and water and ABHR suggest the widespread acceptability of these materials for effective hand hygiene across community settings. Current recommendations for the use of plain soap are consistent with findings from a systematic review that suggest that plain soap is more effective than antibacterial soap at removing or inactivating pathogens on hands in community settings.80 Recommendations for running water are equally relevant as unreliable water supply negatively affects households’ ability to perform hand hygiene.81 Gaps in recommendations on minimum quantities of soap and water required for effective hand hygiene are also important for future guidelines to address. The recommended use of ABHR with at least 60% alcohol is in line with several studies which have found that ABHRs with an alcohol concentration between 60% and 80% are more effective at killing germs than those with a lower alcohol percentage[comma] particularly in clinical settings.82 83 Although ABHR can still inactivate many types of microbes when used correctly[comma] evidence suggests that soap and running water are still more effective at removing certain types of pathogens that may be present on hands.1 The WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care[comma] for example[comma] recommend ABHR as the preferred method for routine hand hygiene in healthcare settings when hands are not visibly soiled[comma] as it enables more frequent hand hygiene.28 Similarly[comma] in community settings[comma] ABHR may be suitable in contexts where frequent hand hygiene is necessary[comma] such as transport hubs and entrances or exits to public spaces and buildings.84 ABHR may also be favourable where frequent hand hygiene is required[comma] as the repeated use of soap can result in skin dryness and cause chronic irritant contact dermatitis.28 However[comma] in certain domestic[comma] public and institutional settings[comma] such as the household or schools[comma] where hands may become more soiled[comma] ABHR may be less likely to effectively inactivate microbes.82 83 As per current international guideline recommendations[comma] handwashing with soap may therefore be prioritised in these settings[comma] with ABHR as a suitable complement or alternative where frequent hand hygiene is required. Finally[comma] because the transmission of germs is more likely to occur to and from wet hands[comma] hand drying is an essential component of effective hand hygiene[comma] especially for handwashing.85 Current recommendations for hand drying in public and institutional settings are consistent with those in the WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care[comma] which recommend that hands should ideally be dried with individual paper towels[comma] otherwise with air dryers.28 While there is mixed evidence for the most effective hand drying method[comma]86 the WHO recommendations are based on findings that suggest that paper towels may effectively prevent recontamination of hands[comma] while also lowering the risk of spreading pathogens through the air compared with electric air dryers.85 Discordant recommendations for minimum requirements suggest the need to leverage further research to determine the optimal water quality for handwashing and effectiveness of alternative materials for hand hygiene where soap and ABHR are not widely available. Limited evidence suggests that the use of non-potable water with low-to-moderate levels of Escherichia coli contamination may still be effective for handwashing[comma]87 which may be promising for areas where it is difficult to regularly treat water or where there is intermittent water supply that is prone to contamination. Similarly[comma] two studies found that drinkable water may not be needed for handwashing with soap.88 89 Nevertheless[comma] the WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care recommend washing hands with clean[comma] running water whenever possible.28 While there are discordant recommendations for the use of ash[comma] there is uncertain evidence whether this stops or reduces the spread of pathogens compared with hand cleansing with soap[comma] mud[comma] soil or no hand cleansing.90 Future guidelines may consider the efficacy of hand hygiene products along with their availability and acceptability in domestic[comma] public and institutional settings to make relevant recommendations[comma] particularly in water-scarce regions or settings where there is limited access to soap or ABHR. For example[comma] soapy water may be a promising low-cost and effective alternative to bar soap in settings where bar or liquid soap is unaffordable.91 In addition[comma] one interim guideline on hand hygiene practices in low-resource settings[comma] for example[comma] recommends the use of friction-generating materials where clean[comma] running water[comma] soap or ABHR is not available.36 Current inconsistent recommendations for hand hygiene facilities and their placement may limit the practice of effective hand hygiene. Sustaining hand hygiene behaviour change requires consistent access to functional hand hygiene stations at key locations[comma]92 93 and diverse infrastructure is recommended with varying costs. Nonetheless[comma] the appropriateness of these recommendations is likely to depend on the local availability and affordability of materials. One guideline[comma] for example[comma] provides technical recommendations for permanent and semipermanent handwashing facilities in public places and buildings[comma] focusing on the sustainability and equitable access of these facilities.20 Similarly[comma] future guidelines may prioritise the accessibility[comma] affordability[comma] and sustainability of materials and infrastructure for hand hygiene across all community settings to address current inconsistent and discordant recommendations. The accessibility and sustainability of hand hygiene stations are particularly important to ensure that they are inclusive and kept functional and well stocked beyond their installation.20 Behaviour change The gaps in recommendations related to behaviour change suggest the need for guidance based on established behavioural theory and existing evidence. There are some recommendations for behaviour change[comma] though without clear steps on how to develop[comma] implement and sustain hand hygiene behaviour change interventions. Future guidelines may benefit from leveraging well-established behavioural frameworks and theories94–96 to make recommendations as to how to develop effective[comma] locally appropriate strategies beyond information-focused communication. In addition[comma] while most behaviour change theories and frameworks recommended among the guidelines note the importance of formative research[comma] very few guidelines recommend undertaking formative research. Yet[comma] formative research plays a key role in adapting hand hygiene behaviour change programmes to high-risk populations and target settings.97 Government measures The significant gaps in recommendations on government measures underscore the current lack of normative standards to guide national governments on the planning[comma] delivery[comma] financing and monitoring of effective hand hygiene. Indicators also suggest inadequate planning and insufficient funding for hand hygiene among national governments globally.19 Future guidelines may therefore consider prioritising government measures to support countries in responding to and preventing public health crises[comma] such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Future guidelines may also focus recommendations on hand hygiene monitoring and reporting to improve comparison of hand hygiene indicators within and between countries. Strengths and limitations This review has four main limitations. First[comma] as a scoping review[comma] we did not systematically assess the quality of the included guidelines[comma] although we did[comma] for example[comma] consider aspects such as the extent to which recommendations were based on cited evidence. In addition[comma] included guidelines covered WASH and public health topics beyond hand hygiene[comma] so it was thus not necessarily relevant to assess the whole guidelines for quality[comma] but rather focus on the robustness of the specific recommendations for hand hygiene. Second[comma] the search was limited to guidelines published in English or French and therefore may have excluded relevant guidelines published in other languages. Third[comma] the lack of recommendations for government measures among current international guidelines may not reflect an absolute absence of guidance in this area. Guidance to governments on how to improve uptake of hand hygiene practices in community settings may be included in other sector documents or policy instruments. Fourth[comma] while recommendations were summarised across domestic[comma] public and institutional settings[comma] there were often too few recommendations for each setting to assess consistency and concordance. Still[comma] with 51 guidelines providing over 900 recommendations for hand hygiene in community settings[comma] findings from this review highlight significant gaps and inconsistencies across community settings that future guidelines may seek to prioritise. Conclusion This review identified 51 current international guidelines providing 923 recommendations for hand hygiene in community settings. Nonetheless[comma] there are several important areas of discordance and significant gaps in the recommendations among these guidelines. Furthermore[comma] very few recommendations are supported by any qualifying evidence. The COVID-19 pandemic led to numerous national[comma] regional and international efforts to improve effective hand hygiene in domestic[comma] public and institutional settings[comma] such as households[comma] public spaces[comma] workplaces and schools[comma] but the lack of clear recommendations supported by cited evidence may limit progress in this important area of public health.
