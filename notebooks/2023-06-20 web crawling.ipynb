       "</p><p id=\"p-14\">Definitions of high value care have lacked input from a number of perspectives, including the people who are tasked with delivering it. There is a great deal of literature that attempts to define care that is value based.<a id=\"xref-ref-11-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-11\">11 14–16 20–24</a> However, these definitions typically provide broad overarching frameworks with few tangible actions that individual clinicians can take to improve the value of their care.<a id=\"xref-ref-11-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-11\">11 14–16 20–24</a> Most definitions of high value care are not specific to musculoskeletal conditions or physiotherapy care.<a id=\"xref-ref-20-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-20\">20–22 25 26</a> There is no consensus on the definition of high value musculoskeletal care for physiotherapists. Where literature is specific to physiotherapy, terms like high-quality care or evidence-based care are often conflated or used synonymously with high value care.<a id=\"xref-ref-13-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-13\">13 17 18 27–29</a> Without input from clinicians about high value care and how it applies to practice, definitions may lack clinically applicable information and any intended impact on care delivery is unlikely to be realised.</p><h3>Objectives</h3><p id=\"p-15\">We aimed to develop a physiotherapist-led consensus definition for, and statements about the provision of, high value care for musculoskeletal conditions. This study comprised three stages.</p><p id=\"p-16\">For stage one, we aimed to:</p><p id=\"p-17\">Synthesise the definitions currently used for (A) high value care and (B) high-quality care in physiotherapy for musculoskeletal conditions.</p><p id=\"p-18\">Identify themes that are common across the definitions.</p><p id=\"p-19\">Develop draft definitions of high value care and high-quality care for musculoskeletal conditions.</p><p id=\"p-20\">For stage two, we aimed to:</p><p id=\"p-21\">Gather feedback from physiotherapists in practice about our results from stage 1.</p><p id=\"p-22\">Generate draft statements about how physiotherapists provide high value care in practice.</p><p id=\"p-23\">For stage three, we aimed to:</p><p id=\"p-24\">1. Agree on final definitions and application statements among the participating physiotherapists via a consensus process.</p><h2 class=\"\">Methods</h2><p id=\"p-25\">We performed a three-stage study, which used adapted methods of the Research And Development/University of California Los Angeles Appropriateness Method (RAND/UCLA).<a id=\"xref-ref-30-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30</a> The RAND method was most appropriate for this study because it allows an expert panel to discuss the results of each round through survey and a face-to-face meeting.<a id=\"xref-ref-30-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30 31</a> Our full study protocol is available on Open Science Framework at <a href=\"https://osf.io/hdufv/\">https://osf.io/hdufv/</a>.<a id=\"xref-ref-32-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32</a>\n",
       "</p><h3>Participant characteristics</h3><p id=\"p-26\">We recruited participants from a practice-based research network of physiotherapists in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-1\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>). We included participants if they were:</p><p id=\"p-27\">A network member.</p><p id=\"p-28\">A registered physiotherapist.</p><p id=\"p-29\">Providing care for people with musculoskeletal conditions.</p><p id=\"p-30\" class=\"first-child\">Participant characteristics</p><p id=\"p-32\">We excluded network members who were not registered physiotherapists. Some study participants were also involved as working group members who assisted in data interpretation and contextualisation.</p><h4>Stage one: evidence review</h4><p id=\"p-33\">We undertook a rapid review of the literature to assess existing definitions of high value and high-quality care.</p><p id=\"p-34\">We searched three databases (Medline, Embase and Cinahl) using terms for value, quality and other synonyms, along with musculoskeletal and physiotherapy.<a id=\"xref-ref-33-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-33\">33 34</a> We used article reference lists, and internet search engines to pursue other sources and grey literature.<a id=\"xref-ref-34-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-34\">34</a> Authors (CG, BD and CMW) independently screened articles in duplicate. We thematically analysed data to establish common themes and develop draft definitions.<a id=\"xref-ref-35-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-35\">35</a> We refined definitions, themes and developed a conceptual model by discussing the relationship between themes.</p><p id=\"p-35\">We provided an interim report of our review results to all participants (found at <a href=\"https://osf.io/hdufv/\">https://osf.io/hdufv/</a>\n",
       "<a id=\"xref-ref-32-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32</a>) who provided their feedback in stage two.</p><h4>Stage two: network feedback</h4><p id=\"p-36\">Participants provided their feedback on the definitions, themes and conceptual model from stage one through online surveys and individual semistructured interviews.</p><p id=\"p-37\">We emailed all eligible participants (n=31, <a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-2\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>) the interim report, which included an invitation to complete a survey and volunteer for an interview. In the survey, participants provided data through Google Forms (Google, Alphabet). Survey questions included: whether participants thought any changes needed to be made; participants’ general perspectives on high value care; and what themes they would prioritise in clinical practice (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-1\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental appendix 1</a>).</p><h3 class=\"\">Supplemental material</h3><p id=\"p-39\">We held and recorded online interviews through Zoom.<a id=\"xref-ref-36-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-36\">36</a> In the interviews, we asked participants about the application of high value care from their clinical experience using the domains and themes from stage one as a discussion guide (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-2\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental appendix 1</a>).<a id=\"xref-ref-37-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-37\">37</a>\n",
       "</p><p id=\"p-40\">We cleaned and transcribed interviews onto Google documents (Google, Alphabet). Two authors coded survey data (CG and RG),<a id=\"xref-ref-38-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-38\">38</a> and CG coded all interview transcripts. Where participants answered the survey and took part in an interview, these data were coded as one case.<a id=\"xref-ref-38-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-38\">38</a> We brought similar codes together to form categories and themes,<a id=\"xref-ref-39-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-39\">39</a> using the original high value care model as a conceptual framework for theme development.<a id=\"xref-ref-40-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-40\">40 41</a> We aimed to generate themes in the form of (A) additions or changes to the original high value care model and (B) statements about application of high value care from the clinician’s perspective. CG proposed preliminary themes, which were then refined and finalised themes through discussion among a group of authors. We considered data saturation by assessing whether sequential interviews led to new themes; once no new themes were identified, we determined that the data were sufficiently saturated.<a id=\"xref-ref-42-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-42\">42 43</a> All authors involved in developing themes are physiotherapists with lived experience of providing care to people with musculoskeletal conditions and members of the same research network. Therefore, theme development is likely a shared endeavour where authors who analysed data shaped theme development through their own experience, and a clear delineation between participant data and the research team’s perspective cannot be made.<a id=\"xref-ref-44-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-44\">44</a>\n",
       "</p><p id=\"p-41\">Themes were summarised and incorporated into a new report and provided to all participants prior to the consensus meeting (found here: <a href=\"https://osf.io/hdufv/\">https://osf.io/hdufv/</a>).</p><h4>Stage three: consensus meeting</h4><p id=\"p-42\">We invited all eligible participants (n=31, <a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-3\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>) to the face-to-face consensus meeting through email. In reminder emails, we highlighted items that had been added during stage two and asked participants to prepare their thoughts for these items in advance.</p><p id=\"p-43\">The consensus meeting was four hours in length. Participants voted to agree or disagree on each addition or change to the original model and each application statement. CG and SJK facilitated the meeting. CG analysed the agenda items along with field notes and provided a summary report to participants. Following the meeting, we provided a final online document for comment and encouraged participants to comment on key areas of controversy.</p><p id=\"p-44\">Our procedure for gaining consensus during stage three was prespecified as:</p><p id=\"p-45\">All participants present voted on whether they agreed or disagreed to include changes and additions from step 2 in the final definitions and themes.</p><p id=\"p-46\">Consensus was reached if 80% or more participants agreed.</p><p id=\"p-47\">If no consensus was reached initially, we facilitated a discussion about the concept. We first heard from participants who did not agree to inclusion, then from participants who agreed to include the item.</p><p id=\"p-48\">If there was agreement on the general concept, we proposed items again with different wording and voted again.</p><p id=\"p-49\">If still no consensus reached, items were not included (we did not force consensus).</p><p id=\"p-50\">To set the level of agreement necessary for consensus, senior investigators first considered the normal limits of other consensus studies.<a id=\"xref-ref-45-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-45\">45</a> Senior investigators also considered that participant’s similar professional backgrounds would lead to high levels of agreement. However, it would likely have taken more than the available time to reach 100% agreement on all items. So, for pragmatic reasons, 100% agreement was not sought.</p><h3>Patients and public involvement</h3><p id=\"p-51\">We did not aim to involve patients and the public in this study, because we want to involve them in the next parts of our larger study which seeks to develop a more comprehensive model for high value care from the patient’s lens.</p><h2 class=\"\">Results</h2><h3>Stage one: evidence review</h3><p id=\"p-52\">Thirty-nine sources were included in data extraction and synthesis (for full results, including Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram, see <a href=\"https://osf.io/hdufv/\">https://osf.io/hdufv/</a>).<a id=\"xref-ref-32-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32 46</a> Twenty-five sources were academic journal articles (64%) and 14 (36%) were grey literature (government, international health body or professional organisation reports). Most (62%) sources provided high level conceptual guidance on high value care for health systems.<a id=\"xref-ref-11-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-11\">11–16 20–25 47–57</a> Only seven sources (18%) provided recommendations for individual clinicians to assist in high value care application.<a id=\"xref-ref-19-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-19\">19 28 29 53 58–61</a> Only one source (3%) involved care providers in developing clinical recommendations for osteoarthritis consultations.<a id=\"xref-ref-60-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-60\">60</a>\n",
       "</p><p id=\"p-53\">We found that high value care typically consists of four domains (patient values, cost-effectiveness, reducing waste and high-quality care) (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-2-1\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T2\">table 2</a>), in which high-quality care consists of seven themes (safe, connected, consistent, patient-centred, evidence based, equitable) (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-3-1\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T3\">table 3</a>). We summarised the contributory domains and themes to provide definitions for high value and high-quality care. We produced a conceptual model to illustrate the relationship between domains and themes, alongside the key stakeholders in care provision found in the literature (<a id=\"xref-fig-1-1\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F1\">figure 1</a>).</p><p id=\"p-54\" class=\"first-child\">High value care conceptual model.

We determined that data was sufficiently saturated after the ninth interview. We received eight responses that suggested changes to the model.</p><p id=\"p-59\">Quotes from interviews and surveys can be found in <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-3\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental appendix 2</a>. Participants’ feedback led to two additional high-quality care themes (effective and accountable). The top three themes were noted by participants when asked what domains or themes were most important in clinical practice: patient-centred (23/26 (88%)), evidence based (15/26 (57%)), reducing waste (12/26 (46%)). We generated an additional definition for low value care, and 21 statements on application (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-4\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental appendix 2</a>).<a id=\"xref-ref-32-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32</a>\n",
       "</p><h3>Stage three: consensus meeting</h3><p id=\"p-60\">Overall, 16/31 (52%) of participants attended the consensus meeting. <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-5\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">Online supplemental appendix 3</a> lists full results of the consensus meeting. Two additional themes for high-quality care reached consensus (effective and accountable care, <a id=\"xref-table-wrap-3-2\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T3\">table 3</a>), which were incorporated into our definitions and conceptual model. Consensus was reached on the additional definition of low value care. Fifteen application statements reached consensus. No disagreements were raised when we provided meeting participants with an opportunity to provide written feedback on the summary report.</p><h3>Final output</h3><p id=\"p-61\">The process resulted in the following definitions from physiotherapists’ perspectives.</p><h4>High value care</h4><p id=\"p-62\">Care that delivers most value for the patient, and the clinical benefits outweigh the costs to the individual or system providing the care. Within high value care there are four contributing domains: high-quality care; patient values; cost-effectiveness; reducing waste (see <a id=\"xref-table-wrap-2-2\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T2\">table 2</a> for further explanation of domains).</p><h4>High-quality care</h4><p id=\"p-63\">Evidence based, effective and safe care that is patient-centred, consistent, accountable, timely, equitable and allows easy interaction with healthcare providers and healthcare systems (connected) (see <a id=\"xref-table-wrap-3-3\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T3\">table 3</a> for details).</p><h4>Low value care</h4><p id=\"p-64\">Care that is not patient-centred, or aligned with the patient’s goals, and is ineffective and/or unnecessary.</p><p id=\"p-65\">The process also produced a conceptual model in <a id=\"xref-fig-1-2\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F1\">figure 1</a> that links the definitions with the context of care and 15 statements related to application of the domains and themes in practice (<a id=\"xref-fig-2-1\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F2\">figure 2</a>).</p><p id=\"p-66\" class=\"first-child\">Consensus generated statements to assist the clinical application of high value care for musculoskeletal conditions.</p><h3>Areas of disagreement</h3><p id=\"p-67\">\n",
       "<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-6\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">Online supplemental appendix 3</a> lists areas of disagreement. Six statements did not reach consensus. Of these, three statements were included as accompanying explanatory text to domains and themes. The other three were not included in our definitions or model. Other areas of disagreement are discussed under research implications.</p><h2 class=\"\">Discussion</h2><p id=\"p-68\">Our study adds clinicians’ perspectives to the body of literature defining high value musculoskeletal care. For physiotherapists, high value care is care that is high quality, incorporates patient values, is cost-effective and reduces waste in the care cycle. High-quality care is safe, connected, consistent, patient-centred, evidence based, timely, equitable, effective and accountable. We provide statements from the clinical perspective to assist with the application of high value care.</p><h3>Strengths and limitations</h3><p id=\"p-69\">This study used RAND/UCLA methodology to reach consensus and established protocols a priori.<a id=\"xref-ref-30-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30–32</a> All stages of this study (from conception to manuscript writing) were coproduced with a research network of physiotherapists, who predominantly work in private practice, which improves the credibility of our findings. However, the perspectives included in this study are unlikely be representative of all physiotherapists; our study involved members of a research network who likely share similar views and biases regarding care value and a minority of participants were female.<a id=\"xref-ref-62-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-62\">62</a> In stage three, voting was not anonymous, and participant’s votes may have been influenced by other members. Four participants left the consensus meeting before statement 15 (on equitable care), because they had other commitments to attend. However, none of the members who left provided any disagreement with the statement on the report following the workshop.</p><h3>Relation to previous literature</h3><p id=\"p-70\">Our study suggests there is more to value for practising clinicians than previously documented. While there is alignment with many domains and themes described in existing literature, participants in our highlighted the importance of additional themes for effective and accountable care in defining high value care. Previous definitions of value have focused on the economic implications of care and encompass a ratio of cost relative to care outcomes.<a id=\"xref-ref-16-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-16\">16 51</a> Previous definitions also state that value can only be determined when the outcome of care is known.<a id=\"xref-ref-16-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-16\">16 51</a> While the importance of care outcomes is obvious, our study highlights that clinicians think value may be achieved through the consideration of multiple domains, themes and stakeholder perspectives. This suggests that, in the eyes of clinicians, care value is a continuum that can be shaped by the process of care.</p><h3>Clinical implications</h3><h4>Application of high value care: general information</h4><p id=\"p-71\">Participants perceived high value musculoskeletal care to be a process, existing on a continuum, involving as many domains and themes as possible. Participants felt that being aware of different stakeholders’ perspectives is integral to high value care. Our study suggests that high value care must balance these potentially conflicting perspectives and anchor care decisions on achieving the optimal outcome from the patient’s perspective.</p><h4>Domains of high value care</h4><p id=\"p-72\">Funding structures may incentivise care options that lead to low value care (<a id=\"xref-fig-2-2\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F2\">figure 2</a>). Most participants in our study work in the Australian private sector.<a id=\"xref-ref-63-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-63\">63</a> In this setting, a clinician can either see more patients per hour or reduce the costs to deliver care to maximise their income and ensure cost-effective delivery of care.<a id=\"xref-ref-64-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-64\">64–66</a> Both options typically mean the clinician spends less time with the patient, which makes high value care less likely. To apply high value care, clinicians should be aware of the levers that might lead to low value care.<a id=\"xref-ref-64-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-64\">64–67</a>\n",
       "</p><p id=\"p-73\">Removing unnecessary and wasteful care is a key contributor to high value care provision.<a id=\"xref-ref-12-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12 13</a> Research on reducing waste commonly focuses on removing unnecessary tests and procedures from practice in discrete care episodes.<a id=\"xref-ref-12-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12 13</a> Participants in our study expressed that a wider focus is important and reported additional wasteful elements like unnecessary referrals to other professionals. Participants also reported that it may be important to focus on clinical reasoning as a potential source of waste.</p><p id=\"p-74\">In reducing waste from care, it is also important to explcitly define low value care because clinicians can understand what to avoid and remove from practice. The idea of avoiding low value care within musculoskeletal practice has traction within the literature.<a id=\"xref-ref-68-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-68\">68 69</a> Low value care has been defined as care that provides little to no benefit to patients or where the risk of harm exceeds likely benefits.<a id=\"xref-ref-70-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-70\">70</a> The perspective gained in our study may assist in making the attempts at reducing waste more clinically applicable. A key component of low value care is a misalignment with both patient’s preferences and their goals (see statement 5).</p><p id=\"p-75\">A key goal of high value care is aligning care outcomes to the patient’s values and experience of health.<a id=\"xref-ref-16-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-16\">16 25 51</a> Patient values have been described as, ‘moral beliefs to which people appealed for the ultimate rationales of action’ (Spates <em>et al</em>,<a id=\"xref-ref-71-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-71\">71</a> pp 3) and reflect deep-seeded motivations for behaviour and life choices.<a id=\"xref-ref-71-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-71\">71</a> Values can dictate what a patient will find valuable about the care process and care outcomes.<a id=\"xref-ref-72-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-72\">72</a> There are tools that clinicians can employ to better align care with the patient’s values.<a id=\"xref-ref-73-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-73\">73 74</a> For example, patient-reported outcome measures, patient-reported experience measures and shared decision-making tools.<a id=\"xref-ref-73-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-73\">73 74</a> These tools, however, may not allow an in-depth understanding of patient’s values. Skilled communication is a key mechanism to uncover a patient’s values.<a id=\"xref-ref-61-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-61\">61</a> Communication should involve a two-way information exchange between patient and clinician so that both parties can learn from each other’s perspective and knowledge.<a id=\"xref-ref-61-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-61\">61</a> An in-depth information exchange may contribute positive effects to care<a id=\"xref-ref-75-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-75\">75</a> but may also create value for the patient by improving their ability to make decisions about their health.<a id=\"xref-ref-76-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-76\">76</a>\n",
       "</p><h4>Applying themes of high-quality care</h4><p id=\"p-76\">A requirement for high-quality care is safe care (care that does not cause patient harm).<a id=\"xref-ref-47-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-47\">47</a> Evidence on harms from treatment has focused on biomedical harms like side effects caused by medications.<a id=\"xref-ref-77-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-77\">77</a> While important, evidence suggests that a traditional biomedical view on harms may not capture other sources of potential harm in care provision.<a id=\"xref-ref-78-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-78\">78–83</a> For example, the language used when communicating a diagnosis or imaging findings alter treatment intentions and initiate a low value treatment cascade leading to harm.<a id=\"xref-ref-80-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-80\">80 81</a> In our study, participants agreed that they should look beyond commonly considered harms like medication side effects (statement 12).</p><p id=\"p-77\">Participants in our study reported clinicians should strive to deliver care that is accountable. Peer review and auditing of clinical practice has promise to improve care standards.<a id=\"xref-ref-84-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-84\">84–87</a> Clinicians in our study agreed that they should be open to having their practice and clinical reasoning reviewed by peers (statement 11). Discussing thought processes that lead to care decisions among peers may uncover flaws in reasoning and lead to improvements in care.<a id=\"xref-ref-84-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-84\">84–87</a> There is evidence demonstrating that clinicians may be reluctant to expose their practice to auditing,<a id=\"xref-ref-88-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-88\">88–90</a> which indicates that some aspects of practice auditing may take effort. However, critical appraisal of clinical reasoning and care decisions is low hanging fruit that individual clinicians can implement without significant change to practice.</p><h3>Research implications</h3><p id=\"p-78\">A key direction for future research is to incorporate other stakeholder perspectives. The patient’s perspective is central to high value care; the immediate next step for future research is to involve the patient’s voice to understand their perspective on receiving high value care. Additionally, other musculoskeletal clinicians and care stakeholders should be involved to understand their perspectives. Our definitions, themes and model can function as a framework to assist in establishing a common language to discuss the concept of high value care. Following this next step, we recommend future research aims to understand the barriers and facilitators to applying our domains and themes to support better high value care application.</p><p id=\"p-79\">Our results suggest that clinicians perceive there to be a conceptual difference between the methods a clinician can successfully use to deliver evidence-based care and the traditional description of evidence-based care.<a id=\"xref-ref-91-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-91\">91</a> However, dissenting opinion around the accompanying statements for effective care may allude to the group’s uncertainty about the specific content and application of effective care. Consensus was also low for statement 14 about evidence-based care (<a id=\"xref-fig-2-3\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F2\">figure 2</a>). Future research should determine whether other populations describe something like effective care (the skills and process of applying evidence-based care). Currently, we cannot rule out a persistent misunderstanding of the concept of Sackett’s original outline of evidence-based practice, which has been described elsewhere.<a id=\"xref-ref-90-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-90\">90–93</a>\n",
       "</p><p id=\"p-80\">Future research on equity in primary care and physiotherapy is needed. Participants in our study described that access to private practice physiotherapy is not equitable when patients cannot cover the difference between the clinician’s fee for service and government funding options. Evidence suggests inequitable access to physiotherapy is a concern both in Australia and internationally.<a id=\"xref-ref-94-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-94\">94 95</a> However, access to care is only one aspect of equity. Equity is a very broad concept and poorly defined in the literature.<a id=\"xref-ref-96-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-96\">96</a> Dissenting opinion on statement 15 about equitable care (<a id=\"xref-fig-2-4\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F2\">figure 2</a>) may point to a lack of common language and confusion about what equity means.<a id=\"xref-ref-96-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-96\">96</a> Researchers should first provide a common language about equity, so clinicians can consider it in their practice more often.<a id=\"xref-ref-97-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-97\">97</a>\n",
       "</p><h3>Policy implications</h3><p id=\"p-81\">Clinicians’ input is important for policy-makers because they experience first-hand the judgements and resources that contribute to successful patient outcomes. Policy-makers have placed importance on clinician-led efforts to generate consensus on what constitutes low value care.<a id=\"xref-ref-98-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-98\">98–100</a> Our study data provide a framework through which to establish specific recommendations about high value care. Policy-makers should work with clinicians and consumers to collaboratively establish targets to incentivise high value care, which would supplement the disincentives for low value care.</p><p id=\"p-82\">Policy-makers can also learn from the clinical perspective to understand systemic factors that make high value care difficult. Clinicians in our study felt that economic drivers in primary care can lead to low value care. Policy-makers could trial different funding mechanisms in collaboration with care providers to determine the effects on care provision. Clinicians in our study viewed that economic factors may also impact equitable access of physiotherapy. Policy-makers could consider alternate mechanisms to improve access to care.</p><h2 class=\"\">Conclusion</h2><p id=\"p-83\">This work highlights a clinical perspective on high value care for musculoskeletal conditions. Providing high value care was viewed by physiotherapists as a comprehensive construct that involves more than providing evidence-based care. High value care includes high-quality care (safe, connected, consistent, patient centred, evidence based, timely, equitable and accountable care), incorporates patient values, is cost-effective, and reduces waste.</p><h2 class=\"\">Data availability statement</h2><p id=\"p-92\">Data are available on reasonable request.

We reviewed evidence about current definitions through a rapid literature review and then performed a survey and interviews with network members to gather consensus. Consensus was finalised in a face-to-face meeting.</p><p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Setting</strong> Australian primary care.</p><p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Participants</strong> Registered physiotherapists who are members of a practice-based research network (n=31).</p><p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Results</strong> The rapid review revealed two definitions, four domains of high value care and seven themes of high-quality care. Online survey responses (n=26) and interviews (n=9) generated two additional high-quality care themes, a definition of low-value care, and 21 statements on the application of high value care. Consensus was reached for three working definitions (high value, high-quality and low value care), a final model of four high value care domains (high-quality care, patient values, cost-effectiveness, reducing waste), nine high-quality care themes and 15 statements on application.</p><p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Conclusion</strong> High value care for musculoskeletal conditions delivers most value for the patient, and the clinical benefits outweigh the costs to the individual or system providing the care. High-quality care is evidence based, effective and safe care that is patient-centred, consistent, accountable, timely, equitable and allows easy interaction with healthcare providers and healthcare systems.</p><h2 class=\"\">Data availability statement</h2><p id=\"p-92\">Data are available on reasonable request.

      "</p><p id=\"p-14\">Definitions of high value care have lacked input from a number of perspectives, including the people who are tasked with delivering it. There is a great deal of literature that attempts to define care that is value based.<a id=\"xref-ref-11-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-11\">11 14–16 20–24</a> However, these definitions typically provide broad overarching frameworks with few tangible actions that individual clinicians can take to improve the value of their care.<a id=\"xref-ref-11-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-11\">11 14–16 20–24</a> Most definitions of high value care are not specific to musculoskeletal conditions or physiotherapy care.<a id=\"xref-ref-20-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-20\">20–22 25 26</a> There is no consensus on the definition of high value musculoskeletal care for physiotherapists. Where literature is specific to physiotherapy, terms like high-quality care or evidence-based care are often conflated or used synonymously with high value care.<a id=\"xref-ref-13-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-13\">13 17 18 27–29</a> Without input from clinicians about high value care and how it applies to practice, definitions may lack clinically applicable information and any intended impact on care delivery is unlikely to be realised.</p><h3>Objectives</h3><p id=\"p-15\">We aimed to develop a physiotherapist-led consensus definition for, and statements about the provision of, high value care for musculoskeletal conditions. This study comprised three stages.</p><p id=\"p-16\">For stage one, we aimed to:</p><p id=\"p-17\">Synthesise the definitions currently used for (A) high value care and (B) high-quality care in physiotherapy for musculoskeletal conditions.</p><p id=\"p-18\">Identify themes that are common across the definitions.</p><p id=\"p-19\">Develop draft definitions of high value care and high-quality care for musculoskeletal conditions.</p><p id=\"p-20\">For stage two, we aimed to:</p><p id=\"p-21\">Gather feedback from physiotherapists in practice about our results from stage 1.</p><p id=\"p-22\">Generate draft statements about how physiotherapists provide high value care in practice.</p><p id=\"p-23\">For stage three, we aimed to:</p><p id=\"p-24\">1. Agree on final definitions and application statements among the participating physiotherapists via a consensus process.</p><h2 class=\"\">Methods</h2><p id=\"p-25\">We performed a three-stage study, which used adapted methods of the Research And Development/University of California Los Angeles Appropriateness Method (RAND/UCLA).<a id=\"xref-ref-30-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30</a> The RAND method was most appropriate for this study because it allows an expert panel to discuss the results of each round through survey and a face-to-face meeting.<a id=\"xref-ref-30-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30 31</a> Our full study protocol is available on Open Science Framework at <a href=\"https://osf.io/hdufv/\">https://osf.io/hdufv/</a>.<a id=\"xref-ref-32-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32</a>\n",
      "</p><h3>Participant characteristics</h3><p id=\"p-26\">We recruited participants from a practice-based research network of physiotherapists in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-1\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>). We included participants if they were:</p><p id=\"p-27\">A network member.</p><p id=\"p-28\">A registered physiotherapist.</p><p id=\"p-29\">Providing care for people with musculoskeletal conditions.</p><p id=\"p-30\" class=\"first-child\">Participant characteristics</p><p id=\"p-32\">We excluded network members who were not registered physiotherapists. Some study participants were also involved as working group members who assisted in data interpretation and contextualisation.</p><h4>Stage one: evidence review</h4><p id=\"p-33\">We undertook a rapid review of the literature to assess existing definitions of high value and high-quality care.</p><p id=\"p-34\">We searched three databases (Medline, Embase and Cinahl) using terms for value, quality and other synonyms, along with musculoskeletal and physiotherapy.<a id=\"xref-ref-33-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-33\">33 34</a> We used article reference lists, and internet search engines to pursue other sources and grey literature.<a id=\"xref-ref-34-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-34\">34</a> Authors (CG, BD and CMW) independently screened articles in duplicate. We thematically analysed data to establish common themes and develop draft definitions.<a id=\"xref-ref-35-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-35\">35</a> We refined definitions, themes and developed a conceptual model by discussing the relationship between themes.</p><p id=\"p-35\">We provided an interim report of our review results to all participants (found at <a href=\"https://osf.io/hdufv/\">https://osf.io/hdufv/</a>\n",
      "<a id=\"xref-ref-32-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32</a>) who provided their feedback in stage two.</p><h4>Stage two: network feedback</h4><p id=\"p-36\">Participants provided their feedback on the definitions, themes and conceptual model from stage one through online surveys and individual semistructured interviews.</p><p id=\"p-37\">We emailed all eligible participants (n=31, <a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-2\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>) the interim report, which included an invitation to complete a survey and volunteer for an interview. In the survey, participants provided data through Google Forms (Google, Alphabet). Survey questions included: whether participants thought any changes needed to be made; participants’ general perspectives on high value care; and what themes they would prioritise in clinical practice (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-1\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental appendix 1</a>).</p><h3 class=\"\">Supplemental material</h3><p id=\"p-39\">We held and recorded online interviews through Zoom.<a id=\"xref-ref-36-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-36\">36</a> In the interviews, we asked participants about the application of high value care from their clinical experience using the domains and themes from stage one as a discussion guide (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-2\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental appendix 1</a>).<a id=\"xref-ref-37-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-37\">37</a>\n",
      "</p><p id=\"p-40\">We cleaned and transcribed interviews onto Google documents (Google, Alphabet). Two authors coded survey data (CG and RG),<a id=\"xref-ref-38-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-38\">38</a> and CG coded all interview transcripts. Where participants answered the survey and took part in an interview, these data were coded as one case.<a id=\"xref-ref-38-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-38\">38</a> We brought similar codes together to form categories and themes,<a id=\"xref-ref-39-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-39\">39</a> using the original high value care model as a conceptual framework for theme development.<a id=\"xref-ref-40-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-40\">40 41</a> We aimed to generate themes in the form of (A) additions or changes to the original high value care model and (B) statements about application of high value care from the clinician’s perspective. CG proposed preliminary themes, which were then refined and finalised themes through discussion among a group of authors. We considered data saturation by assessing whether sequential interviews led to new themes; once no new themes were identified, we determined that the data were sufficiently saturated.<a id=\"xref-ref-42-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-42\">42 43</a> All authors involved in developing themes are physiotherapists with lived experience of providing care to people with musculoskeletal conditions and members of the same research network. Therefore, theme development is likely a shared endeavour where authors who analysed data shaped theme development through their own experience, and a clear delineation between participant data and the research team’s perspective cannot be made.<a id=\"xref-ref-44-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-44\">44</a>\n",
      "</p><p id=\"p-41\">Themes were summarised and incorporated into a new report and provided to all participants prior to the consensus meeting (found here: <a href=\"https://osf.io/hdufv/\">https://osf.io/hdufv/</a>).</p><h4>Stage three: consensus meeting</h4><p id=\"p-42\">We invited all eligible participants (n=31, <a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-3\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>) to the face-to-face consensus meeting through email. In reminder emails, we highlighted items that had been added during stage two and asked participants to prepare their thoughts for these items in advance.</p><p id=\"p-43\">The consensus meeting was four hours in length. Participants voted to agree or disagree on each addition or change to the original model and each application statement. CG and SJK facilitated the meeting. CG analysed the agenda items along with field notes and provided a summary report to participants. Following the meeting, we provided a final online document for comment and encouraged participants to comment on key areas of controversy.</p><p id=\"p-44\">Our procedure for gaining consensus during stage three was prespecified as:</p><p id=\"p-45\">All participants present voted on whether they agreed or disagreed to include changes and additions from step 2 in the final definitions and themes.</p><p id=\"p-46\">Consensus was reached if 80% or more participants agreed.</p><p id=\"p-47\">If no consensus was reached initially, we facilitated a discussion about the concept. We first heard from participants who did not agree to inclusion, then from participants who agreed to include the item.</p><p id=\"p-48\">If there was agreement on the general concept, we proposed items again with different wording and voted again.</p><p id=\"p-49\">If still no consensus reached, items were not included (we did not force consensus).</p><p id=\"p-50\">To set the level of agreement necessary for consensus, senior investigators first considered the normal limits of other consensus studies.<a id=\"xref-ref-45-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-45\">45</a> Senior investigators also considered that participant’s similar professional backgrounds would lead to high levels of agreement. However, it would likely have taken more than the available time to reach 100% agreement on all items. So, for pragmatic reasons, 100% agreement was not sought.</p><h3>Patients and public involvement</h3><p id=\"p-51\">We did not aim to involve patients and the public in this study, because we want to involve them in the next parts of our larger study which seeks to develop a more comprehensive model for high value care from the patient’s lens.</p><h2 class=\"\">Results</h2><h3>Stage one: evidence review</h3><p id=\"p-52\">Thirty-nine sources were included in data extraction and synthesis (for full results, including Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram, see <a href=\"https://osf.io/hdufv/\">https://osf.io/hdufv/</a>).<a id=\"xref-ref-32-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32 46</a> Twenty-five sources were academic journal articles (64%) and 14 (36%) were grey literature (government, international health body or professional organisation reports). Most (62%) sources provided high level conceptual guidance on high value care for health systems.<a id=\"xref-ref-11-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-11\">11–16 20–25 47–57</a> Only seven sources (18%) provided recommendations for individual clinicians to assist in high value care application.<a id=\"xref-ref-19-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-19\">19 28 29 53 58–61</a> Only one source (3%) involved care providers in developing clinical recommendations for osteoarthritis consultations.<a id=\"xref-ref-60-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-60\">60</a>\n",
      "</p><p id=\"p-53\">We found that high value care typically consists of four domains (patient values, cost-effectiveness, reducing waste and high-quality care) (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-2-1\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T2\">table 2</a>), in which high-quality care consists of seven themes (safe, connected, consistent, patient-centred, evidence based, equitable) (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-3-1\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T3\">table 3</a>). We summarised the contributory domains and themes to provide definitions for high value and high-quality care. We produced a conceptual model to illustrate the relationship between domains and themes, alongside the key stakeholders in care provision found in the literature (<a id=\"xref-fig-1-1\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F1\">figure 1</a>).</p><p id=\"p-54\" class=\"first-child\">High value care conceptual model.

Participants’ feedback led to two additional high-quality care themes (effective and accountable). The top three themes were noted by participants when asked what domains or themes were most important in clinical practice: patient-centred (23/26 (88%)), evidence based (15/26 (57%)), reducing waste (12/26 (46%)). We generated an additional definition for low value care, and 21 statements on application (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-4\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental appendix 2</a>).<a id=\"xref-ref-32-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32</a>\n",
      "</p><h3>Stage three: consensus meeting</h3><p id=\"p-60\">Overall, 16/31 (52%) of participants attended the consensus meeting. <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-5\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">Online supplemental appendix 3</a> lists full results of the consensus meeting. Two additional themes for high-quality care reached consensus (effective and accountable care, <a id=\"xref-table-wrap-3-2\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T3\">table 3</a>), which were incorporated into our definitions and conceptual model. Consensus was reached on the additional definition of low value care. Fifteen application statements reached consensus. No disagreements were raised when we provided meeting participants with an opportunity to provide written feedback on the summary report.</p><h3>Final output</h3><p id=\"p-61\">The process resulted in the following definitions from physiotherapists’ perspectives.</p><h4>High value care</h4><p id=\"p-62\">Care that delivers most value for the patient, and the clinical benefits outweigh the costs to the individual or system providing the care. Within high value care there are four contributing domains: high-quality care; patient values; cost-effectiveness; reducing waste (see <a id=\"xref-table-wrap-2-2\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T2\">table 2</a> for further explanation of domains).</p><h4>High-quality care</h4><p id=\"p-63\">Evidence based, effective and safe care that is patient-centred, consistent, accountable, timely, equitable and allows easy interaction with healthcare providers and healthcare systems (connected) (see <a id=\"xref-table-wrap-3-3\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T3\">table 3</a> for details).</p><h4>Low value care</h4><p id=\"p-64\">Care that is not patient-centred, or aligned with the patient’s goals, and is ineffective and/or unnecessary.</p><p id=\"p-65\">The process also produced a conceptual model in <a id=\"xref-fig-1-2\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F1\">figure 1</a> that links the definitions with the context of care and 15 statements related to application of the domains and themes in practice (<a id=\"xref-fig-2-1\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F2\">figure 2</a>).</p><p id=\"p-66\" class=\"first-child\">Consensus generated statements to assist the clinical application of high value care for musculoskeletal conditions.</p><h3>Areas of disagreement</h3><p id=\"p-67\">\n",
      "<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-6\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">Online supplemental appendix 3</a> lists areas of disagreement. Six statements did not reach consensus. Of these, three statements were included as accompanying explanatory text to domains and themes. The other three were not included in our definitions or model. Other areas of disagreement are discussed under research implications.</p><h2 class=\"\">Discussion</h2><p id=\"p-68\">Our study adds clinicians’ perspectives to the body of literature defining high value musculoskeletal care. For physiotherapists, high value care is care that is high quality, incorporates patient values, is cost-effective and reduces waste in the care cycle. High-quality care is safe, connected, consistent, patient-centred, evidence based, timely, equitable, effective and accountable. We provide statements from the clinical perspective to assist with the application of high value care.</p><h3>Strengths and limitations</h3><p id=\"p-69\">This study used RAND/UCLA methodology to reach consensus and established protocols a priori.<a id=\"xref-ref-30-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30–32</a> All stages of this study (from conception to manuscript writing) were coproduced with a research network of physiotherapists, who predominantly work in private practice, which improves the credibility of our findings. However, the perspectives included in this study are unlikely be representative of all physiotherapists; our study involved members of a research network who likely share similar views and biases regarding care value and a minority of participants were female.<a id=\"xref-ref-62-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-62\">62</a> In stage three, voting was not anonymous, and participant’s votes may have been influenced by other members. Four participants left the consensus meeting before statement 15 (on equitable care), because they had other commitments to attend. However, none of the members who left provided any disagreement with the statement on the report following the workshop.</p><h3>Relation to previous literature</h3><p id=\"p-70\">Our study suggests there is more to value for practising clinicians than previously documented. While there is alignment with many domains and themes described in existing literature, participants in our highlighted the importance of additional themes for effective and accountable care in defining high value care. Previous definitions of value have focused on the economic implications of care and encompass a ratio of cost relative to care outcomes.<a id=\"xref-ref-16-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-16\">16 51</a> Previous definitions also state that value can only be determined when the outcome of care is known.<a id=\"xref-ref-16-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-16\">16 51</a> While the importance of care outcomes is obvious, our study highlights that clinicians think value may be achieved through the consideration of multiple domains, themes and stakeholder perspectives. This suggests that, in the eyes of clinicians, care value is a continuum that can be shaped by the process of care.</p><h3>Clinical implications</h3><h4>Application of high value care: general information</h4><p id=\"p-71\">Participants perceived high value musculoskeletal care to be a process, existing on a continuum, involving as many domains and themes as possible. Participants felt that being aware of different stakeholders’ perspectives is integral to high value care. Our study suggests that high value care must balance these potentially conflicting perspectives and anchor care decisions on achieving the optimal outcome from the patient’s perspective.</p><h4>Domains of high value care</h4><p id=\"p-72\">Funding structures may incentivise care options that lead to low value care (<a id=\"xref-fig-2-2\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F2\">figure 2</a>). Most participants in our study work in the Australian private sector.<a id=\"xref-ref-63-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-63\">63</a> In this setting, a clinician can either see more patients per hour or reduce the costs to deliver care to maximise their income and ensure cost-effective delivery of care.<a id=\"xref-ref-64-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-64\">64–66</a> Both options typically mean the clinician spends less time with the patient, which makes high value care less likely. To apply high value care, clinicians should be aware of the levers that might lead to low value care.<a id=\"xref-ref-64-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-64\">64–67</a>\n",
      "</p><p id=\"p-73\">Removing unnecessary and wasteful care is a key contributor to high value care provision.<a id=\"xref-ref-12-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12 13</a> Research on reducing waste commonly focuses on removing unnecessary tests and procedures from practice in discrete care episodes.<a id=\"xref-ref-12-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12 13</a> Participants in our study expressed that a wider focus is important and reported additional wasteful elements like unnecessary referrals to other professionals. Participants also reported that it may be important to focus on clinical reasoning as a potential source of waste.</p><p id=\"p-74\">In reducing waste from care, it is also important to explcitly define low value care because clinicians can understand what to avoid and remove from practice. The idea of avoiding low value care within musculoskeletal practice has traction within the literature.<a id=\"xref-ref-68-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-68\">68 69</a> Low value care has been defined as care that provides little to no benefit to patients or where the risk of harm exceeds likely benefits.<a id=\"xref-ref-70-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-70\">70</a> The perspective gained in our study may assist in making the attempts at reducing waste more clinically applicable. A key component of low value care is a misalignment with both patient’s preferences and their goals (see statement 5).</p><p id=\"p-75\">A key goal of high value care is aligning care outcomes to the patient’s values and experience of health.<a id=\"xref-ref-16-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-16\">16 25 51</a> Patient values have been described as, ‘moral beliefs to which people appealed for the ultimate rationales of action’ (Spates <em>et al</em>,<a id=\"xref-ref-71-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-71\">71</a> pp 3) and reflect deep-seeded motivations for behaviour and life choices.<a id=\"xref-ref-71-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-71\">71</a> Values can dictate what a patient will find valuable about the care process and care outcomes.<a id=\"xref-ref-72-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-72\">72</a> There are tools that clinicians can employ to better align care with the patient’s values.<a id=\"xref-ref-73-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-73\">73 74</a> For example, patient-reported outcome measures, patient-reported experience measures and shared decision-making tools.<a id=\"xref-ref-73-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-73\">73 74</a> These tools, however, may not allow an in-depth understanding of patient’s values. Skilled communication is a key mechanism to uncover a patient’s values.<a id=\"xref-ref-61-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-61\">61</a> Communication should involve a two-way information exchange between patient and clinician so that both parties can learn from each other’s perspective and knowledge.<a id=\"xref-ref-61-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-61\">61</a> An in-depth information exchange may contribute positive effects to care<a id=\"xref-ref-75-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-75\">75</a> but may also create value for the patient by improving their ability to make decisions about their health.<a id=\"xref-ref-76-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-76\">76</a>\n",
      "</p><h4>Applying themes of high-quality care</h4><p id=\"p-76\">A requirement for high-quality care is safe care (care that does not cause patient harm).<a id=\"xref-ref-47-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-47\">47</a> Evidence on harms from treatment has focused on biomedical harms like side effects caused by medications.<a id=\"xref-ref-77-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-77\">77</a> While important, evidence suggests that a traditional biomedical view on harms may not capture other sources of potential harm in care provision.<a id=\"xref-ref-78-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-78\">78–83</a> For example, the language used when communicating a diagnosis or imaging findings alter treatment intentions and initiate a low value treatment cascade leading to harm.<a id=\"xref-ref-80-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-80\">80 81</a> In our study, participants agreed that they should look beyond commonly considered harms like medication side effects (statement 12).</p><p id=\"p-77\">Participants in our study reported clinicians should strive to deliver care that is accountable. Peer review and auditing of clinical practice has promise to improve care standards.<a id=\"xref-ref-84-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-84\">84–87</a> Clinicians in our study agreed that they should be open to having their practice and clinical reasoning reviewed by peers (statement 11). Discussing thought processes that lead to care decisions among peers may uncover flaws in reasoning and lead to improvements in care.<a id=\"xref-ref-84-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-84\">84–87</a> There is evidence demonstrating that clinicians may be reluctant to expose their practice to auditing,<a id=\"xref-ref-88-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-88\">88–90</a> which indicates that some aspects of practice auditing may take effort. However, critical appraisal of clinical reasoning and care decisions is low hanging fruit that individual clinicians can implement without significant change to practice.</p><h3>Research implications</h3><p id=\"p-78\">A key direction for future research is to incorporate other stakeholder perspectives. The patient’s perspective is central to high value care; the immediate next step for future research is to involve the patient’s voice to understand their perspective on receiving high value care. Additionally, other musculoskeletal clinicians and care stakeholders should be involved to understand their perspectives. Our definitions, themes and model can function as a framework to assist in establishing a common language to discuss the concept of high value care. Following this next step, we recommend future research aims to understand the barriers and facilitators to applying our domains and themes to support better high value care application.</p><p id=\"p-79\">Our results suggest that clinicians perceive there to be a conceptual difference between the methods a clinician can successfully use to deliver evidence-based care and the traditional description of evidence-based care.<a id=\"xref-ref-91-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-91\">91</a> However, dissenting opinion around the accompanying statements for effective care may allude to the group’s uncertainty about the specific content and application of effective care. Consensus was also low for statement 14 about evidence-based care (<a id=\"xref-fig-2-3\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F2\">figure 2</a>). Future research should determine whether other populations describe something like effective care (the skills and process of applying evidence-based care). Currently, we cannot rule out a persistent misunderstanding of the concept of Sackett’s original outline of evidence-based practice, which has been described elsewhere.<a id=\"xref-ref-90-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-90\">90–93</a>\n",
      "</p><p id=\"p-80\">Future research on equity in primary care and physiotherapy is needed. Participants in our study described that access to private practice physiotherapy is not equitable when patients cannot cover the difference between the clinician’s fee for service and government funding options. Evidence suggests inequitable access to physiotherapy is a concern both in Australia and internationally.<a id=\"xref-ref-94-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-94\">94 95</a> However, access to care is only one aspect of equity. Equity is a very broad concept and poorly defined in the literature.<a id=\"xref-ref-96-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-96\">96</a> Dissenting opinion on statement 15 about equitable care (<a id=\"xref-fig-2-4\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F2\">figure 2</a>) may point to a lack of common language and confusion about what equity means.<a id=\"xref-ref-96-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-96\">96</a> Researchers should first provide a common language about equity, so clinicians can consider it in their practice more often.<a id=\"xref-ref-97-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-97\">97</a>\n",
      "</p><h3>Policy implications</h3><p id=\"p-81\">Clinicians’ input is important for policy-makers because they experience first-hand the judgements and resources that contribute to successful patient outcomes. Policy-makers have placed importance on clinician-led efforts to generate consensus on what constitutes low value care.<a id=\"xref-ref-98-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-98\">98–100</a> Our study data provide a framework through which to establish specific recommendations about high value care. Policy-makers should work with clinicians and consumers to collaboratively establish targets to incentivise high value care, which would supplement the disincentives for low value care.</p><p id=\"p-82\">Policy-makers can also learn from the clinical perspective to understand systemic factors that make high value care difficult. Clinicians in our study felt that economic drivers in primary care can lead to low value care. Policy-makers could trial different funding mechanisms in collaboration with care providers to determine the effects on care provision. Clinicians in our study viewed that economic factors may also impact equitable access of physiotherapy. Policy-makers could consider alternate mechanisms to improve access to care.</p><h2 class=\"\">Conclusion</h2><p id=\"p-83\">This work highlights a clinical perspective on high value care for musculoskeletal conditions. Providing high value care was viewed by physiotherapists as a comprehensive construct that involves more than providing evidence-based care. High value care includes high-quality care (safe, connected, consistent, patient centred, evidence based, timely, equitable and accountable care), incorporates patient values, is cost-effective, and reduces waste.</p><h2 class=\"\">Data availability statement</h2><p id=\"p-92\">Data are available on reasonable request.

       "<h2 class=\"\">Introduction</h2><p id=\"p-13\">Musculoskeletal conditions are prevalent and are the leading cause of years lost to disability worldwide.<a id=\"xref-ref-1-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-1\">1 2</a> Due to population growth and ageing, the global musculoskeletal burden is predicted to increase.<a id=\"xref-ref-1-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-1\">1–5</a> Healthcare spending associated with musculoskeletal care typically outstrips spending on other health conditions.<a id=\"xref-ref-6-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-6\">6–10</a> To address the growing musculoskeletal burden, there are increasing calls to provide high value care.<a id=\"xref-ref-11-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-11\">11–15</a> High value care aims to provide cost-effective care that optimises patient outcomes.<a id=\"xref-ref-16-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-16\">16</a> All healthcare professionals, including physiotherapists, should aim to deliver high value care.<a id=\"xref-ref-17-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-17\">17–19</a>\n",
       "</p><p id=\"p-14\">Definitions of high value care have lacked input from a number of perspectives, including the people who are tasked with delivering it. There is a great deal of literature that attempts to define care that is value based.<a id=\"xref-ref-11-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-11\">11 14–16 20–24</a> However, these definitions typically provide broad overarching frameworks with few tangible actions that individual clinicians can take to improve the value of their care.<a id=\"xref-ref-11-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-11\">11 14–16 20–24</a> Most definitions of high value care are not specific to musculoskeletal conditions or physiotherapy care.<a id=\"xref-ref-20-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-20\">20–22 25 26</a> There is no consensus on the definition of high value musculoskeletal care for physiotherapists. Where literature is specific to physiotherapy, terms like high-quality care or evidence-based care are often conflated or used synonymously with high value care.<a id=\"xref-ref-13-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-13\">13 17 18 27–29</a> Without input from clinicians about high value care and how it applies to practice, definitions may lack clinically applicable information and any intended impact on care delivery is unlikely to be realised.</p><h3>Objectives</h3><p id=\"p-15\">We aimed to develop a physiotherapist-led consensus definition for, and statements about the provision of, high value care for musculoskeletal conditions. This study comprised three stages.</p><p id=\"p-16\">For stage one, we aimed to:</p><p id=\"p-17\">Synthesise the definitions currently used for (A) high value care and (B) high-quality care in physiotherapy for musculoskeletal conditions.</p><p id=\"p-18\">Identify themes that are common across the definitions.</p><p id=\"p-19\">Develop draft definitions of high value care and high-quality care for musculoskeletal conditions.</p><p id=\"p-20\">For stage two, we aimed to:</p><p id=\"p-21\">Gather feedback from physiotherapists in practice about our results from stage 1.</p><p id=\"p-22\">Generate draft statements about how physiotherapists provide high value care in practice.</p><p id=\"p-23\">For stage three, we aimed to:</p><p id=\"p-24\">1. Agree on final definitions and application statements among the participating physiotherapists via a consensus process.</p><h2 class=\"\">Methods</h2><p id=\"p-25\">We performed a three-stage study, which used adapted methods of the Research And Development/University of California Los Angeles Appropriateness Method (RAND/UCLA).<a id=\"xref-ref-30-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30</a> The RAND method was most appropriate for this study because it allows an expert panel to discuss the results of each round through survey and a face-to-face meeting.<a id=\"xref-ref-30-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30 31</a> Our full study protocol is available on Open Science Framework at <a href=\"https://osf.io/hdufv/\">https://osf.io/hdufv/</a>.<a id=\"xref-ref-32-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32</a>\n",
       "</p><h3>Participant characteristics</h3><p id=\"p-26\">We recruited participants from a practice-based research network of physiotherapists in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-1\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>). We included participants if they were:</p><p id=\"p-27\">A network member.</p><p id=\"p-28\">A registered physiotherapist.</p><p id=\"p-29\">Providing care for people with musculoskeletal conditions.</p><p id=\"p-30\" class=\"first-child\">Participant characteristics</p><p id=\"p-32\">We excluded network members who were not registered physiotherapists. Some study participants were also involved as working group members who assisted in data interpretation and contextualisation.</p><h4>Stage one: evidence review</h4><p id=\"p-33\">We undertook a rapid review of the literature to assess existing definitions of high value and high-quality care.</p><p id=\"p-34\">We searched three databases (Medline, Embase and Cinahl) using terms for value, quality and other synonyms, along with musculoskeletal and physiotherapy.<a id=\"xref-ref-33-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-33\">33 34</a> We used article reference lists, and internet search engines to pursue other sources and grey literature.<a id=\"xref-ref-34-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-34\">34</a> Authors (CG, BD and CMW) independently screened articles in duplicate. We thematically analysed data to establish common themes and develop draft definitions.<a id=\"xref-ref-35-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-35\">35</a> We refined definitions, themes and developed a conceptual model by discussing the relationship between themes.</p><p id=\"p-35\">We provided an interim report of our review results to all participants (found at <a href=\"https://osf.io/hdufv/\">https://osf.io/hdufv/</a>\n",
       "<a id=\"xref-ref-32-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32</a>) who provided their feedback in stage two.</p><h4>Stage two: network feedback</h4><p id=\"p-36\">Participants provided their feedback on the definitions, themes and conceptual model from stage one through online surveys and individual semistructured interviews.</p><p id=\"p-37\">We emailed all eligible participants (n=31, <a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-2\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>) the interim report, which included an invitation to complete a survey and volunteer for an interview. In the survey, participants provided data through Google Forms (Google, Alphabet). Survey questions included: whether participants thought any changes needed to be made; participants’ general perspectives on high value care; and what themes they would prioritise in clinical practice (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-1\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental appendix 1</a>).</p><h3 class=\"\">Supplemental material</h3><p id=\"p-39\">We held and recorded online interviews through Zoom.<a id=\"xref-ref-36-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-36\">36</a> In the interviews, we asked participants about the application of high value care from their clinical experience using the domains and themes from stage one as a discussion guide (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-2\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental appendix 1</a>).<a id=\"xref-ref-37-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-37\">37</a>\n",
       "</p><p id=\"p-40\">We cleaned and transcribed interviews onto Google documents (Google, Alphabet). Two authors coded survey data (CG and RG),<a id=\"xref-ref-38-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-38\">38</a> and CG coded all interview transcripts. Where participants answered the survey and took part in an interview, these data were coded as one case.<a id=\"xref-ref-38-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-38\">38</a> We brought similar codes together to form categories and themes,<a id=\"xref-ref-39-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-39\">39</a> using the original high value care model as a conceptual framework for theme development.<a id=\"xref-ref-40-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-40\">40 41</a> We aimed to generate themes in the form of (A) additions or changes to the original high value care model and (B) statements about application of high value care from the clinician’s perspective. CG proposed preliminary themes, which were then refined and finalised themes through discussion among a group of authors. We considered data saturation by assessing whether sequential interviews led to new themes; once no new themes were identified, we determined that the data were sufficiently saturated.<a id=\"xref-ref-42-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-42\">42 43</a> All authors involved in developing themes are physiotherapists with lived experience of providing care to people with musculoskeletal conditions and members of the same research network. Therefore, theme development is likely a shared endeavour where authors who analysed data shaped theme development through their own experience, and a clear delineation between participant data and the research team’s perspective cannot be made.<a id=\"xref-ref-44-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-44\">44</a>\n",
       "</p><p id=\"p-41\">Themes were summarised and incorporated into a new report and provided to all participants prior to the consensus meeting (found here: <a href=\"https://osf.io/hdufv/\">https://osf.io/hdufv/</a>).</p><h4>Stage three: consensus meeting</h4><p id=\"p-42\">We invited all eligible participants (n=31, <a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-3\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>) to the face-to-face consensus meeting through email. In reminder emails, we highlighted items that had been added during stage two and asked participants to prepare their thoughts for these items in advance.</p><p id=\"p-43\">The consensus meeting was four hours in length. Participants voted to agree or disagree on each addition or change to the original model and each application statement. CG and SJK facilitated the meeting. CG analysed the agenda items along with field notes and provided a summary report to participants. Following the meeting, we provided a final online document for comment and encouraged participants to comment on key areas of controversy.</p><p id=\"p-44\">Our procedure for gaining consensus during stage three was prespecified as:</p><p id=\"p-45\">All participants present voted on whether they agreed or disagreed to include changes and additions from step 2 in the final definitions and themes.</p><p id=\"p-46\">Consensus was reached if 80% or more participants agreed.</p><p id=\"p-47\">If no consensus was reached initially, we facilitated a discussion about the concept. We first heard from participants who did not agree to inclusion, then from participants who agreed to include the item.</p><p id=\"p-48\">If there was agreement on the general concept, we proposed items again with different wording and voted again.</p><p id=\"p-49\">If still no consensus reached, items were not included (we did not force consensus).</p><p id=\"p-50\">To set the level of agreement necessary for consensus, senior investigators first considered the normal limits of other consensus studies.<a id=\"xref-ref-45-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-45\">45</a> Senior investigators also considered that participant’s similar professional backgrounds would lead to high levels of agreement. However, it would likely have taken more than the available time to reach 100% agreement on all items. So, for pragmatic reasons, 100% agreement was not sought.</p><h3>Patients and public involvement</h3><p id=\"p-51\">We did not aim to involve patients and the public in this study, because we want to involve them in the next parts of our larger study which seeks to develop a more comprehensive model for high value care from the patient’s lens.</p><h2 class=\"\">Results</h2><h3>Stage one: evidence review</h3><p id=\"p-52\">Thirty-nine sources were included in data extraction and synthesis (for full results, including Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram, see <a href=\"https://osf.io/hdufv/\">https://osf.io/hdufv/</a>).<a id=\"xref-ref-32-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32 46</a> Twenty-five sources were academic journal articles (64%) and 14 (36%) were grey literature (government, international health body or professional organisation reports). Most (62%) sources provided high level conceptual guidance on high value care for health systems.<a id=\"xref-ref-11-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-11\">11–16 20–25 47–57</a> Only seven sources (18%) provided recommendations for individual clinicians to assist in high value care application.<a id=\"xref-ref-19-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-19\">19 28 29 53 58–61</a> Only one source (3%) involved care providers in developing clinical recommendations for osteoarthritis consultations.<a id=\"xref-ref-60-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-60\">60</a>\n",
       "</p><p id=\"p-53\">We found that high value care typically consists of four domains (patient values, cost-effectiveness, reducing waste and high-quality care) (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-2-1\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T2\">table 2</a>), in which high-quality care consists of seven themes (safe, connected, consistent, patient-centred, evidence based, equitable) (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-3-1\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T3\">table 3</a>). We summarised the contributory domains and themes to provide definitions for high value and high-quality care. We produced a conceptual model to illustrate the relationship between domains and themes, alongside the key stakeholders in care provision found in the literature (<a id=\"xref-fig-1-1\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F1\">figure 1</a>).</p><p id=\"p-54\" class=\"first-child\">High value care conceptual model.

We determined that data was sufficiently saturated after the ninth interview. We received eight responses that suggested changes to the model.</p><p id=\"p-59\">Quotes from interviews and surveys can be found in <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-3\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental appendix 2</a>. Participants’ feedback led to two additional high-quality care themes (effective and accountable). The top three themes were noted by participants when asked what domains or themes were most important in clinical practice: patient-centred (23/26 (88%)), evidence based (15/26 (57%)), reducing waste (12/26 (46%)). We generated an additional definition for low value care, and 21 statements on application (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-4\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental appendix 2</a>).<a id=\"xref-ref-32-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32</a>\n",
       "</p><h3>Stage three: consensus meeting</h3><p id=\"p-60\">Overall, 16/31 (52%) of participants attended the consensus meeting. <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-5\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">Online supplemental appendix 3</a> lists full results of the consensus meeting. Two additional themes for high-quality care reached consensus (effective and accountable care, <a id=\"xref-table-wrap-3-2\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T3\">table 3</a>), which were incorporated into our definitions and conceptual model. Consensus was reached on the additional definition of low value care. Fifteen application statements reached consensus. No disagreements were raised when we provided meeting participants with an opportunity to provide written feedback on the summary report.</p><h3>Final output</h3><p id=\"p-61\">The process resulted in the following definitions from physiotherapists’ perspectives.</p><h4>High value care</h4><p id=\"p-62\">Care that delivers most value for the patient, and the clinical benefits outweigh the costs to the individual or system providing the care. Within high value care there are four contributing domains: high-quality care; patient values; cost-effectiveness; reducing waste (see <a id=\"xref-table-wrap-2-2\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T2\">table 2</a> for further explanation of domains).</p><h4>High-quality care</h4><p id=\"p-63\">Evidence based, effective and safe care that is patient-centred, consistent, accountable, timely, equitable and allows easy interaction with healthcare providers and healthcare systems (connected) (see <a id=\"xref-table-wrap-3-3\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T3\">table 3</a> for details).</p><h4>Low value care</h4><p id=\"p-64\">Care that is not patient-centred, or aligned with the patient’s goals, and is ineffective and/or unnecessary.</p><p id=\"p-65\">The process also produced a conceptual model in <a id=\"xref-fig-1-2\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F1\">figure 1</a> that links the definitions with the context of care and 15 statements related to application of the domains and themes in practice (<a id=\"xref-fig-2-1\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F2\">figure 2</a>).</p><p id=\"p-66\" class=\"first-child\">Consensus generated statements to assist the clinical application of high value care for musculoskeletal conditions.</p><h3>Areas of disagreement</h3><p id=\"p-67\">\n",
       "<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-6\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">Online supplemental appendix 3</a> lists areas of disagreement. Six statements did not reach consensus. Of these, three statements were included as accompanying explanatory text to domains and themes. The other three were not included in our definitions or model. Other areas of disagreement are discussed under research implications.</p><h2 class=\"\">Discussion</h2><p id=\"p-68\">Our study adds clinicians’ perspectives to the body of literature defining high value musculoskeletal care. For physiotherapists, high value care is care that is high quality, incorporates patient values, is cost-effective and reduces waste in the care cycle. High-quality care is safe, connected, consistent, patient-centred, evidence based, timely, equitable, effective and accountable. We provide statements from the clinical perspective to assist with the application of high value care.</p><h3>Strengths and limitations</h3><p id=\"p-69\">This study used RAND/UCLA methodology to reach consensus and established protocols a priori.<a id=\"xref-ref-30-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30–32</a> All stages of this study (from conception to manuscript writing) were coproduced with a research network of physiotherapists, who predominantly work in private practice, which improves the credibility of our findings. However, the perspectives included in this study are unlikely be representative of all physiotherapists; our study involved members of a research network who likely share similar views and biases regarding care value and a minority of participants were female.<a id=\"xref-ref-62-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-62\">62</a> In stage three, voting was not anonymous, and participant’s votes may have been influenced by other members. Four participants left the consensus meeting before statement 15 (on equitable care), because they had other commitments to attend. However, none of the members who left provided any disagreement with the statement on the report following the workshop.</p><h3>Relation to previous literature</h3><p id=\"p-70\">Our study suggests there is more to value for practising clinicians than previously documented. While there is alignment with many domains and themes described in existing literature, participants in our highlighted the importance of additional themes for effective and accountable care in defining high value care. Previous definitions of value have focused on the economic implications of care and encompass a ratio of cost relative to care outcomes.<a id=\"xref-ref-16-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-16\">16 51</a> Previous definitions also state that value can only be determined when the outcome of care is known.<a id=\"xref-ref-16-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-16\">16 51</a> While the importance of care outcomes is obvious, our study highlights that clinicians think value may be achieved through the consideration of multiple domains, themes and stakeholder perspectives. This suggests that, in the eyes of clinicians, care value is a continuum that can be shaped by the process of care.</p><h3>Clinical implications</h3><h4>Application of high value care: general information</h4><p id=\"p-71\">Participants perceived high value musculoskeletal care to be a process, existing on a continuum, involving as many domains and themes as possible. Participants felt that being aware of different stakeholders’ perspectives is integral to high value care. Our study suggests that high value care must balance these potentially conflicting perspectives and anchor care decisions on achieving the optimal outcome from the patient’s perspective.</p><h4>Domains of high value care</h4><p id=\"p-72\">Funding structures may incentivise care options that lead to low value care (<a id=\"xref-fig-2-2\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F2\">figure 2</a>). Most participants in our study work in the Australian private sector.<a id=\"xref-ref-63-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-63\">63</a> In this setting, a clinician can either see more patients per hour or reduce the costs to deliver care to maximise their income and ensure cost-effective delivery of care.<a id=\"xref-ref-64-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-64\">64–66</a> Both options typically mean the clinician spends less time with the patient, which makes high value care less likely. To apply high value care, clinicians should be aware of the levers that might lead to low value care.<a id=\"xref-ref-64-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-64\">64–67</a>\n",
       "</p><p id=\"p-73\">Removing unnecessary and wasteful care is a key contributor to high value care provision.<a id=\"xref-ref-12-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12 13</a> Research on reducing waste commonly focuses on removing unnecessary tests and procedures from practice in discrete care episodes.<a id=\"xref-ref-12-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12 13</a> Participants in our study expressed that a wider focus is important and reported additional wasteful elements like unnecessary referrals to other professionals. Participants also reported that it may be important to focus on clinical reasoning as a potential source of waste.</p><p id=\"p-74\">In reducing waste from care, it is also important to explcitly define low value care because clinicians can understand what to avoid and remove from practice. The idea of avoiding low value care within musculoskeletal practice has traction within the literature.<a id=\"xref-ref-68-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-68\">68 69</a> Low value care has been defined as care that provides little to no benefit to patients or where the risk of harm exceeds likely benefits.<a id=\"xref-ref-70-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-70\">70</a> The perspective gained in our study may assist in making the attempts at reducing waste more clinically applicable. A key component of low value care is a misalignment with both patient’s preferences and their goals (see statement 5).</p><p id=\"p-75\">A key goal of high value care is aligning care outcomes to the patient’s values and experience of health.<a id=\"xref-ref-16-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-16\">16 25 51</a> Patient values have been described as, ‘moral beliefs to which people appealed for the ultimate rationales of action’ (Spates <em>et al</em>,<a id=\"xref-ref-71-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-71\">71</a> pp 3) and reflect deep-seeded motivations for behaviour and life choices.<a id=\"xref-ref-71-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-71\">71</a> Values can dictate what a patient will find valuable about the care process and care outcomes.<a id=\"xref-ref-72-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-72\">72</a> There are tools that clinicians can employ to better align care with the patient’s values.<a id=\"xref-ref-73-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-73\">73 74</a> For example, patient-reported outcome measures, patient-reported experience measures and shared decision-making tools.<a id=\"xref-ref-73-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-73\">73 74</a> These tools, however, may not allow an in-depth understanding of patient’s values. Skilled communication is a key mechanism to uncover a patient’s values.<a id=\"xref-ref-61-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-61\">61</a> Communication should involve a two-way information exchange between patient and clinician so that both parties can learn from each other’s perspective and knowledge.<a id=\"xref-ref-61-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-61\">61</a> An in-depth information exchange may contribute positive effects to care<a id=\"xref-ref-75-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-75\">75</a> but may also create value for the patient by improving their ability to make decisions about their health.<a id=\"xref-ref-76-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-76\">76</a>\n",
       "</p><h4>Applying themes of high-quality care</h4><p id=\"p-76\">A requirement for high-quality care is safe care (care that does not cause patient harm).<a id=\"xref-ref-47-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-47\">47</a> Evidence on harms from treatment has focused on biomedical harms like side effects caused by medications.<a id=\"xref-ref-77-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-77\">77</a> While important, evidence suggests that a traditional biomedical view on harms may not capture other sources of potential harm in care provision.<a id=\"xref-ref-78-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-78\">78–83</a> For example, the language used when communicating a diagnosis or imaging findings alter treatment intentions and initiate a low value treatment cascade leading to harm.<a id=\"xref-ref-80-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-80\">80 81</a> In our study, participants agreed that they should look beyond commonly considered harms like medication side effects (statement 12).</p><p id=\"p-77\">Participants in our study reported clinicians should strive to deliver care that is accountable. Peer review and auditing of clinical practice has promise to improve care standards.<a id=\"xref-ref-84-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-84\">84–87</a> Clinicians in our study agreed that they should be open to having their practice and clinical reasoning reviewed by peers (statement 11). Discussing thought processes that lead to care decisions among peers may uncover flaws in reasoning and lead to improvements in care.<a id=\"xref-ref-84-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-84\">84–87</a> There is evidence demonstrating that clinicians may be reluctant to expose their practice to auditing,<a id=\"xref-ref-88-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-88\">88–90</a> which indicates that some aspects of practice auditing may take effort. However, critical appraisal of clinical reasoning and care decisions is low hanging fruit that individual clinicians can implement without significant change to practice.</p><h3>Research implications</h3><p id=\"p-78\">A key direction for future research is to incorporate other stakeholder perspectives. The patient’s perspective is central to high value care; the immediate next step for future research is to involve the patient’s voice to understand their perspective on receiving high value care. Additionally, other musculoskeletal clinicians and care stakeholders should be involved to understand their perspectives. Our definitions, themes and model can function as a framework to assist in establishing a common language to discuss the concept of high value care. Following this next step, we recommend future research aims to understand the barriers and facilitators to applying our domains and themes to support better high value care application.</p><p id=\"p-79\">Our results suggest that clinicians perceive there to be a conceptual difference between the methods a clinician can successfully use to deliver evidence-based care and the traditional description of evidence-based care.<a id=\"xref-ref-91-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-91\">91</a> However, dissenting opinion around the accompanying statements for effective care may allude to the group’s uncertainty about the specific content and application of effective care. Consensus was also low for statement 14 about evidence-based care (<a id=\"xref-fig-2-3\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F2\">figure 2</a>). Future research should determine whether other populations describe something like effective care (the skills and process of applying evidence-based care). Currently, we cannot rule out a persistent misunderstanding of the concept of Sackett’s original outline of evidence-based practice, which has been described elsewhere.<a id=\"xref-ref-90-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-90\">90–93</a>\n",
       "</p><p id=\"p-80\">Future research on equity in primary care and physiotherapy is needed. Participants in our study described that access to private practice physiotherapy is not equitable when patients cannot cover the difference between the clinician’s fee for service and government funding options. Evidence suggests inequitable access to physiotherapy is a concern both in Australia and internationally.<a id=\"xref-ref-94-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-94\">94 95</a> However, access to care is only one aspect of equity. Equity is a very broad concept and poorly defined in the literature.<a id=\"xref-ref-96-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-96\">96</a> Dissenting opinion on statement 15 about equitable care (<a id=\"xref-fig-2-4\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F2\">figure 2</a>) may point to a lack of common language and confusion about what equity means.<a id=\"xref-ref-96-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-96\">96</a> Researchers should first provide a common language about equity, so clinicians can consider it in their practice more often.<a id=\"xref-ref-97-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-97\">97</a>\n",
       "</p><h3>Policy implications</h3><p id=\"p-81\">Clinicians’ input is important for policy-makers because they experience first-hand the judgements and resources that contribute to successful patient outcomes. Policy-makers have placed importance on clinician-led efforts to generate consensus on what constitutes low value care.<a id=\"xref-ref-98-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-98\">98–100</a> Our study data provide a framework through which to establish specific recommendations about high value care. Policy-makers should work with clinicians and consumers to collaboratively establish targets to incentivise high value care, which would supplement the disincentives for low value care.</p><p id=\"p-82\">Policy-makers can also learn from the clinical perspective to understand systemic factors that make high value care difficult. Clinicians in our study felt that economic drivers in primary care can lead to low value care. Policy-makers could trial different funding mechanisms in collaboration with care providers to determine the effects on care provision. Clinicians in our study viewed that economic factors may also impact equitable access of physiotherapy. Policy-makers could consider alternate mechanisms to improve access to care.</p><h2 class=\"\">Conclusion</h2><p id=\"p-83\">This work highlights a clinical perspective on high value care for musculoskeletal conditions. Providing high value care was viewed by physiotherapists as a comprehensive construct that involves more than providing evidence-based care. High value care includes high-quality care (safe, connected, consistent, patient centred, evidence based, timely, equitable and accountable care), incorporates patient values, is cost-effective, and reduces waste.</p><h2 class=\"\">Data availability statement</h2><p id=\"p-92\">Data are available on reasonable request.

Australia, like many countries, has high levels of obesity and extreme climate events. The Reflexive Evidence and Systems interventions to Prevent Obesity and Non-communicable Disease (RESPOND) trial aims to prevent unhealthy weight gain in children in 10 intervention and two pilot communities in north-east Victoria, Australia using community-based participatory approaches informed by systems science. Intervention activities co-designed in 2019 were disrupted by COVID-19 and bushfires. This paper explores the impacts of these ‘shocks’ on the local prevention workforce to implement actions within communities.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>A case study design involving one-hour online focus groups and an on-line survey (November 2021-February 2022). Purposive sampling was used to achieve diverse representation from RESPOND stakeholders including local council, health services, primary care partnerships and department of health. The focus group interview schedule and survey questions were based on Durlak and DuPre’s implementation factors.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Twenty-nine participants from seven different communities participated in at least one of nine focus groups to discuss the impacts of COVID-19 and bushfires on localised implementation. Twenty-eight participants (97% of focus group sample) also completed the on-line survey. Implementation of RESPOND stalled or stopped in most communities due to bushfires and/or COVID-19. These shocks resulted in organisational priorities changing, loss of momentum for implementation, redeployment of human resources, culminating in fatigue and exhaustion. Participants reported adaptation of RESPOND, but implementation was slowed due to limited resources.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Further research is needed to advance risk management strategies and protect resources within health promotion. System shocks such as bushfires and COVID-19 are inevitable, and despite multiple adaptation opportunities, this intervention approach was not ‘shock proof’.</p><p><strong>Citation: </strong>Whelan J, Hillenaar M, Fraser P, Allender S, Jackson M, Strugnell C, et al.

The latest Cochrane review on childhood obesity prevention reported limited effectiveness of existing interventions and called for a systems approach to prevention, highlighting that interventions designed to target the complex drivers (e.g. multi-faceted and multi-level) of childhood obesity are likely to have the greatest impact [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. The recent Lancet Commission on Obesity (2019) expanded the application of their 2011 call for a systems approach [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>] to prevent obesity, to also prevent undernutrition and climate change [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>].</p><p>In Australia, the total annual area of land affected by fire has increased significantly over the past 32 years [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>], and in 2019 and 2020 Australia experienced fires in each of the six states and one of the two territories of Australia [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. Northeast Victoria was one of the areas largely impacted by the 2019/20 bushfires, with the emergence of COVID-19 shortly following [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. Varying degrees of public health orders were put into place, such as limitations on public gatherings (outdoor and indoor), closure of specified retail business types, working from home requirements, and limits to the physical distance people could travel from their homes [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. Secondly, there were specific health consequences directly related to COVID-19. To date (August 2022), Australia has reported over 10 million cases of COVID-19 and more than 14,200 reported deaths [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>]. Beyond the immediate disease, there were physical and mental health impacts on health workers [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>] and documented impacts on mental health across community members more generally [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>].</p><p>At the time that the 2019/20 bushfires and COVID-19 hit northeast Victoria, communities in this area were also participating in the Reflexive Evidence and Systems interventions to Prevent Obesity and Non-communicable Disease (RESPOND) research project. In 2018, the RESPOND trial commenced in the Goulburn Valley and Ovens Murray regions [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. RESPOND is a 5-year, stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia and partners. It was scheduled to operate across five local government areas (step 1) from 2018, another five local government areas (step 2) from 2020 (2 years after step 1), and was preceded by work within two pilot communities from 2016. RESPOND uses community-based participatory research informed by systems science to build capacity within community stakeholders [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>] who then co-design actions to prevent unhealthy weight gain and improve health-related quality of life in children aged 5–12 years. Co-design began with a series of three group model building (GMB) workshops [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>] to build a systems map capturing local drivers of childhood obesity and preventive actions [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>].</p><p>Project stakeholders commenced implementation of local prioritised actions from 2019. Examples of such actions included increasing healthy food access through shares and swaps, food literacy and education programs, increasing opportunities for physical activity through enhancements to public spaces and come and try events, and increased communications and promotion of opportunities. The implementation for most communities was interrupted by bushfires in November 2019. The fires were described as ‘unprecedented’ [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>], with 21% of Australia’s temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome burned (New South Wales and Victoria), compared with 2% typical of previous major fire years [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. All communities in RESPOND were impacted to varying degrees by these bushfires, most directly through active fires, or smoke pollution. All RESPOND communities saw the reallocation of stakeholders, such as health promotion and council officers, to emergency response roles, where they were required to support the bushfire recovery and/or Victoria’s COVID-19 response. In addition, these stakeholders along with their community members, were impacted by work disruptions, illness, and deaths associated with COVID-19.</p><p>Implementation of initiatives in real-world interventions is always challenging. The field of Implementation Science provides guidance to enhance this uptake of evidence into practice [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>], and has identified specific factors for consideration during this implementation phase [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. Implementation is likely to be even more challenging when communities are impacted by shocks such as bushfires and COVID-19. This manuscript explored the impact of bushfires and COVID-19 on the stakeholders’ ability to implement RESPOND. This manuscript addresses the research question: ‘what factors related to bushfires and COVID-19 impacted stakeholders’ ability to implement RESPOND as planned?’</p><h2>Methods</h2><h3>Design and theoretical frame</h3><p>A case study approach was used to gather information on the impacts of bushfires and COVID-19 on the implementation of a large, funded trial. Ethics approval was obtained from Deakin University HEAG_H 172_2018. We drew on Community-Based Systems Dynamics (CBSD) and Implementation Science frameworks. CBSD informed the co-design of the RESPOND interventions and gave us a process for identifying and managing complex and dynamic community determinants of children’s health. Implementation science, and the Durlak and Dupre [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>] framework in particular, guided the development of the survey and focus group questioning. Following this, the framework also informed the theming and identification of implementation factors. CBSD was again used for summarising themes.</p><h3>Context–The RESPOND intervention</h3><p>RESPOND is a community-led change initiative that focusses on creating healthier environments for children aged 0 to 12 years across 10 local government areas (approximately 30,000 children) in north-east Victoria, Australia. More detail is provided in the published protocol [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>].</p><h3>Research team and reflexivity</h3><p>Focus groups were conducted by Author 1 (PhD) as facilitator, with Author 2 (BHlthSc) as notetaker. Author 1 has specific training in qualitative methodologies. Author 2 has been involved in qualitative research previously. Author 1 was employed as a Postdoctoral Researcher and Author 2 as a Project Manager and Implementation Coach for RESPOND at the time of the research. Data collection and analysis was grounded in pragmatic epistemology. By adopting pragmatism, the researchers looked at understanding and addressing problems in a real- world context [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>], embracing the messiness of everyday life [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. Study insights were informed by team members’ understanding of the context, the broader RESPOND study, methodological experience, and field-based knowledge. Researcher perspectives were guided by the recent Lancet Commission on Obesity, community-based systems dynamics, and traditional health promotion frameworks such as the Ottawa Charter. At the time of conducting this research, all authors, except PF, had varying degrees of a pre-existing relationship with most participants through involvement with the RESPOND project. No other researchers or non-participants were present at the focus group sessions.</p><h3>Participants and recruitment</h3><p>Participants were recruited via email through existing networks from two pilot communities (City of Greater Shepparton and Moira Shire) and five Step 1 communities (Strathbogie Shire, Murrindindi Shire, Mansfield Shire, Indigo Shire and City of Wodonga). Purposive sampling was used to achieve participation from a range of stakeholders involved with implementing RESPOND in each community. Invited participants (hereafter participants) included staff (community development and health promotion) from local government, the health sector, primary care partnerships, state government departments of health and sporting organisations. Written consent was provided by each participant. Where this consent was not received prior to the focus group session, verbal consent was sought and audio recorded at the beginning of this session, and written consent was received prior to analysis.</p><h3>Data collection</h3><p>Data were collected from one-hour online focus groups and an on-line survey with RESPOND stakeholders (November 2021-February 2022). The focus group schedule (<a href=\"#pone.0287468.s001\">S1 File</a>) and survey (<a href=\"#pone.0287468.s002\">S2 File</a>) were based on implementation factors proposed by Durlak and DuPre [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>] and used to facilitate the discussion of the impacts of COVID-19 and bushfires (henceforth ‘shocks’) on the capacity of RESPOND stakeholders to implement intervention activities in communities. Durlak and DuPre [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>] reviewed and synthesised 542 implementation studies and identified five broad factors impacting implementation: community level factors (e.g., politics, funding); provider characteristics (e.g., perceived benefits of innovation); characteristics of the innovation (e.g., compatibility and adaptability); factors related to the prevention delivery system (e.g., work climate, shared decision making, leadership), and factors related to the prevention support system (e.g., training).</p><p>A focus group was scheduled for each of the Step 1 communities (n = 5) and one focus group for the pilot communities, to discuss the impact of the bushfires and COVID-19 on participants and the implementation of RESPOND. Additional focus groups (n = 3) were scheduled to accommodate requests to participate from people who had been invited but were unable to attend the initial sessions. Focus group transcripts were reviewed by authors 1 and 2 after each session. At the conclusion of the nine focus groups, authors 1 and 2 agreed that no new themes were emerging, and that data saturation was reached. Focus groups were audio and visual recorded using Zoom [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>], and transcribed verbatim. A notetaker (author 2) took notes during each focus group as a backup and for clarification (if required) of the online recording. Once de-identified, transcripts were returned to all participants for review and editing. No significant feedback from participants was received; only simple grammatical and de-identifying advice. The finalised transcripts were imported into NVivo [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>]. All identifiable information was securely stored via password protection on Author 2’s Deakin University computer system.</p><p>At the conclusion of the focus group, participants were invited to complete a 15-question on-line survey. Responses to the questions were recorded on a 5-point Likert scale—Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly Disagree. Results from the survey were exported to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and summarised. This survey’s purpose was to complement the qualitative data from the focus group questions.</p><h3>Data analysis</h3><p>Transcripts were themed to the implementation factors identified by Durlak and DuPre [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>] based on a codebook developed by authors 1 &amp; 3 (<a href=\"#pone.0287468.s003\">S1 Table</a>). An additional theme of ‘system shocks’ was added to capture the bushfire and COVID-19 events. Where aspects from the transcripts did not align with the framework, emergent themes were created. During the process of data analysis, the researchers most closely involved in data collection and analyses (Authors 1, 2 &amp; 3) met regularly to discuss coding to the framework and the emerging themes, clarify analysis and share reflections. At this stage, input was sought from other team members with experience in the RESPOND project (Authors 4, 5, 6 &amp; 7). De-identified quotes drawn from the thematic coding were used to illustrate themes. Summarised survey results were captured in a table, with each question grouped in to one of three themes. These themes were derived from the themes within the codebook (<a href=\"#pone.0287468.s003\">S1 Table</a>). After analysis of the focus groups and surveys, the inter-relationship between the factors impacting implementation were connected visually using STICKE software [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>]. This was done by Author 2 using CBSD principles and experience, and with support from systems science expert Andrew Brown. Connections were derived from the focus group discussions and were considered by all authors, to add value to the narrative and connections of the identified factors.</p><h2>Findings</h2><p>A total of 29 people participated in one of nine focus groups. One participant attended two focus groups as they were representing a different community in each and provided input for each community. Twenty-eight of these participants also completed the survey. All identified stakeholder groups were represented by at least one participant, with highest participation from the health sector (n = 19), followed by local government (n = 5), primary care partnerships (n = 4), state government (n = 1), and regional sports assemblies (n = 1). See <a href=\"#pone-0287468-t001\">Table 1</a>. All participants had been involved with RESPOND for at least two weeks, with most having been involved for the duration of the project to date (˜ 2 years). Preliminary findings were shared with participants through a regular network meeting and no significant feedback was provided.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.t001</a></p><h3>System shocks—bushfires and COVID-19</h3><p>Participants described responding to bushfires as routine because of previous bushfire responses.</p><p><em>‘…there’s a historical aspect to this</em>. <em>The northeast of…Victoria has … every three or four years have dealt with major bushfires to varying levels of… extremity I suppose’ (FG8</em>, <em>P1)</em></p><p>However, the shock of COVID-19 was considered overwhelming because it was in addition to the bushfire shock and it impacted many more people. The sentiment, as captured in the quotes below, was that communities had faced one thing after another, and they were tired and perhaps less likely to engage with RESPOND as a result.</p><p><em>‘…if it was just bushfires alone I can’t imagine that would have had much of an issue</em>, <em>but it was a knock on effect</em>, <em>that plus</em>, <em>then COVID being the real impact</em>.<em>’ (FG4</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p><em>‘…people were exhausted</em>. <em>They were fatigued</em>, <em>not just</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>first of all</em>, <em>they were fatigued from bushfires</em>, <em>but then they got to COVID and they were still fatigued from bushfires</em>, <em>and then COVID on top of it</em>.<em>’ (FG8</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><h3>Community level factors</h3><h4>Policy.</h4><p>Discussion of policy comprised two elements: firstly, there were elements of policy in terms of public health orders that limited, for example, stakeholder capacity to engage with community members in person; second, changes to state level health promotion guidelines were provided to local stakeholders for review during this period of COVID-19. The proposed changes had potential to impact the way stakeholders co-designed and prioritised their work. Participants reported concern of both the timing of this proposed policy change and the content which they interpreted as allowing less local context.</p><p>Regarding the proposed health promotion priorities to be funded, multiple participants expressed concern:</p><p><em>‘The big elephant in the room</em>, <em>which we all know about</em>, <em>is the [new policy] guidelines</em>. <em>Um</em>, <em>they really</em>, <em>yeah</em>, <em>hinder us in the way that they’re very prescriptive and there’s not a lot of space for other things to happen</em>.<em>’ (FG1</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><p>One participant noted that the policy guidelines could ‘future proof’ their work if they were aligned with community-led implementation:</p><p><em>‘… if it’s in a strategic plan</em>, <em>and there’s alignment</em>, <em>and it has to happen</em>, <em>the turnover of the people is probably not as critical as it is with the linkages</em>. <em>Because if it’s in a plan</em>, <em>it’s got to be delivered</em>, <em>they’re accountable for that</em>. <em>So</em>, <em>… then it gets handed over to the next person and becomes that critical piece of work</em>.<em>’ (FG8</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>Multiple participants reported transitioning, often with little warning, in and out of policy changes due to health orders responding to changing pandemic conditions (e.g. example community lockdowns). A consequence of this rapid change in policy priority meant practitioners were unable to plan with certainty any community engagement activities or implement the prioritised actions of RESPOND:</p><p><em>‘I think so much of the impact as well is</em>, <em>what I said earlier</em>, <em>the stop and start nature of this year</em>. <em>I think we never were able to get momentum</em>, <em>or feeling of what we could do</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>you’d have a few months of being able to go in person to see people and then we’re back in lockdown</em>, <em>we’re out of lockdown</em>. <em>It was too uncertain to plan and do things as well because it was so in and out this year</em>.<em>’ (FG4</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><p><em>‘…we’ve since lost it again because of COVID</em>. <em>So</em>, <em>this continuous issue around building that momentum through community engagement to get community- led response</em>, <em>there’s a massive barrier when disaster happens</em>.<em>’ (FG8</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>One focus group reported that after multiple efforts to restart an initiative, a decision was made to pause:</p><p>‘… we made the call as a team that we were going to stop at a point and just breathe and wait till we could get somewhat back together and go again, so we did that in May and of course we had another interruption, set of interruptions and everything since’ (FG5, P1)</p><h4>Funding.</h4><p>While the funding for RESPOND did not change in response to the bushfires and COVID-19, participants reported that the shocks stretched in-kind contributions:</p><p><em>‘Upon reflection of how RESPOND was originally meant to fit into our current work role</em>, <em>the initial 10% that was sort of deemed as our EFT [equivalent full time] within our funding agreement</em>, <em>the 10% wasn’t a realistic figure at all</em>. <em>We didn’t have any additional funding or additional staff to be able to do it’ (FG9</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>This reflection on inadequate resourcing was experienced by others, who reported:</p><p><em>‘…we didn’t have the resources</em>. <em>The amount of pre- preparation work prior to GMBs</em>, <em>the amount of work post GMBs</em>, <em>it was essentially</em>, <em>we had every single team member working on that</em>, <em>and doing the minimal amount of other programs as opposed to RESPOND</em>. <em>And it was very much</em>, <em>we piled in our EFT just for that…</em> … <em>So it was this ebb and flow of EFT to RESPOND</em>. <em>So</em>, <em>I don’t think we had enough resources and we’re identifying right now that we’ve got some staffing issues in [local area] and that we won’t have enough for this year</em>.<em>’ (FG8</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>One community presented a more optimistic view, saying that the creation and funding of a RESPOND position enhanced community resilience (see related theme) following the COVID-19 and bushfire shocks and, protected RESPOND funding for its intended purpose in the face of competing priorities:</p><p>‘… [referring to person funded in position] having that role, be really pushing forward and keeping the momentum going, was definitely the reason that we were able to have the success that we’ve had’ (FG7, P3)</p><p><em>‘…we had [referring to colleague] employed with hours…so</em>, <em>for at least a day a week…we could quarantine those hours to RESPOND…so I think that helped in not diverting (colleague) to something else that could have been COVID-related</em>.<em>’</em> (FG3, P1)</p><h3>Provider characteristics</h3><h4>Redeployment of resources (emergent theme–related to perceived need for innovation, self-efficacy and skill proficiency).</h4><p>Many participants reported that their organisations asked them to ‘pivot’ individual roles and responsibilities to <em>“bushfire recovery work”</em> (FG5, P1), <em>“testing”</em> and <em>“contact tracing”</em> (FG1, P3), and COVID-19-related <em>“communications”</em> (FG9, P2).</p><p>‘… COVID also took a lot of our EFT for quite a while, at least from our organisation because so many different responses we were involved in, so for a good year, both myself and my co-worker for about half our jobs were probably doing COVID response, if not more’ (FG4, P3)</p><p>This ‘pivot’ displaced health promotion work, including working on RESPOND.</p><p>‘COVID’s had a huge impact and especially on our facilitation team too because a lot of them, like, … myself was only one day a week, … I stopped doing prevention to just focus purely on COVID related work’ (FG7, P1)</p><p>They also reported a lack of clarity from their organisations in terms of what tasks they were required to perform and when:</p><p><em>‘…there was a long time when officially we weren’t in the COVID response</em>, <em>but we suddenly had to man the front door</em>, <em>do screenings and stuff like that</em>, <em>and so it was a lot of unofficial “we just need bodies and we need hands to help as well”</em>, <em>so there was a bit of giving in that way</em>. <em>It’s only in the last six to nine months it’s really become a much more official allocation of roles and workload</em>. <em>Prior to that</em>, <em>it was just grab as needed</em>.<em>’ (FG4</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><p>In other organisations, the impact of redeployment was not as pronounced, but time available for health promotion was still impacted because of physical distancing requirements and ‘work-from-home’ advice:</p><p><em>‘…that’s not really been the cause of our lack of work in the RESPOND space</em>, <em>it’s more about that community engagement and that lack of ability to engage in a normal</em>, <em>in inverted commas</em>, <em>way</em>, <em>yeah so it’s not been a lack of staff</em>, <em>it’s more been about a lack of ability to get out and about and do the things in the way that we usually do</em>, <em>do things</em>.<em>’ (FG4</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><h3>Characteristics of the innovation</h3><h4>Compatibility (contextual appropriateness, fit, congruence, match).</h4><p>A key finding was that participants reported community priorities being pushed away from the objectives of RESPOND and towards managing COVID-19:</p><p><em>‘…there was a lot of momentum and there was a lot of people that were passionate about the project and willing to be a part of it</em>, <em>… that have just been pulled other places and that have other priorities like we all have throughout COVID</em>. <em>And</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>this [RESPOND] has been put on the backburner a bit’ (FG7</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>Participants described how the shocks made some priorities more urgent than others. Children’s healthy eating and physical activity was less of a priority due to COVID-19 despite the planning, agreements, partnerships and commitments that were in place. Instead, the emphasis was on mental health:</p><p><em>‘All of our Planned stuff has been put on the back burner to deal with COVID requirements… and majority of our conversations with our stakeholders has been around mental health</em>.<em>’ (FG6</em>, <em>P1)</em></p><h4>Adaptability (program modification, reinvention).</h4><p>Participants reported that adapting to COVID-19 made delivery of RESPOND harder because of requirements to work from home and to physically distance. This meant that meetings could not be face- to- face. Moving online was initially seen as a positive because it opened the possibility of engaging with people who had previously been difficult to reach, such as those living out of town. This did not eventuate for RESPOND however:</p><p><em>‘…you have to have some really committed people for them to actually be able to travel to do face-to-face</em>. <em>So I initially thought “Oh</em>, <em>this is going to be great</em>, <em>get lots of people from across the [local government area]” [into a virtual platform]</em>, <em>but we’ve actually really struggled to engage more broadly across the [local government area]’ (FG9</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>Participants described engaging with community members online as a poorer quality of engagement compared to face- to- face, and said it impacted their ability to deliver RESPOND.</p><p><em>‘…through COVID</em>, <em>one of the biggest things was that there is this new expectation around agility</em>, <em>and that adaptability</em>, <em>… and using digital engagement to actually get things done</em>, <em>but the thing is</em>, <em>there’s a difference between digital engagement and community engagement</em>, <em>they’re very different things</em>, <em>and you cannot necessarily do community engagement digitally</em>. <em>And we had very poor uptake when we tried to flip it</em>.<em>’ (FG8</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>This online shift may have particularly impacted RESPOND because initial community engagement was face- to- face and cumulative, enabling multiple formal and informal discussions that some participants felt did not transfer well to the online environment.</p><p>‘… because RESPOND was built on, especially here, a face-to-face model, you know, to take that offline, that’s just not realistic really,’ (FG5, P1)</p><p>‘… it’s all well and good to try to take things online, but is it actually having the same impact that we want it to have? Is it having the same meaning? Are we actually still reaching the purpose of the project in the first place by going online?’ (FG6, P6)</p><p>One participant outlined reasons they considered online engagement inferior:</p><p><em>‘I felt like with the group of people and it’s</em>, <em>it happens with all online things…people become hesitant to interrupt</em>, <em>… you don’t have those organic natural conversations</em>, <em>… I just feel like online you do miss out on some of the body language or cues or people that may want to say something but are too scared to interrupt online</em>.<em>’ (FG9</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><p>Conversely, one community reported that the move to online engagement wasn’t detrimental because of the foundation that was built prior to the first experience of lockdowns:</p><p>‘<em>so we did</em>, <em>obviously did all of our’s [referring to GMBs] just prior to the bushfires</em>. <em>So</em>, <em>which was probably really good for [our community]…</em>.<em>we had our group of interested community people</em>, <em>and then the other thing that did happen is that we offered our first lot of face- to- face interviews from our groups after bushfires</em>, <em>which was sort of end January pre- entering any form of COVID restrictions</em>, <em>so we did meet</em>, <em>we got one meeting with each of our groups… which I think</em>, <em>then</em>, <em>when we then had to go to online meetings</em>, <em>we had some really good ideas that had come out of those focus groups</em>, <em>as well as the meeting</em>, <em>to start to move forward to get some runs on the board</em>.<em>’ (FG3</em>, <em>P1)</em></p><h3>Factors relevant to the prevention delivery system: Organisational capacity</h3><h4>Integration of new work (extent to which an organisation can incorporate an innovation in its existing practices).</h4><p>Schools transitioning to remote learning and the restriction of early childhood services to essential workers (e.g., health care staff, police), pushed RESPOND activities further aside:</p><p><em>‘…unfortunately</em>, <em>by February when everybody was sort of back on board and raring to go</em>, <em>a lot of actions were either in community or working with settings such as schools</em>, <em>early years services</em>, <em>maternal child health nurse</em>, <em>health services that just were bombarded when it came to COVID</em>.<em>’ (FG7</em>, <em>P1)</em></p><p><em>‘it’s been hard to get into</em>, <em>get involved with our stakeholders</em>, <em>especially schools because they’ve been so busy and impacted</em>.<em>’ (FG6</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><h4>Shared decision making (local input, community participation or involvement, local ownership collaboration).</h4><p>Participants described both bushfires and COVID-19 severely hampering their ability to undertake community participation activities, to build local ownership of RESPOND, and strengthen collaborations as originally intended.</p><p>‘… there’s being really minimal contact from, like between us and the community, just because of yep bushfires, COVID …’ (FG1, P3)</p><p>‘… as with probably everybody, COVID hit and yeah the wheels fell off effectively……We still have been doing little bits and pieces in this space but yeah, certainly not anything to the scale of where we were hoping to get to after that last GMB with that great engagement’ (FG4, P2)</p><p>This was particularly true in schools that would normally be a core partner in health promotion activities.</p><p><em>‘… it’s been hard to get into</em>, <em>get involved with our stakeholders</em>, <em>especially schools because they’ve been so busy and impacted</em>.<em>’ (FG6</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><h4>Leadership and champions.</h4><p>Participants described previous experiences of bushfires, where local ‘champions’ had agreed to lead community prevention work but were pulled away to the urgent tasks of bushfire recovery. They expressed frustration that this had occurred again and that they were still vulnerable to shocks.</p><p>‘… we get stuck in these cycles where we’ll have a bushfire, and that impacts on everyone’s ability because you get staff burnout, you get people that you know, like I said, just have to concentrate on themselves and their own issues and they can’t, you know, be champions’ (FG7, P1)</p><p><em>‘Our key backbone group that we were going to utilise and lean on a lot was going to be our Rotary Club</em>, <em>and then our Rotary Club did go [and] give assistance to the bushfire area because (referring to local community) was obviously quite close to some of the other areas impacted</em>. <em>So we sort of lost a bit of engagement with them…’ (FG4</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><p>Participants noted that leadership changes are exaggerated in rural communities compared to metropolitan communities because leaders have multiple roles:</p><p><em>‘… because of the fact that we had community members there that wore so many hats…</em>.<em>Going into bushfires</em>, <em>… they were also involved in the CFA and so you know had no time to deal with all of the RESPOND stuff’ (FG1</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><h4>Fatigue (emergent theme).</h4><p>Many comments were made by participants regarding the uncertainty and exhaustion that both staff and community felt resulting from bushfires and COVID-19:</p><p>‘Within the community and their capacity, I think everybody is just exhausted from the past two years and they’re really struggling to take on anything extra’ (FG4, P1)</p><p><em>‘They were so sick of Zoom</em>. <em>They were so sick of cancelling</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>the emotional attachment and the financial attachment to set things up and cancel</em>. <em>In the end there’s been a lot of “Can we just wait ‘til this is over</em>?<em>”‘ (FG6</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>Participants also described fatigue in community stakeholders, particularly schools.</p><p><em>‘…it’s also the pushback from community</em>, <em>especially at the moment people are still getting back on their feet</em>. <em>Schools are still trying to get kids back in classrooms</em>.<em>’ (FG1</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><h4>Resilience and re-engagement <em>(emergent theme)</em>.</h4><p>Aware that original actions needed to be reviewed, several RESPOND community facilitators sought to re-engage their communities to re-prioritise and potentially identify new priorities. The quotes below demonstrate an understanding of the need to reassess community needs and re-engage with them. Evidence was seen of resilience and commitment of facilitators:</p><p><em>‘I think it’s almost more important now than ever to be getting that community’s perspective of what they need</em>, <em>because it’s so varied</em>, <em>even within the one LGA (local government area) it’s quite varied what our little towns need in regard to support and yeah</em>, <em>their requirements</em>, <em>so I think it’s more important now than it was before</em>.<em>’ (FG6</em>, <em>P1)</em></p><p>There was also evidence of community facilitators being aware of the need to honour people’s initial engagement and provide them with re-engagement opportunities. The questions posed in the below quote indicate strategies for adaptation to the new landscape the community were facing. They also demonstrate an understanding for the importance of planning to ensure actions could be operationalised:</p><p><em>‘the people that we have engaged</em>, <em>I think it’s really important to go back and give them the opportunity to revisit what those actions were</em>. <em>What is now going to work in our community</em>? <em>Who’s involved</em>? <em>Are there new leaders</em>? <em>Are there new people who are influencing people within the community</em>?<em>’ (FG9</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><h3>Factors related to the prevention support system</h3><p>In terms of the training needs of our participants, most acknowledged they had the skills required to undertake their roles. Participants reported resilience and an ongoing commitment to the health of local children and community wellbeing. What was less clear, was how to engage and successfully deliver a version of RESPOND in the wake of these system shocks.</p><p><em>‘I think COVID has</em>, <em>and that break and bushfires</em>, <em>has put everyone’s energy into a different space</em>. <em>And I think it was really important for us to do part two [revisit priorities for RESPOND] for our community to say this space is actually really</em>, <em>really important despite COVID</em>, <em>or alongside COVID</em>, <em>healthy eating/ physical activity is really important for our health</em>, <em>to keep ourselves healthy during that time of the pandemic as well</em>.<em>’ (FG9</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>‘<em>all of the way we look at the world and work and how we operate has had to shift</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>… what we thought might happen or what we thought might be possible</em>, <em>and what we could do</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>all had to get thrown out the window and to re- look at what does this mean…’ (FG2</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>In reflecting on the application of their skills in the use of community-based system dynamics, participants reflected that they were able to implement such work, develop a shared understanding of the issues, and commit to moving forward. Participants also reflected on the skills and shared values inherent in their rural communities:</p><p><em>‘…it’s easy-ish to identify lots of shared values</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>working together because we’ve got lots of shared values and I think</em>, <em>I don’t know</em>, <em>that felt to me like it was highlighted in COVID a bit</em>. <em>Like</em>, <em>there’s a</em>, <em>community looking after community</em>, <em>community caring about each other’s wellbeing</em>. <em>For example</em>, <em>our local supermarket… bought a van</em>, <em>so it started home delivery during COVID</em>, <em>… you know</em>, <em>there were people on Facebook</em>, <em>on the noticeboard saying</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>“I’m going shopping if anyone wants anything”‘ (FG6</em>, <em>P4)</em></p><p>These qualitative findings are expanded through the inclusion of the survey data, that provided more detail to some of the themes.</p><h3>Survey</h3><p>The majority of the 28 participants in the survey agreed/strongly agreed that their workplace considered RESPOND relevant to local needs (75%), was committed to the shared vision of RESPOND (89%), and that RESPOND was adaptable to the needs of their workplace (72%) (<a href=\"#pone-0287468-t002\">Table 2</a>). They also agreed/strongly agreed that strong community partnerships existed (78%). However, only 29% agreed/strongly agreed that their organisation had enough funding or could reorientate funding towards RESPOND, and only 36% agreed/strongly agreed that they had clear roles and responsibilities within RESPOND. Regarding political support, support from local political figures was high (67%), but support from state level politics was less clear at 47% of participants who agreed/strongly agreed that state policy supports the approach of RESPOND. See <a href=\"#pone-0287468-t002\">Table 2</a>.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.t002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.t002</a></p><p><a href=\"#pone-0287468-g001\">Fig 1</a> demonstrates the use of CBSD to analyse the factors revealed in this study interacting with bushfires and COVID-19. The colours identify the five Durlak and DuPre factors which are listed in the legend. A solid arrow between two factors demonstrates a relationship travelling in the same direction ie: as ‘shocks in the system’ increase, ‘fatigue’ also increases. Likewise, ‘as shocks in the system’ decrease, ‘fatigue’ also decreases. A dotted arrow indicates that there is a relationship travelling in opposite direction ie: as ‘fatigue’ increases, ‘engagement’ decreases, and as ‘fatigue’ decreases, ‘engagement’ increases. There are some examples in this figure which demonstrate a feedback loop, which recognises that some factors can get caught in a cycle ie: As ‘fatigue’ increases, ‘engagement’ decreases, which also decreases ‘momentum’. This study found that with a decrease in ‘momentum’, ‘fatigue’ was in fact increased, which was seen with the stop-start nature of COVID restrictions.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.g001</a></p><h2>Discussion</h2><h3>Main findings</h3><p>The implementation of a large, community-based trial to prevent childhood obesity in regional Victoria, Australia was heavily impacted by COVID-19 and further compounded by bushfires. Key factors associated, included the impact of unexpected funding and policy changes within communities and at the provider level, staff churn, redeployment to engage with the COVID response, limitations of working in online environments, changing priorities for leaders, and fatigue across all levels due to the intensity of the COVID response. Even with these shocks, participants also reported resilience, adaptability and an ongoing commitment to the goal of RESPOND in improving the health and wellbeing of children.</p><h3>Comparison to literature</h3><p>High redeployment levels of health promotion and community development staff to address COVID-19 has been observed across health sectors in Australia and internationally. Studies have reported similar impacts in low and middle-income countries, though perhaps even deeper where there was a rapid reduction in basic maternal, neonatal and child health services, indicating limited resilience within health systems [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>]. Other studies report the finding here that community health workers were mobilised to assist with the COVID-19 response [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>] and these roles changed rapidly, often without clear guidance or training. The impact of this redeployment and re-prioritisation has been variously described as affected [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>], compromised [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>], eroded [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>] and stressed [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>].</p><p>The re-deployment of existing staff to assist with the pandemic meant that multiple core roles were left unattended. While specific efforts were made to ensure RESPOND took an adaptive and reflexive approach [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>], the size of the shock meant human resources were removed from their core roles and RESPOND work was paused until COVID passed, meaning momentum was stymied.</p><p>While staff priorities shifted, so did that of the community. It was reported that many community members were not able to prioritise the work of RESPOND as they were being pulled in other directions and began to have more focus on addressing the mental health impacts of these shocks on communities. COVID-19 has been reported to increase psychological distress, and adversely impact mental and physical health among others [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>].</p><p>This study provided a reminder that active steps need to be taken by health promoters to generate and sustain political will for prevention [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>], or community-based innovations like RESPOND may be inadequately resourced to maintain core business in the face of system shocks, as was the case in Queensland from 1984 to 2014 [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>].</p><p>In this study, online engagement was reported as being less effective and less appropriate than in-person community engagement. These findings contrast with other studies, which found participants benefitting from online engagement and a broader representation of communities reached [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>] Given the growth in digital health technologies and potential of online technologies to reach marginalised community members, this is an area that warrants further research.</p><p>Inadequate resourcing of health promotion work has been a long- standing issue [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>], and these findings suggest that this was amplified by the disruptions of bushfires and COVID-19 in Northeast Victoria. Consistent with findings of the thematic analysis by Kavanagh et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>] who interviewed policy and program administrators in public health, and local community workers and volunteers in Tasmania, Australia, this study identified the importance of valuing people as a resource, respecting relationships both with community and organisations, and having adequate funding. The importance of soft infrastructure, such as relationships and networks were identified, both by Kavanagh [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>] and in this study. It was also identified, that the stronger the soft infrastructure in combination with adequate resources, the more likely those communities were able to cope with shocks, as seen by one RESPOND community.</p><h3>Strengths and weaknesses</h3><p>This is one of only a handful of studies to explore the impact of external shocks to intervention delivery. Participants were experienced practitioners directly involved in the delivery and support of health promotion. Qualitative, quantitative and systems science (CBSD) methods were used to analyse the results. The lack of varied characteristics of participants was one limitation of the research. School representatives were missing from this study, and due to significant staff turnover in the community health and community development workforce over this period, there were many people involved with RESPOND who had changed employment. Two participants who were no longer engaged with RESPOND still shared their insights within the focus groups.</p><p>Interpretation of any focus group data is subject to personal bias and in the case of this research, pragmatism, where the researchers were looking for the practical consequences of the bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic. It is possible that with this pragmatic lens, some nuance is lost.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Populations would benefit from a better funded and more prominent health promotion workforce that could focus on their role in implementing funded trials and preventing disease longer term. Health policy support that prioritises prevention could assist this. Without fundamental changes to policy and funding, health promotion practice is always at risk of the next ‘shock’ where resources will again be ‘re-deployed’ and their core skills undervalued. Research should include adaptive methods rather than be prescribed, so that work can continue when shocks occur.</p><p>Future research should explore additional methods that acknowledge complexity when working with shocks and how to track these shocks in real time. Additional resources required in health promotion roles needs to be identified to ensure that even when pivoting is necessary, core business can continue. The next step for this research is to reflect on what stakeholders consider could ‘shockproof’ their work.</p><p>Bushfires and COVID-19 provide an ongoing opportunity to learn how to harness prevention work and funded trials though adaptation and efficient resource allocation. This study identified that health promotion expertise was seen as ‘flexible’, rather than essential to the core business of prevention. When ‘shocks’ occur, the implementation of preventative approaches like RESPOND are reduced in priority to enable a crisis response.</p><h2>Supporting information</h2><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s001\">S1 File. </a>Focus group script.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s001\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s001</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(PDF)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s002\">S2 File. </a>Survey questions.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s002\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s002</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(PDF)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s003\">S1 Table. </a>Theme codebook.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s003\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s003</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(PDF)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s004\">S2 Table. </a>Completed COREQ checklist.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s004\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s004</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(PDF)</p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>The authors express gratitude to Mr Andrew Brown for assistance in developing <a href=\"#pone-0287468-g001\">Fig 1</a> and sourcing references.

Australia, like many countries, has high levels of obesity and extreme climate events. The Reflexive Evidence and Systems interventions to Prevent Obesity and Non-communicable Disease (RESPOND) trial aims to prevent unhealthy weight gain in children in 10 intervention and two pilot communities in north-east Victoria, Australia using community-based participatory approaches informed by systems science. Intervention activities co-designed in 2019 were disrupted by COVID-19 and bushfires. This paper explores the impacts of these ‘shocks’ on the local prevention workforce to implement actions within communities.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>A case study design involving one-hour online focus groups and an on-line survey (November 2021-February 2022). Purposive sampling was used to achieve diverse representation from RESPOND stakeholders including local council, health services, primary care partnerships and department of health. The focus group interview schedule and survey questions were based on Durlak and DuPre’s implementation factors.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Twenty-nine participants from seven different communities participated in at least one of nine focus groups to discuss the impacts of COVID-19 and bushfires on localised implementation. Twenty-eight participants (97% of focus group sample) also completed the on-line survey. Implementation of RESPOND stalled or stopped in most communities due to bushfires and/or COVID-19. These shocks resulted in organisational priorities changing, loss of momentum for implementation, redeployment of human resources, culminating in fatigue and exhaustion. Participants reported adaptation of RESPOND, but implementation was slowed due to limited resources.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Further research is needed to advance risk management strategies and protect resources within health promotion. System shocks such as bushfires and COVID-19 are inevitable, and despite multiple adaptation opportunities, this intervention approach was not ‘shock proof’.</p><p><strong>Citation: </strong>Whelan J, Hillenaar M, Fraser P, Allender S, Jackson M, Strugnell C, et al.

The latest Cochrane review on childhood obesity prevention reported limited effectiveness of existing interventions and called for a systems approach to prevention, highlighting that interventions designed to target the complex drivers (e.g. multi-faceted and multi-level) of childhood obesity are likely to have the greatest impact [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. The recent Lancet Commission on Obesity (2019) expanded the application of their 2011 call for a systems approach [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>] to prevent obesity, to also prevent undernutrition and climate change [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>].</p><p>In Australia, the total annual area of land affected by fire has increased significantly over the past 32 years [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>], and in 2019 and 2020 Australia experienced fires in each of the six states and one of the two territories of Australia [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. Northeast Victoria was one of the areas largely impacted by the 2019/20 bushfires, with the emergence of COVID-19 shortly following [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. Varying degrees of public health orders were put into place, such as limitations on public gatherings (outdoor and indoor), closure of specified retail business types, working from home requirements, and limits to the physical distance people could travel from their homes [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. Secondly, there were specific health consequences directly related to COVID-19. To date (August 2022), Australia has reported over 10 million cases of COVID-19 and more than 14,200 reported deaths [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>]. Beyond the immediate disease, there were physical and mental health impacts on health workers [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>] and documented impacts on mental health across community members more generally [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>].</p><p>At the time that the 2019/20 bushfires and COVID-19 hit northeast Victoria, communities in this area were also participating in the Reflexive Evidence and Systems interventions to Prevent Obesity and Non-communicable Disease (RESPOND) research project. In 2018, the RESPOND trial commenced in the Goulburn Valley and Ovens Murray regions [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. RESPOND is a 5-year, stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia and partners. It was scheduled to operate across five local government areas (step 1) from 2018, another five local government areas (step 2) from 2020 (2 years after step 1), and was preceded by work within two pilot communities from 2016. RESPOND uses community-based participatory research informed by systems science to build capacity within community stakeholders [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>] who then co-design actions to prevent unhealthy weight gain and improve health-related quality of life in children aged 5–12 years. Co-design began with a series of three group model building (GMB) workshops [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>] to build a systems map capturing local drivers of childhood obesity and preventive actions [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>].</p><p>Project stakeholders commenced implementation of local prioritised actions from 2019. Examples of such actions included increasing healthy food access through shares and swaps, food literacy and education programs, increasing opportunities for physical activity through enhancements to public spaces and come and try events, and increased communications and promotion of opportunities. The implementation for most communities was interrupted by bushfires in November 2019. The fires were described as ‘unprecedented’ [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>], with 21% of Australia’s temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome burned (New South Wales and Victoria), compared with 2% typical of previous major fire years [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. All communities in RESPOND were impacted to varying degrees by these bushfires, most directly through active fires, or smoke pollution. All RESPOND communities saw the reallocation of stakeholders, such as health promotion and council officers, to emergency response roles, where they were required to support the bushfire recovery and/or Victoria’s COVID-19 response. In addition, these stakeholders along with their community members, were impacted by work disruptions, illness, and deaths associated with COVID-19.</p><p>Implementation of initiatives in real-world interventions is always challenging. The field of Implementation Science provides guidance to enhance this uptake of evidence into practice [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>], and has identified specific factors for consideration during this implementation phase [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. Implementation is likely to be even more challenging when communities are impacted by shocks such as bushfires and COVID-19. This manuscript explored the impact of bushfires and COVID-19 on the stakeholders’ ability to implement RESPOND. This manuscript addresses the research question: ‘what factors related to bushfires and COVID-19 impacted stakeholders’ ability to implement RESPOND as planned?’</p><h2>Methods</h2><h3>Design and theoretical frame</h3><p>A case study approach was used to gather information on the impacts of bushfires and COVID-19 on the implementation of a large, funded trial. Ethics approval was obtained from Deakin University HEAG_H 172_2018. We drew on Community-Based Systems Dynamics (CBSD) and Implementation Science frameworks. CBSD informed the co-design of the RESPOND interventions and gave us a process for identifying and managing complex and dynamic community determinants of children’s health. Implementation science, and the Durlak and Dupre [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>] framework in particular, guided the development of the survey and focus group questioning. Following this, the framework also informed the theming and identification of implementation factors. CBSD was again used for summarising themes.</p><h3>Context–The RESPOND intervention</h3><p>RESPOND is a community-led change initiative that focusses on creating healthier environments for children aged 0 to 12 years across 10 local government areas (approximately 30,000 children) in north-east Victoria, Australia. More detail is provided in the published protocol [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>].</p><h3>Research team and reflexivity</h3><p>Focus groups were conducted by Author 1 (PhD) as facilitator, with Author 2 (BHlthSc) as notetaker. Author 1 has specific training in qualitative methodologies. Author 2 has been involved in qualitative research previously. Author 1 was employed as a Postdoctoral Researcher and Author 2 as a Project Manager and Implementation Coach for RESPOND at the time of the research. Data collection and analysis was grounded in pragmatic epistemology. By adopting pragmatism, the researchers looked at understanding and addressing problems in a real- world context [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>], embracing the messiness of everyday life [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. Study insights were informed by team members’ understanding of the context, the broader RESPOND study, methodological experience, and field-based knowledge. Researcher perspectives were guided by the recent Lancet Commission on Obesity, community-based systems dynamics, and traditional health promotion frameworks such as the Ottawa Charter. At the time of conducting this research, all authors, except PF, had varying degrees of a pre-existing relationship with most participants through involvement with the RESPOND project. No other researchers or non-participants were present at the focus group sessions.</p><h3>Participants and recruitment</h3><p>Participants were recruited via email through existing networks from two pilot communities (City of Greater Shepparton and Moira Shire) and five Step 1 communities (Strathbogie Shire, Murrindindi Shire, Mansfield Shire, Indigo Shire and City of Wodonga). Purposive sampling was used to achieve participation from a range of stakeholders involved with implementing RESPOND in each community. Invited participants (hereafter participants) included staff (community development and health promotion) from local government, the health sector, primary care partnerships, state government departments of health and sporting organisations. Written consent was provided by each participant. Where this consent was not received prior to the focus group session, verbal consent was sought and audio recorded at the beginning of this session, and written consent was received prior to analysis.</p><h3>Data collection</h3><p>Data were collected from one-hour online focus groups and an on-line survey with RESPOND stakeholders (November 2021-February 2022). The focus group schedule (<a href=\"#pone.0287468.s001\">S1 File</a>) and survey (<a href=\"#pone.0287468.s002\">S2 File</a>) were based on implementation factors proposed by Durlak and DuPre [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>] and used to facilitate the discussion of the impacts of COVID-19 and bushfires (henceforth ‘shocks’) on the capacity of RESPOND stakeholders to implement intervention activities in communities. Durlak and DuPre [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>] reviewed and synthesised 542 implementation studies and identified five broad factors impacting implementation: community level factors (e.g., politics, funding); provider characteristics (e.g., perceived benefits of innovation); characteristics of the innovation (e.g., compatibility and adaptability); factors related to the prevention delivery system (e.g., work climate, shared decision making, leadership), and factors related to the prevention support system (e.g., training).</p><p>A focus group was scheduled for each of the Step 1 communities (n = 5) and one focus group for the pilot communities, to discuss the impact of the bushfires and COVID-19 on participants and the implementation of RESPOND. Additional focus groups (n = 3) were scheduled to accommodate requests to participate from people who had been invited but were unable to attend the initial sessions. Focus group transcripts were reviewed by authors 1 and 2 after each session. At the conclusion of the nine focus groups, authors 1 and 2 agreed that no new themes were emerging, and that data saturation was reached. Focus groups were audio and visual recorded using Zoom [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>], and transcribed verbatim. A notetaker (author 2) took notes during each focus group as a backup and for clarification (if required) of the online recording. Once de-identified, transcripts were returned to all participants for review and editing. No significant feedback from participants was received; only simple grammatical and de-identifying advice. The finalised transcripts were imported into NVivo [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>]. All identifiable information was securely stored via password protection on Author 2’s Deakin University computer system.</p><p>At the conclusion of the focus group, participants were invited to complete a 15-question on-line survey. Responses to the questions were recorded on a 5-point Likert scale—Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly Disagree. Results from the survey were exported to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and summarised. This survey’s purpose was to complement the qualitative data from the focus group questions.</p><h3>Data analysis</h3><p>Transcripts were themed to the implementation factors identified by Durlak and DuPre [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>] based on a codebook developed by authors 1 &amp; 3 (<a href=\"#pone.0287468.s003\">S1 Table</a>). An additional theme of ‘system shocks’ was added to capture the bushfire and COVID-19 events. Where aspects from the transcripts did not align with the framework, emergent themes were created. During the process of data analysis, the researchers most closely involved in data collection and analyses (Authors 1, 2 &amp; 3) met regularly to discuss coding to the framework and the emerging themes, clarify analysis and share reflections. At this stage, input was sought from other team members with experience in the RESPOND project (Authors 4, 5, 6 &amp; 7). De-identified quotes drawn from the thematic coding were used to illustrate themes. Summarised survey results were captured in a table, with each question grouped in to one of three themes. These themes were derived from the themes within the codebook (<a href=\"#pone.0287468.s003\">S1 Table</a>). After analysis of the focus groups and surveys, the inter-relationship between the factors impacting implementation were connected visually using STICKE software [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>]. This was done by Author 2 using CBSD principles and experience, and with support from systems science expert Andrew Brown. Connections were derived from the focus group discussions and were considered by all authors, to add value to the narrative and connections of the identified factors.</p><h2>Findings</h2><p>A total of 29 people participated in one of nine focus groups. One participant attended two focus groups as they were representing a different community in each and provided input for each community. Twenty-eight of these participants also completed the survey. All identified stakeholder groups were represented by at least one participant, with highest participation from the health sector (n = 19), followed by local government (n = 5), primary care partnerships (n = 4), state government (n = 1), and regional sports assemblies (n = 1). See <a href=\"#pone-0287468-t001\">Table 1</a>. All participants had been involved with RESPOND for at least two weeks, with most having been involved for the duration of the project to date (˜ 2 years). Preliminary findings were shared with participants through a regular network meeting and no significant feedback was provided.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.t001</a></p><h3>System shocks—bushfires and COVID-19</h3><p>Participants described responding to bushfires as routine because of previous bushfire responses.</p><p><em>‘…there’s a historical aspect to this</em>. <em>The northeast of…Victoria has … every three or four years have dealt with major bushfires to varying levels of… extremity I suppose’ (FG8</em>, <em>P1)</em></p><p>However, the shock of COVID-19 was considered overwhelming because it was in addition to the bushfire shock and it impacted many more people. The sentiment, as captured in the quotes below, was that communities had faced one thing after another, and they were tired and perhaps less likely to engage with RESPOND as a result.</p><p><em>‘…if it was just bushfires alone I can’t imagine that would have had much of an issue</em>, <em>but it was a knock on effect</em>, <em>that plus</em>, <em>then COVID being the real impact</em>.<em>’ (FG4</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p><em>‘…people were exhausted</em>. <em>They were fatigued</em>, <em>not just</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>first of all</em>, <em>they were fatigued from bushfires</em>, <em>but then they got to COVID and they were still fatigued from bushfires</em>, <em>and then COVID on top of it</em>.<em>’ (FG8</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><h3>Community level factors</h3><h4>Policy.</h4><p>Discussion of policy comprised two elements: firstly, there were elements of policy in terms of public health orders that limited, for example, stakeholder capacity to engage with community members in person; second, changes to state level health promotion guidelines were provided to local stakeholders for review during this period of COVID-19. The proposed changes had potential to impact the way stakeholders co-designed and prioritised their work. Participants reported concern of both the timing of this proposed policy change and the content which they interpreted as allowing less local context.</p><p>Regarding the proposed health promotion priorities to be funded, multiple participants expressed concern:</p><p><em>‘The big elephant in the room</em>, <em>which we all know about</em>, <em>is the [new policy] guidelines</em>. <em>Um</em>, <em>they really</em>, <em>yeah</em>, <em>hinder us in the way that they’re very prescriptive and there’s not a lot of space for other things to happen</em>.<em>’ (FG1</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><p>One participant noted that the policy guidelines could ‘future proof’ their work if they were aligned with community-led implementation:</p><p><em>‘… if it’s in a strategic plan</em>, <em>and there’s alignment</em>, <em>and it has to happen</em>, <em>the turnover of the people is probably not as critical as it is with the linkages</em>. <em>Because if it’s in a plan</em>, <em>it’s got to be delivered</em>, <em>they’re accountable for that</em>. <em>So</em>, <em>… then it gets handed over to the next person and becomes that critical piece of work</em>.<em>’ (FG8</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>Multiple participants reported transitioning, often with little warning, in and out of policy changes due to health orders responding to changing pandemic conditions (e.g. example community lockdowns). A consequence of this rapid change in policy priority meant practitioners were unable to plan with certainty any community engagement activities or implement the prioritised actions of RESPOND:</p><p><em>‘I think so much of the impact as well is</em>, <em>what I said earlier</em>, <em>the stop and start nature of this year</em>. <em>I think we never were able to get momentum</em>, <em>or feeling of what we could do</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>you’d have a few months of being able to go in person to see people and then we’re back in lockdown</em>, <em>we’re out of lockdown</em>. <em>It was too uncertain to plan and do things as well because it was so in and out this year</em>.<em>’ (FG4</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><p><em>‘…we’ve since lost it again because of COVID</em>. <em>So</em>, <em>this continuous issue around building that momentum through community engagement to get community- led response</em>, <em>there’s a massive barrier when disaster happens</em>.<em>’ (FG8</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>One focus group reported that after multiple efforts to restart an initiative, a decision was made to pause:</p><p>‘… we made the call as a team that we were going to stop at a point and just breathe and wait till we could get somewhat back together and go again, so we did that in May and of course we had another interruption, set of interruptions and everything since’ (FG5, P1)</p><h4>Funding.</h4><p>While the funding for RESPOND did not change in response to the bushfires and COVID-19, participants reported that the shocks stretched in-kind contributions:</p><p><em>‘Upon reflection of how RESPOND was originally meant to fit into our current work role</em>, <em>the initial 10% that was sort of deemed as our EFT [equivalent full time] within our funding agreement</em>, <em>the 10% wasn’t a realistic figure at all</em>. <em>We didn’t have any additional funding or additional staff to be able to do it’ (FG9</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>This reflection on inadequate resourcing was experienced by others, who reported:</p><p><em>‘…we didn’t have the resources</em>. <em>The amount of pre- preparation work prior to GMBs</em>, <em>the amount of work post GMBs</em>, <em>it was essentially</em>, <em>we had every single team member working on that</em>, <em>and doing the minimal amount of other programs as opposed to RESPOND</em>. <em>And it was very much</em>, <em>we piled in our EFT just for that…</em> … <em>So it was this ebb and flow of EFT to RESPOND</em>. <em>So</em>, <em>I don’t think we had enough resources and we’re identifying right now that we’ve got some staffing issues in [local area] and that we won’t have enough for this year</em>.<em>’ (FG8</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>One community presented a more optimistic view, saying that the creation and funding of a RESPOND position enhanced community resilience (see related theme) following the COVID-19 and bushfire shocks and, protected RESPOND funding for its intended purpose in the face of competing priorities:</p><p>‘… [referring to person funded in position] having that role, be really pushing forward and keeping the momentum going, was definitely the reason that we were able to have the success that we’ve had’ (FG7, P3)</p><p><em>‘…we had [referring to colleague] employed with hours…so</em>, <em>for at least a day a week…we could quarantine those hours to RESPOND…so I think that helped in not diverting (colleague) to something else that could have been COVID-related</em>.<em>’</em> (FG3, P1)</p><h3>Provider characteristics</h3><h4>Redeployment of resources (emergent theme–related to perceived need for innovation, self-efficacy and skill proficiency).</h4><p>Many participants reported that their organisations asked them to ‘pivot’ individual roles and responsibilities to <em>“bushfire recovery work”</em> (FG5, P1), <em>“testing”</em> and <em>“contact tracing”</em> (FG1, P3), and COVID-19-related <em>“communications”</em> (FG9, P2).</p><p>‘… COVID also took a lot of our EFT for quite a while, at least from our organisation because so many different responses we were involved in, so for a good year, both myself and my co-worker for about half our jobs were probably doing COVID response, if not more’ (FG4, P3)</p><p>This ‘pivot’ displaced health promotion work, including working on RESPOND.</p><p>‘COVID’s had a huge impact and especially on our facilitation team too because a lot of them, like, … myself was only one day a week, … I stopped doing prevention to just focus purely on COVID related work’ (FG7, P1)</p><p>They also reported a lack of clarity from their organisations in terms of what tasks they were required to perform and when:</p><p><em>‘…there was a long time when officially we weren’t in the COVID response</em>, <em>but we suddenly had to man the front door</em>, <em>do screenings and stuff like that</em>, <em>and so it was a lot of unofficial “we just need bodies and we need hands to help as well”</em>, <em>so there was a bit of giving in that way</em>. <em>It’s only in the last six to nine months it’s really become a much more official allocation of roles and workload</em>. <em>Prior to that</em>, <em>it was just grab as needed</em>.<em>’ (FG4</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><p>In other organisations, the impact of redeployment was not as pronounced, but time available for health promotion was still impacted because of physical distancing requirements and ‘work-from-home’ advice:</p><p><em>‘…that’s not really been the cause of our lack of work in the RESPOND space</em>, <em>it’s more about that community engagement and that lack of ability to engage in a normal</em>, <em>in inverted commas</em>, <em>way</em>, <em>yeah so it’s not been a lack of staff</em>, <em>it’s more been about a lack of ability to get out and about and do the things in the way that we usually do</em>, <em>do things</em>.<em>’ (FG4</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><h3>Characteristics of the innovation</h3><h4>Compatibility (contextual appropriateness, fit, congruence, match).</h4><p>A key finding was that participants reported community priorities being pushed away from the objectives of RESPOND and towards managing COVID-19:</p><p><em>‘…there was a lot of momentum and there was a lot of people that were passionate about the project and willing to be a part of it</em>, <em>… that have just been pulled other places and that have other priorities like we all have throughout COVID</em>. <em>And</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>this [RESPOND] has been put on the backburner a bit’ (FG7</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>Participants described how the shocks made some priorities more urgent than others. Children’s healthy eating and physical activity was less of a priority due to COVID-19 despite the planning, agreements, partnerships and commitments that were in place. Instead, the emphasis was on mental health:</p><p><em>‘All of our Planned stuff has been put on the back burner to deal with COVID requirements… and majority of our conversations with our stakeholders has been around mental health</em>.<em>’ (FG6</em>, <em>P1)</em></p><h4>Adaptability (program modification, reinvention).</h4><p>Participants reported that adapting to COVID-19 made delivery of RESPOND harder because of requirements to work from home and to physically distance. This meant that meetings could not be face- to- face. Moving online was initially seen as a positive because it opened the possibility of engaging with people who had previously been difficult to reach, such as those living out of town. This did not eventuate for RESPOND however:</p><p><em>‘…you have to have some really committed people for them to actually be able to travel to do face-to-face</em>. <em>So I initially thought “Oh</em>, <em>this is going to be great</em>, <em>get lots of people from across the [local government area]” [into a virtual platform]</em>, <em>but we’ve actually really struggled to engage more broadly across the [local government area]’ (FG9</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>Participants described engaging with community members online as a poorer quality of engagement compared to face- to- face, and said it impacted their ability to deliver RESPOND.</p><p><em>‘…through COVID</em>, <em>one of the biggest things was that there is this new expectation around agility</em>, <em>and that adaptability</em>, <em>… and using digital engagement to actually get things done</em>, <em>but the thing is</em>, <em>there’s a difference between digital engagement and community engagement</em>, <em>they’re very different things</em>, <em>and you cannot necessarily do community engagement digitally</em>. <em>And we had very poor uptake when we tried to flip it</em>.<em>’ (FG8</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>This online shift may have particularly impacted RESPOND because initial community engagement was face- to- face and cumulative, enabling multiple formal and informal discussions that some participants felt did not transfer well to the online environment.</p><p>‘… because RESPOND was built on, especially here, a face-to-face model, you know, to take that offline, that’s just not realistic really,’ (FG5, P1)</p><p>‘… it’s all well and good to try to take things online, but is it actually having the same impact that we want it to have? Is it having the same meaning? Are we actually still reaching the purpose of the project in the first place by going online?’ (FG6, P6)</p><p>One participant outlined reasons they considered online engagement inferior:</p><p><em>‘I felt like with the group of people and it’s</em>, <em>it happens with all online things…people become hesitant to interrupt</em>, <em>… you don’t have those organic natural conversations</em>, <em>… I just feel like online you do miss out on some of the body language or cues or people that may want to say something but are too scared to interrupt online</em>.<em>’ (FG9</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><p>Conversely, one community reported that the move to online engagement wasn’t detrimental because of the foundation that was built prior to the first experience of lockdowns:</p><p>‘<em>so we did</em>, <em>obviously did all of our’s [referring to GMBs] just prior to the bushfires</em>. <em>So</em>, <em>which was probably really good for [our community]…</em>.<em>we had our group of interested community people</em>, <em>and then the other thing that did happen is that we offered our first lot of face- to- face interviews from our groups after bushfires</em>, <em>which was sort of end January pre- entering any form of COVID restrictions</em>, <em>so we did meet</em>, <em>we got one meeting with each of our groups… which I think</em>, <em>then</em>, <em>when we then had to go to online meetings</em>, <em>we had some really good ideas that had come out of those focus groups</em>, <em>as well as the meeting</em>, <em>to start to move forward to get some runs on the board</em>.<em>’ (FG3</em>, <em>P1)</em></p><h3>Factors relevant to the prevention delivery system: Organisational capacity</h3><h4>Integration of new work (extent to which an organisation can incorporate an innovation in its existing practices).</h4><p>Schools transitioning to remote learning and the restriction of early childhood services to essential workers (e.g., health care staff, police), pushed RESPOND activities further aside:</p><p><em>‘…unfortunately</em>, <em>by February when everybody was sort of back on board and raring to go</em>, <em>a lot of actions were either in community or working with settings such as schools</em>, <em>early years services</em>, <em>maternal child health nurse</em>, <em>health services that just were bombarded when it came to COVID</em>.<em>’ (FG7</em>, <em>P1)</em></p><p><em>‘it’s been hard to get into</em>, <em>get involved with our stakeholders</em>, <em>especially schools because they’ve been so busy and impacted</em>.<em>’ (FG6</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><h4>Shared decision making (local input, community participation or involvement, local ownership collaboration).</h4><p>Participants described both bushfires and COVID-19 severely hampering their ability to undertake community participation activities, to build local ownership of RESPOND, and strengthen collaborations as originally intended.</p><p>‘… there’s being really minimal contact from, like between us and the community, just because of yep bushfires, COVID …’ (FG1, P3)</p><p>‘… as with probably everybody, COVID hit and yeah the wheels fell off effectively……We still have been doing little bits and pieces in this space but yeah, certainly not anything to the scale of where we were hoping to get to after that last GMB with that great engagement’ (FG4, P2)</p><p>This was particularly true in schools that would normally be a core partner in health promotion activities.</p><p><em>‘… it’s been hard to get into</em>, <em>get involved with our stakeholders</em>, <em>especially schools because they’ve been so busy and impacted</em>.<em>’ (FG6</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><h4>Leadership and champions.</h4><p>Participants described previous experiences of bushfires, where local ‘champions’ had agreed to lead community prevention work but were pulled away to the urgent tasks of bushfire recovery. They expressed frustration that this had occurred again and that they were still vulnerable to shocks.</p><p>‘… we get stuck in these cycles where we’ll have a bushfire, and that impacts on everyone’s ability because you get staff burnout, you get people that you know, like I said, just have to concentrate on themselves and their own issues and they can’t, you know, be champions’ (FG7, P1)</p><p><em>‘Our key backbone group that we were going to utilise and lean on a lot was going to be our Rotary Club</em>, <em>and then our Rotary Club did go [and] give assistance to the bushfire area because (referring to local community) was obviously quite close to some of the other areas impacted</em>. <em>So we sort of lost a bit of engagement with them…’ (FG4</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><p>Participants noted that leadership changes are exaggerated in rural communities compared to metropolitan communities because leaders have multiple roles:</p><p><em>‘… because of the fact that we had community members there that wore so many hats…</em>.<em>Going into bushfires</em>, <em>… they were also involved in the CFA and so you know had no time to deal with all of the RESPOND stuff’ (FG1</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><h4>Fatigue (emergent theme).</h4><p>Many comments were made by participants regarding the uncertainty and exhaustion that both staff and community felt resulting from bushfires and COVID-19:</p><p>‘Within the community and their capacity, I think everybody is just exhausted from the past two years and they’re really struggling to take on anything extra’ (FG4, P1)</p><p><em>‘They were so sick of Zoom</em>. <em>They were so sick of cancelling</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>the emotional attachment and the financial attachment to set things up and cancel</em>. <em>In the end there’s been a lot of “Can we just wait ‘til this is over</em>?<em>”‘ (FG6</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>Participants also described fatigue in community stakeholders, particularly schools.</p><p><em>‘…it’s also the pushback from community</em>, <em>especially at the moment people are still getting back on their feet</em>. <em>Schools are still trying to get kids back in classrooms</em>.<em>’ (FG1</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><h4>Resilience and re-engagement <em>(emergent theme)</em>.</h4><p>Aware that original actions needed to be reviewed, several RESPOND community facilitators sought to re-engage their communities to re-prioritise and potentially identify new priorities. The quotes below demonstrate an understanding of the need to reassess community needs and re-engage with them. Evidence was seen of resilience and commitment of facilitators:</p><p><em>‘I think it’s almost more important now than ever to be getting that community’s perspective of what they need</em>, <em>because it’s so varied</em>, <em>even within the one LGA (local government area) it’s quite varied what our little towns need in regard to support and yeah</em>, <em>their requirements</em>, <em>so I think it’s more important now than it was before</em>.<em>’ (FG6</em>, <em>P1)</em></p><p>There was also evidence of community facilitators being aware of the need to honour people’s initial engagement and provide them with re-engagement opportunities. The questions posed in the below quote indicate strategies for adaptation to the new landscape the community were facing. They also demonstrate an understanding for the importance of planning to ensure actions could be operationalised:</p><p><em>‘the people that we have engaged</em>, <em>I think it’s really important to go back and give them the opportunity to revisit what those actions were</em>. <em>What is now going to work in our community</em>? <em>Who’s involved</em>? <em>Are there new leaders</em>? <em>Are there new people who are influencing people within the community</em>?<em>’ (FG9</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><h3>Factors related to the prevention support system</h3><p>In terms of the training needs of our participants, most acknowledged they had the skills required to undertake their roles. Participants reported resilience and an ongoing commitment to the health of local children and community wellbeing. What was less clear, was how to engage and successfully deliver a version of RESPOND in the wake of these system shocks.</p><p><em>‘I think COVID has</em>, <em>and that break and bushfires</em>, <em>has put everyone’s energy into a different space</em>. <em>And I think it was really important for us to do part two [revisit priorities for RESPOND] for our community to say this space is actually really</em>, <em>really important despite COVID</em>, <em>or alongside COVID</em>, <em>healthy eating/ physical activity is really important for our health</em>, <em>to keep ourselves healthy during that time of the pandemic as well</em>.<em>’ (FG9</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>‘<em>all of the way we look at the world and work and how we operate has had to shift</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>… what we thought might happen or what we thought might be possible</em>, <em>and what we could do</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>all had to get thrown out the window and to re- look at what does this mean…’ (FG2</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>In reflecting on the application of their skills in the use of community-based system dynamics, participants reflected that they were able to implement such work, develop a shared understanding of the issues, and commit to moving forward. Participants also reflected on the skills and shared values inherent in their rural communities:</p><p><em>‘…it’s easy-ish to identify lots of shared values</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>working together because we’ve got lots of shared values and I think</em>, <em>I don’t know</em>, <em>that felt to me like it was highlighted in COVID a bit</em>. <em>Like</em>, <em>there’s a</em>, <em>community looking after community</em>, <em>community caring about each other’s wellbeing</em>. <em>For example</em>, <em>our local supermarket… bought a van</em>, <em>so it started home delivery during COVID</em>, <em>… you know</em>, <em>there were people on Facebook</em>, <em>on the noticeboard saying</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>“I’m going shopping if anyone wants anything”‘ (FG6</em>, <em>P4)</em></p><p>These qualitative findings are expanded through the inclusion of the survey data, that provided more detail to some of the themes.</p><h3>Survey</h3><p>The majority of the 28 participants in the survey agreed/strongly agreed that their workplace considered RESPOND relevant to local needs (75%), was committed to the shared vision of RESPOND (89%), and that RESPOND was adaptable to the needs of their workplace (72%) (<a href=\"#pone-0287468-t002\">Table 2</a>). They also agreed/strongly agreed that strong community partnerships existed (78%). However, only 29% agreed/strongly agreed that their organisation had enough funding or could reorientate funding towards RESPOND, and only 36% agreed/strongly agreed that they had clear roles and responsibilities within RESPOND. Regarding political support, support from local political figures was high (67%), but support from state level politics was less clear at 47% of participants who agreed/strongly agreed that state policy supports the approach of RESPOND.

The colours identify the five Durlak and DuPre factors which are listed in the legend. A solid arrow between two factors demonstrates a relationship travelling in the same direction ie: as ‘shocks in the system’ increase, ‘fatigue’ also increases. Likewise, ‘as shocks in the system’ decrease, ‘fatigue’ also decreases. A dotted arrow indicates that there is a relationship travelling in opposite direction ie: as ‘fatigue’ increases, ‘engagement’ decreases, and as ‘fatigue’ decreases, ‘engagement’ increases. There are some examples in this figure which demonstrate a feedback loop, which recognises that some factors can get caught in a cycle ie: As ‘fatigue’ increases, ‘engagement’ decreases, which also decreases ‘momentum’. This study found that with a decrease in ‘momentum’, ‘fatigue’ was in fact increased, which was seen with the stop-start nature of COVID restrictions.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.g001</a></p><h2>Discussion</h2><h3>Main findings</h3><p>The implementation of a large, community-based trial to prevent childhood obesity in regional Victoria, Australia was heavily impacted by COVID-19 and further compounded by bushfires. Key factors associated, included the impact of unexpected funding and policy changes within communities and at the provider level, staff churn, redeployment to engage with the COVID response, limitations of working in online environments, changing priorities for leaders, and fatigue across all levels due to the intensity of the COVID response. Even with these shocks, participants also reported resilience, adaptability and an ongoing commitment to the goal of RESPOND in improving the health and wellbeing of children.</p><h3>Comparison to literature</h3><p>High redeployment levels of health promotion and community development staff to address COVID-19 has been observed across health sectors in Australia and internationally. Studies have reported similar impacts in low and middle-income countries, though perhaps even deeper where there was a rapid reduction in basic maternal, neonatal and child health services, indicating limited resilience within health systems [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>]. Other studies report the finding here that community health workers were mobilised to assist with the COVID-19 response [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>] and these roles changed rapidly, often without clear guidance or training. The impact of this redeployment and re-prioritisation has been variously described as affected [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>], compromised [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>], eroded [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>] and stressed [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>].</p><p>The re-deployment of existing staff to assist with the pandemic meant that multiple core roles were left unattended. While specific efforts were made to ensure RESPOND took an adaptive and reflexive approach [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>], the size of the shock meant human resources were removed from their core roles and RESPOND work was paused until COVID passed, meaning momentum was stymied.</p><p>While staff priorities shifted, so did that of the community. It was reported that many community members were not able to prioritise the work of RESPOND as they were being pulled in other directions and began to have more focus on addressing the mental health impacts of these shocks on communities. COVID-19 has been reported to increase psychological distress, and adversely impact mental and physical health among others [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>].</p><p>This study provided a reminder that active steps need to be taken by health promoters to generate and sustain political will for prevention [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>], or community-based innovations like RESPOND may be inadequately resourced to maintain core business in the face of system shocks, as was the case in Queensland from 1984 to 2014 [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>].</p><p>In this study, online engagement was reported as being less effective and less appropriate than in-person community engagement. These findings contrast with other studies, which found participants benefitting from online engagement and a broader representation of communities reached [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>] Given the growth in digital health technologies and potential of online technologies to reach marginalised community members, this is an area that warrants further research.</p><p>Inadequate resourcing of health promotion work has been a long- standing issue [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>], and these findings suggest that this was amplified by the disruptions of bushfires and COVID-19 in Northeast Victoria. Consistent with findings of the thematic analysis by Kavanagh et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>] who interviewed policy and program administrators in public health, and local community workers and volunteers in Tasmania, Australia, this study identified the importance of valuing people as a resource, respecting relationships both with community and organisations, and having adequate funding. The importance of soft infrastructure, such as relationships and networks were identified, both by Kavanagh [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>] and in this study. It was also identified, that the stronger the soft infrastructure in combination with adequate resources, the more likely those communities were able to cope with shocks, as seen by one RESPOND community.</p><h3>Strengths and weaknesses</h3><p>This is one of only a handful of studies to explore the impact of external shocks to intervention delivery. Participants were experienced practitioners directly involved in the delivery and support of health promotion. Qualitative, quantitative and systems science (CBSD) methods were used to analyse the results. The lack of varied characteristics of participants was one limitation of the research. School representatives were missing from this study, and due to significant staff turnover in the community health and community development workforce over this period, there were many people involved with RESPOND who had changed employment. Two participants who were no longer engaged with RESPOND still shared their insights within the focus groups.</p><p>Interpretation of any focus group data is subject to personal bias and in the case of this research, pragmatism, where the researchers were looking for the practical consequences of the bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic. It is possible that with this pragmatic lens, some nuance is lost.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Populations would benefit from a better funded and more prominent health promotion workforce that could focus on their role in implementing funded trials and preventing disease longer term. Health policy support that prioritises prevention could assist this. Without fundamental changes to policy and funding, health promotion practice is always at risk of the next ‘shock’ where resources will again be ‘re-deployed’ and their core skills undervalued. Research should include adaptive methods rather than be prescribed, so that work can continue when shocks occur.</p><p>Future research should explore additional methods that acknowledge complexity when working with shocks and how to track these shocks in real time. Additional resources required in health promotion roles needs to be identified to ensure that even when pivoting is necessary, core business can continue. The next step for this research is to reflect on what stakeholders consider could ‘shockproof’ their work.</p><p>Bushfires and COVID-19 provide an ongoing opportunity to learn how to harness prevention work and funded trials though adaptation and efficient resource allocation. This study identified that health promotion expertise was seen as ‘flexible’, rather than essential to the core business of prevention. When ‘shocks’ occur, the implementation of preventative approaches like RESPOND are reduced in priority to enable a crisis response.</p><h2>Supporting information</h2><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s001\">S1 File. </a>Focus group script.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s001\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s001</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(PDF)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s002\">S2 File. </a>Survey questions.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s002\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s002</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(PDF)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s003\">S1 Table. </a>Theme codebook.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s003\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s003</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(PDF)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s004\">S2 Table. </a>Completed COREQ checklist.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s004\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s004</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(PDF)</p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>The authors express gratitude to Mr Andrew Brown for assistance in developing <a href=\"#pone-0287468-g001\">Fig 1</a> and sourcing references.

Australia, like many countries, has high levels of obesity and extreme climate events. The Reflexive Evidence and Systems interventions to Prevent Obesity and Non-communicable Disease (RESPOND) trial aims to prevent unhealthy weight gain in children in 10 intervention and two pilot communities in north-east Victoria, Australia using community-based participatory approaches informed by systems science. Intervention activities co-designed in 2019 were disrupted by COVID-19 and bushfires. This paper explores the impacts of these ‘shocks’ on the local prevention workforce to implement actions within communities.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>A case study design involving one-hour online focus groups and an on-line survey (November 2021-February 2022). Purposive sampling was used to achieve diverse representation from RESPOND stakeholders including local council, health services, primary care partnerships and department of health. The focus group interview schedule and survey questions were based on Durlak and DuPre’s implementation factors.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Twenty-nine participants from seven different communities participated in at least one of nine focus groups to discuss the impacts of COVID-19 and bushfires on localised implementation. Twenty-eight participants (97% of focus group sample) also completed the on-line survey. Implementation of RESPOND stalled or stopped in most communities due to bushfires and/or COVID-19. These shocks resulted in organisational priorities changing, loss of momentum for implementation, redeployment of human resources, culminating in fatigue and exhaustion. Participants reported adaptation of RESPOND, but implementation was slowed due to limited resources.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Further research is needed to advance risk management strategies and protect resources within health promotion. System shocks such as bushfires and COVID-19 are inevitable, and despite multiple adaptation opportunities, this intervention approach was not ‘shock proof’.</p><p><strong>Citation: </strong>Whelan J, Hillenaar M, Fraser P, Allender S, Jackson M, Strugnell C, et al.

The latest Cochrane review on childhood obesity prevention reported limited effectiveness of existing interventions and called for a systems approach to prevention, highlighting that interventions designed to target the complex drivers (e.g. multi-faceted and multi-level) of childhood obesity are likely to have the greatest impact [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. The recent Lancet Commission on Obesity (2019) expanded the application of their 2011 call for a systems approach [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>] to prevent obesity, to also prevent undernutrition and climate change [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>].</p><p>In Australia, the total annual area of land affected by fire has increased significantly over the past 32 years [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>], and in 2019 and 2020 Australia experienced fires in each of the six states and one of the two territories of Australia [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. Northeast Victoria was one of the areas largely impacted by the 2019/20 bushfires, with the emergence of COVID-19 shortly following [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. Varying degrees of public health orders were put into place, such as limitations on public gatherings (outdoor and indoor), closure of specified retail business types, working from home requirements, and limits to the physical distance people could travel from their homes [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. Secondly, there were specific health consequences directly related to COVID-19. To date (August 2022), Australia has reported over 10 million cases of COVID-19 and more than 14,200 reported deaths [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>]. Beyond the immediate disease, there were physical and mental health impacts on health workers [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>] and documented impacts on mental health across community members more generally [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>].</p><p>At the time that the 2019/20 bushfires and COVID-19 hit northeast Victoria, communities in this area were also participating in the Reflexive Evidence and Systems interventions to Prevent Obesity and Non-communicable Disease (RESPOND) research project. In 2018, the RESPOND trial commenced in the Goulburn Valley and Ovens Murray regions [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. RESPOND is a 5-year, stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia and partners. It was scheduled to operate across five local government areas (step 1) from 2018, another five local government areas (step 2) from 2020 (2 years after step 1), and was preceded by work within two pilot communities from 2016. RESPOND uses community-based participatory research informed by systems science to build capacity within community stakeholders [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>] who then co-design actions to prevent unhealthy weight gain and improve health-related quality of life in children aged 5–12 years. Co-design began with a series of three group model building (GMB) workshops [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>] to build a systems map capturing local drivers of childhood obesity and preventive actions [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>].</p><p>Project stakeholders commenced implementation of local prioritised actions from 2019. Examples of such actions included increasing healthy food access through shares and swaps, food literacy and education programs, increasing opportunities for physical activity through enhancements to public spaces and come and try events, and increased communications and promotion of opportunities. The implementation for most communities was interrupted by bushfires in November 2019. The fires were described as ‘unprecedented’ [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>], with 21% of Australia’s temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome burned (New South Wales and Victoria), compared with 2% typical of previous major fire years [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. All communities in RESPOND were impacted to varying degrees by these bushfires, most directly through active fires, or smoke pollution. All RESPOND communities saw the reallocation of stakeholders, such as health promotion and council officers, to emergency response roles, where they were required to support the bushfire recovery and/or Victoria’s COVID-19 response. In addition, these stakeholders along with their community members, were impacted by work disruptions, illness, and deaths associated with COVID-19.</p><p>Implementation of initiatives in real-world interventions is always challenging. The field of Implementation Science provides guidance to enhance this uptake of evidence into practice [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>], and has identified specific factors for consideration during this implementation phase [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. Implementation is likely to be even more challenging when communities are impacted by shocks such as bushfires and COVID-19. This manuscript explored the impact of bushfires and COVID-19 on the stakeholders’ ability to implement RESPOND. This manuscript addresses the research question: ‘what factors related to bushfires and COVID-19 impacted stakeholders’ ability to implement RESPOND as planned?’</p><h2>Methods</h2><h3>Design and theoretical frame</h3><p>A case study approach was used to gather information on the impacts of bushfires and COVID-19 on the implementation of a large, funded trial. Ethics approval was obtained from Deakin University HEAG_H 172_2018. We drew on Community-Based Systems Dynamics (CBSD) and Implementation Science frameworks. CBSD informed the co-design of the RESPOND interventions and gave us a process for identifying and managing complex and dynamic community determinants of children’s health. Implementation science, and the Durlak and Dupre [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>] framework in particular, guided the development of the survey and focus group questioning. Following this, the framework also informed the theming and identification of implementation factors. CBSD was again used for summarising themes.</p><h3>Context–The RESPOND intervention</h3><p>RESPOND is a community-led change initiative that focusses on creating healthier environments for children aged 0 to 12 years across 10 local government areas (approximately 30,000 children) in north-east Victoria, Australia. More detail is provided in the published protocol [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>].</p><h3>Research team and reflexivity</h3><p>Focus groups were conducted by Author 1 (PhD) as facilitator, with Author 2 (BHlthSc) as notetaker. Author 1 has specific training in qualitative methodologies. Author 2 has been involved in qualitative research previously. Author 1 was employed as a Postdoctoral Researcher and Author 2 as a Project Manager and Implementation Coach for RESPOND at the time of the research. Data collection and analysis was grounded in pragmatic epistemology. By adopting pragmatism, the researchers looked at understanding and addressing problems in a real- world context [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>], embracing the messiness of everyday life [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. Study insights were informed by team members’ understanding of the context, the broader RESPOND study, methodological experience, and field-based knowledge. Researcher perspectives were guided by the recent Lancet Commission on Obesity, community-based systems dynamics, and traditional health promotion frameworks such as the Ottawa Charter. At the time of conducting this research, all authors, except PF, had varying degrees of a pre-existing relationship with most participants through involvement with the RESPOND project. No other researchers or non-participants were present at the focus group sessions.</p><h3>Participants and recruitment</h3><p>Participants were recruited via email through existing networks from two pilot communities (City of Greater Shepparton and Moira Shire) and five Step 1 communities (Strathbogie Shire, Murrindindi Shire, Mansfield Shire, Indigo Shire and City of Wodonga). Purposive sampling was used to achieve participation from a range of stakeholders involved with implementing RESPOND in each community. Invited participants (hereafter participants) included staff (community development and health promotion) from local government, the health sector, primary care partnerships, state government departments of health and sporting organisations. Written consent was provided by each participant. Where this consent was not received prior to the focus group session, verbal consent was sought and audio recorded at the beginning of this session, and written consent was received prior to analysis.</p><h3>Data collection</h3><p>Data were collected from one-hour online focus groups and an on-line survey with RESPOND stakeholders (November 2021-February 2022). The focus group schedule (<a href=\"#pone.0287468.s001\">S1 File</a>) and survey (<a href=\"#pone.0287468.s002\">S2 File</a>) were based on implementation factors proposed by Durlak and DuPre [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>] and used to facilitate the discussion of the impacts of COVID-19 and bushfires (henceforth ‘shocks’) on the capacity of RESPOND stakeholders to implement intervention activities in communities. Durlak and DuPre [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>] reviewed and synthesised 542 implementation studies and identified five broad factors impacting implementation: community level factors (e.g., politics, funding); provider characteristics (e.g., perceived benefits of innovation); characteristics of the innovation (e.g., compatibility and adaptability); factors related to the prevention delivery system (e.g., work climate, shared decision making, leadership), and factors related to the prevention support system (e.g., training).</p><p>A focus group was scheduled for each of the Step 1 communities (n = 5) and one focus group for the pilot communities, to discuss the impact of the bushfires and COVID-19 on participants and the implementation of RESPOND. Additional focus groups (n = 3) were scheduled to accommodate requests to participate from people who had been invited but were unable to attend the initial sessions. Focus group transcripts were reviewed by authors 1 and 2 after each session. At the conclusion of the nine focus groups, authors 1 and 2 agreed that no new themes were emerging, and that data saturation was reached. Focus groups were audio and visual recorded using Zoom [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>], and transcribed verbatim. A notetaker (author 2) took notes during each focus group as a backup and for clarification (if required) of the online recording. Once de-identified, transcripts were returned to all participants for review and editing. No significant feedback from participants was received; only simple grammatical and de-identifying advice. The finalised transcripts were imported into NVivo [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>]. All identifiable information was securely stored via password protection on Author 2’s Deakin University computer system.</p><p>At the conclusion of the focus group, participants were invited to complete a 15-question on-line survey. Responses to the questions were recorded on a 5-point Likert scale—Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly Disagree. Results from the survey were exported to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and summarised. This survey’s purpose was to complement the qualitative data from the focus group questions.</p><h3>Data analysis</h3><p>Transcripts were themed to the implementation factors identified by Durlak and DuPre [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>] based on a codebook developed by authors 1 &amp; 3 (<a href=\"#pone.0287468.s003\">S1 Table</a>). An additional theme of ‘system shocks’ was added to capture the bushfire and COVID-19 events. Where aspects from the transcripts did not align with the framework, emergent themes were created. During the process of data analysis, the researchers most closely involved in data collection and analyses (Authors 1, 2 &amp; 3) met regularly to discuss coding to the framework and the emerging themes, clarify analysis and share reflections. At this stage, input was sought from other team members with experience in the RESPOND project (Authors 4, 5, 6 &amp; 7). De-identified quotes drawn from the thematic coding were used to illustrate themes. Summarised survey results were captured in a table, with each question grouped in to one of three themes. These themes were derived from the themes within the codebook (<a href=\"#pone.0287468.s003\">S1 Table</a>). After analysis of the focus groups and surveys, the inter-relationship between the factors impacting implementation were connected visually using STICKE software [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>]. This was done by Author 2 using CBSD principles and experience, and with support from systems science expert Andrew Brown. Connections were derived from the focus group discussions and were considered by all authors, to add value to the narrative and connections of the identified factors.</p><h2>Findings</h2><p>A total of 29 people participated in one of nine focus groups. One participant attended two focus groups as they were representing a different community in each and provided input for each community. Twenty-eight of these participants also completed the survey. All identified stakeholder groups were represented by at least one participant, with highest participation from the health sector (n = 19), followed by local government (n = 5), primary care partnerships (n = 4), state government (n = 1), and regional sports assemblies (n = 1). See <a href=\"#pone-0287468-t001\">Table 1</a>. All participants had been involved with RESPOND for at least two weeks, with most having been involved for the duration of the project to date (˜ 2 years). Preliminary findings were shared with participants through a regular network meeting and no significant feedback was provided.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.t001</a></p><h3>System shocks—bushfires and COVID-19</h3><p>Participants described responding to bushfires as routine because of previous bushfire responses.</p><p><em>‘…there’s a historical aspect to this</em>. <em>The northeast of…Victoria has … every three or four years have dealt with major bushfires to varying levels of… extremity I suppose’ (FG8</em>, <em>P1)</em></p><p>However, the shock of COVID-19 was considered overwhelming because it was in addition to the bushfire shock and it impacted many more people. The sentiment, as captured in the quotes below, was that communities had faced one thing after another, and they were tired and perhaps less likely to engage with RESPOND as a result.</p><p><em>‘…if it was just bushfires alone I can’t imagine that would have had much of an issue</em>, <em>but it was a knock on effect</em>, <em>that plus</em>, <em>then COVID being the real impact</em>.<em>’ (FG4</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p><em>‘…people were exhausted</em>. <em>They were fatigued</em>, <em>not just</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>first of all</em>, <em>they were fatigued from bushfires</em>, <em>but then they got to COVID and they were still fatigued from bushfires</em>, <em>and then COVID on top of it</em>.<em>’ (FG8</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><h3>Community level factors</h3><h4>Policy.</h4><p>Discussion of policy comprised two elements: firstly, there were elements of policy in terms of public health orders that limited, for example, stakeholder capacity to engage with community members in person; second, changes to state level health promotion guidelines were provided to local stakeholders for review during this period of COVID-19. The proposed changes had potential to impact the way stakeholders co-designed and prioritised their work. Participants reported concern of both the timing of this proposed policy change and the content which they interpreted as allowing less local context.</p><p>Regarding the proposed health promotion priorities to be funded, multiple participants expressed concern:</p><p><em>‘The big elephant in the room</em>, <em>which we all know about</em>, <em>is the [new policy] guidelines</em>. <em>Um</em>, <em>they really</em>, <em>yeah</em>, <em>hinder us in the way that they’re very prescriptive and there’s not a lot of space for other things to happen</em>.<em>’ (FG1</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><p>One participant noted that the policy guidelines could ‘future proof’ their work if they were aligned with community-led implementation:</p><p><em>‘… if it’s in a strategic plan</em>, <em>and there’s alignment</em>, <em>and it has to happen</em>, <em>the turnover of the people is probably not as critical as it is with the linkages</em>. <em>Because if it’s in a plan</em>, <em>it’s got to be delivered</em>, <em>they’re accountable for that</em>. <em>So</em>, <em>… then it gets handed over to the next person and becomes that critical piece of work</em>.<em>’ (FG8</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>Multiple participants reported transitioning, often with little warning, in and out of policy changes due to health orders responding to changing pandemic conditions (e.g. example community lockdowns). A consequence of this rapid change in policy priority meant practitioners were unable to plan with certainty any community engagement activities or implement the prioritised actions of RESPOND:</p><p><em>‘I think so much of the impact as well is</em>, <em>what I said earlier</em>, <em>the stop and start nature of this year</em>. <em>I think we never were able to get momentum</em>, <em>or feeling of what we could do</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>you’d have a few months of being able to go in person to see people and then we’re back in lockdown</em>, <em>we’re out of lockdown</em>. <em>It was too uncertain to plan and do things as well because it was so in and out this year</em>.<em>’ (FG4</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><p><em>‘…we’ve since lost it again because of COVID</em>. <em>So</em>, <em>this continuous issue around building that momentum through community engagement to get community- led response</em>, <em>there’s a massive barrier when disaster happens</em>.<em>’ (FG8</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>One focus group reported that after multiple efforts to restart an initiative, a decision was made to pause:</p><p>‘… we made the call as a team that we were going to stop at a point and just breathe and wait till we could get somewhat back together and go again, so we did that in May and of course we had another interruption, set of interruptions and everything since’ (FG5, P1)</p><h4>Funding.</h4><p>While the funding for RESPOND did not change in response to the bushfires and COVID-19, participants reported that the shocks stretched in-kind contributions:</p><p><em>‘Upon reflection of how RESPOND was originally meant to fit into our current work role</em>, <em>the initial 10% that was sort of deemed as our EFT [equivalent full time] within our funding agreement</em>, <em>the 10% wasn’t a realistic figure at all</em>. <em>We didn’t have any additional funding or additional staff to be able to do it’ (FG9</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>This reflection on inadequate resourcing was experienced by others, who reported:</p><p><em>‘…we didn’t have the resources</em>. <em>The amount of pre- preparation work prior to GMBs</em>, <em>the amount of work post GMBs</em>, <em>it was essentially</em>, <em>we had every single team member working on that</em>, <em>and doing the minimal amount of other programs as opposed to RESPOND</em>. <em>And it was very much</em>, <em>we piled in our EFT just for that…</em> … <em>So it was this ebb and flow of EFT to RESPOND</em>. <em>So</em>, <em>I don’t think we had enough resources and we’re identifying right now that we’ve got some staffing issues in [local area] and that we won’t have enough for this year</em>.<em>’ (FG8</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>One community presented a more optimistic view, saying that the creation and funding of a RESPOND position enhanced community resilience (see related theme) following the COVID-19 and bushfire shocks and, protected RESPOND funding for its intended purpose in the face of competing priorities:</p><p>‘… [referring to person funded in position] having that role, be really pushing forward and keeping the momentum going, was definitely the reason that we were able to have the success that we’ve had’ (FG7, P3)</p><p><em>‘…we had [referring to colleague] employed with hours…so</em>, <em>for at least a day a week…we could quarantine those hours to RESPOND…so I think that helped in not diverting (colleague) to something else that could have been COVID-related</em>.<em>’</em> (FG3, P1)</p><h3>Provider characteristics</h3><h4>Redeployment of resources (emergent theme–related to perceived need for innovation, self-efficacy and skill proficiency).</h4><p>Many participants reported that their organisations asked them to ‘pivot’ individual roles and responsibilities to <em>“bushfire recovery work”</em> (FG5, P1), <em>“testing”</em> and <em>“contact tracing”</em> (FG1, P3), and COVID-19-related <em>“communications”</em> (FG9, P2).</p><p>‘… COVID also took a lot of our EFT for quite a while, at least from our organisation because so many different responses we were involved in, so for a good year, both myself and my co-worker for about half our jobs were probably doing COVID response, if not more’ (FG4, P3)</p><p>This ‘pivot’ displaced health promotion work, including working on RESPOND.</p><p>‘COVID’s had a huge impact and especially on our facilitation team too because a lot of them, like, … myself was only one day a week, … I stopped doing prevention to just focus purely on COVID related work’ (FG7, P1)</p><p>They also reported a lack of clarity from their organisations in terms of what tasks they were required to perform and when:</p><p><em>‘…there was a long time when officially we weren’t in the COVID response</em>, <em>but we suddenly had to man the front door</em>, <em>do screenings and stuff like that</em>, <em>and so it was a lot of unofficial “we just need bodies and we need hands to help as well”</em>, <em>so there was a bit of giving in that way</em>. <em>It’s only in the last six to nine months it’s really become a much more official allocation of roles and workload</em>. <em>Prior to that</em>, <em>it was just grab as needed</em>.<em>’ (FG4</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><p>In other organisations, the impact of redeployment was not as pronounced, but time available for health promotion was still impacted because of physical distancing requirements and ‘work-from-home’ advice:</p><p><em>‘…that’s not really been the cause of our lack of work in the RESPOND space</em>, <em>it’s more about that community engagement and that lack of ability to engage in a normal</em>, <em>in inverted commas</em>, <em>way</em>, <em>yeah so it’s not been a lack of staff</em>, <em>it’s more been about a lack of ability to get out and about and do the things in the way that we usually do</em>, <em>do things</em>.<em>’ (FG4</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><h3>Characteristics of the innovation</h3><h4>Compatibility (contextual appropriateness, fit, congruence, match).</h4><p>A key finding was that participants reported community priorities being pushed away from the objectives of RESPOND and towards managing COVID-19:</p><p><em>‘…there was a lot of momentum and there was a lot of people that were passionate about the project and willing to be a part of it</em>, <em>… that have just been pulled other places and that have other priorities like we all have throughout COVID</em>. <em>And</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>this [RESPOND] has been put on the backburner a bit’ (FG7</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>Participants described how the shocks made some priorities more urgent than others. Children’s healthy eating and physical activity was less of a priority due to COVID-19 despite the planning, agreements, partnerships and commitments that were in place. Instead, the emphasis was on mental health:</p><p><em>‘All of our Planned stuff has been put on the back burner to deal with COVID requirements… and majority of our conversations with our stakeholders has been around mental health</em>.<em>’ (FG6</em>, <em>P1)</em></p><h4>Adaptability (program modification, reinvention).</h4><p>Participants reported that adapting to COVID-19 made delivery of RESPOND harder because of requirements to work from home and to physically distance. This meant that meetings could not be face- to- face. Moving online was initially seen as a positive because it opened the possibility of engaging with people who had previously been difficult to reach, such as those living out of town. This did not eventuate for RESPOND however:</p><p><em>‘…you have to have some really committed people for them to actually be able to travel to do face-to-face</em>. <em>So I initially thought “Oh</em>, <em>this is going to be great</em>, <em>get lots of people from across the [local government area]” [into a virtual platform]</em>, <em>but we’ve actually really struggled to engage more broadly across the [local government area]’ (FG9</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>Participants described engaging with community members online as a poorer quality of engagement compared to face- to- face, and said it impacted their ability to deliver RESPOND.</p><p><em>‘…through COVID</em>, <em>one of the biggest things was that there is this new expectation around agility</em>, <em>and that adaptability</em>, <em>… and using digital engagement to actually get things done</em>, <em>but the thing is</em>, <em>there’s a difference between digital engagement and community engagement</em>, <em>they’re very different things</em>, <em>and you cannot necessarily do community engagement digitally</em>. <em>And we had very poor uptake when we tried to flip it</em>.<em>’ (FG8</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>This online shift may have particularly impacted RESPOND because initial community engagement was face- to- face and cumulative, enabling multiple formal and informal discussions that some participants felt did not transfer well to the online environment.</p><p>‘… because RESPOND was built on, especially here, a face-to-face model, you know, to take that offline, that’s just not realistic really,’ (FG5, P1)</p><p>‘… it’s all well and good to try to take things online, but is it actually having the same impact that we want it to have? Is it having the same meaning? Are we actually still reaching the purpose of the project in the first place by going online?’ (FG6, P6)</p><p>One participant outlined reasons they considered online engagement inferior:</p><p><em>‘I felt like with the group of people and it’s</em>, <em>it happens with all online things…people become hesitant to interrupt</em>, <em>… you don’t have those organic natural conversations</em>, <em>… I just feel like online you do miss out on some of the body language or cues or people that may want to say something but are too scared to interrupt online</em>.<em>’ (FG9</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><p>Conversely, one community reported that the move to online engagement wasn’t detrimental because of the foundation that was built prior to the first experience of lockdowns:</p><p>‘<em>so we did</em>, <em>obviously did all of our’s [referring to GMBs] just prior to the bushfires</em>. <em>So</em>, <em>which was probably really good for [our community]…</em>.<em>we had our group of interested community people</em>, <em>and then the other thing that did happen is that we offered our first lot of face- to- face interviews from our groups after bushfires</em>, <em>which was sort of end January pre- entering any form of COVID restrictions</em>, <em>so we did meet</em>, <em>we got one meeting with each of our groups… which I think</em>, <em>then</em>, <em>when we then had to go to online meetings</em>, <em>we had some really good ideas that had come out of those focus groups</em>, <em>as well as the meeting</em>, <em>to start to move forward to get some runs on the board</em>.<em>’ (FG3</em>, <em>P1)</em></p><h3>Factors relevant to the prevention delivery system: Organisational capacity</h3><h4>Integration of new work (extent to which an organisation can incorporate an innovation in its existing practices).</h4><p>Schools transitioning to remote learning and the restriction of early childhood services to essential workers (e.g., health care staff, police), pushed RESPOND activities further aside:</p><p><em>‘…unfortunately</em>, <em>by February when everybody was sort of back on board and raring to go</em>, <em>a lot of actions were either in community or working with settings such as schools</em>, <em>early years services</em>, <em>maternal child health nurse</em>, <em>health services that just were bombarded when it came to COVID</em>.<em>’ (FG7</em>, <em>P1)</em></p><p><em>‘it’s been hard to get into</em>, <em>get involved with our stakeholders</em>, <em>especially schools because they’ve been so busy and impacted</em>.<em>’ (FG6</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><h4>Shared decision making (local input, community participation or involvement, local ownership collaboration).</h4><p>Participants described both bushfires and COVID-19 severely hampering their ability to undertake community participation activities, to build local ownership of RESPOND, and strengthen collaborations as originally intended.</p><p>‘… there’s being really minimal contact from, like between us and the community, just because of yep bushfires, COVID …’ (FG1, P3)</p><p>‘… as with probably everybody, COVID hit and yeah the wheels fell off effectively……We still have been doing little bits and pieces in this space but yeah, certainly not anything to the scale of where we were hoping to get to after that last GMB with that great engagement’ (FG4, P2)</p><p>This was particularly true in schools that would normally be a core partner in health promotion activities.</p><p><em>‘… it’s been hard to get into</em>, <em>get involved with our stakeholders</em>, <em>especially schools because they’ve been so busy and impacted</em>.<em>’ (FG6</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><h4>Leadership and champions.</h4><p>Participants described previous experiences of bushfires, where local ‘champions’ had agreed to lead community prevention work but were pulled away to the urgent tasks of bushfire recovery. They expressed frustration that this had occurred again and that they were still vulnerable to shocks.</p><p>‘… we get stuck in these cycles where we’ll have a bushfire, and that impacts on everyone’s ability because you get staff burnout, you get people that you know, like I said, just have to concentrate on themselves and their own issues and they can’t, you know, be champions’ (FG7, P1)</p><p><em>‘Our key backbone group that we were going to utilise and lean on a lot was going to be our Rotary Club</em>, <em>and then our Rotary Club did go [and] give assistance to the bushfire area because (referring to local community) was obviously quite close to some of the other areas impacted</em>. <em>So we sort of lost a bit of engagement with them…’ (FG4</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><p>Participants noted that leadership changes are exaggerated in rural communities compared to metropolitan communities because leaders have multiple roles:</p><p><em>‘… because of the fact that we had community members there that wore so many hats…</em>.<em>Going into bushfires</em>, <em>… they were also involved in the CFA and so you know had no time to deal with all of the RESPOND stuff’ (FG1</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><h4>Fatigue (emergent theme).</h4><p>Many comments were made by participants regarding the uncertainty and exhaustion that both staff and community felt resulting from bushfires and COVID-19:</p><p>‘Within the community and their capacity, I think everybody is just exhausted from the past two years and they’re really struggling to take on anything extra’ (FG4, P1)</p><p><em>‘They were so sick of Zoom</em>. <em>They were so sick of cancelling</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>the emotional attachment and the financial attachment to set things up and cancel</em>. <em>In the end there’s been a lot of “Can we just wait ‘til this is over</em>?<em>”‘ (FG6</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>Participants also described fatigue in community stakeholders, particularly schools.</p><p><em>‘…it’s also the pushback from community</em>, <em>especially at the moment people are still getting back on their feet</em>. <em>Schools are still trying to get kids back in classrooms</em>.<em>’ (FG1</em>, <em>P3)</em></p><h4>Resilience and re-engagement <em>(emergent theme)</em>.</h4><p>Aware that original actions needed to be reviewed, several RESPOND community facilitators sought to re-engage their communities to re-prioritise and potentially identify new priorities. The quotes below demonstrate an understanding of the need to reassess community needs and re-engage with them. Evidence was seen of resilience and commitment of facilitators:</p><p><em>‘I think it’s almost more important now than ever to be getting that community’s perspective of what they need</em>, <em>because it’s so varied</em>, <em>even within the one LGA (local government area) it’s quite varied what our little towns need in regard to support and yeah</em>, <em>their requirements</em>, <em>so I think it’s more important now than it was before</em>.<em>’ (FG6</em>, <em>P1)</em></p><p>There was also evidence of community facilitators being aware of the need to honour people’s initial engagement and provide them with re-engagement opportunities. The questions posed in the below quote indicate strategies for adaptation to the new landscape the community were facing. They also demonstrate an understanding for the importance of planning to ensure actions could be operationalised:</p><p><em>‘the people that we have engaged</em>, <em>I think it’s really important to go back and give them the opportunity to revisit what those actions were</em>. <em>What is now going to work in our community</em>? <em>Who’s involved</em>? <em>Are there new leaders</em>? <em>Are there new people who are influencing people within the community</em>?<em>’ (FG9</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><h3>Factors related to the prevention support system</h3><p>In terms of the training needs of our participants, most acknowledged they had the skills required to undertake their roles. Participants reported resilience and an ongoing commitment to the health of local children and community wellbeing. What was less clear, was how to engage and successfully deliver a version of RESPOND in the wake of these system shocks.</p><p><em>‘I think COVID has</em>, <em>and that break and bushfires</em>, <em>has put everyone’s energy into a different space</em>. <em>And I think it was really important for us to do part two [revisit priorities for RESPOND] for our community to say this space is actually really</em>, <em>really important despite COVID</em>, <em>or alongside COVID</em>, <em>healthy eating/ physical activity is really important for our health</em>, <em>to keep ourselves healthy during that time of the pandemic as well</em>.<em>’ (FG9</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>‘<em>all of the way we look at the world and work and how we operate has had to shift</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>… what we thought might happen or what we thought might be possible</em>, <em>and what we could do</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>all had to get thrown out the window and to re- look at what does this mean…’ (FG2</em>, <em>P2)</em></p><p>In reflecting on the application of their skills in the use of community-based system dynamics, participants reflected that they were able to implement such work, develop a shared understanding of the issues, and commit to moving forward. Participants also reflected on the skills and shared values inherent in their rural communities:</p><p><em>‘…it’s easy-ish to identify lots of shared values</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>working together because we’ve got lots of shared values and I think</em>, <em>I don’t know</em>, <em>that felt to me like it was highlighted in COVID a bit</em>. <em>Like</em>, <em>there’s a</em>, <em>community looking after community</em>, <em>community caring about each other’s wellbeing</em>. <em>For example</em>, <em>our local supermarket… bought a van</em>, <em>so it started home delivery during COVID</em>, <em>… you know</em>, <em>there were people on Facebook</em>, <em>on the noticeboard saying</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>“I’m going shopping if anyone wants anything”‘ (FG6</em>, <em>P4)</em></p><p>These qualitative findings are expanded through the inclusion of the survey data, that provided more detail to some of the themes.</p><h3>Survey</h3><p>The majority of the 28 participants in the survey agreed/strongly agreed that their workplace considered RESPOND relevant to local needs (75%), was committed to the shared vision of RESPOND (89%), and that RESPOND was adaptable to the needs of their workplace (72%) (<a href=\"#pone-0287468-t002\">Table 2</a>). They also agreed/strongly agreed that strong community partnerships existed (78%). However, only 29% agreed/strongly agreed that their organisation had enough funding or could reorientate funding towards RESPOND, and only 36% agreed/strongly agreed that they had clear roles and responsibilities within RESPOND. Regarding political support, support from local political figures was high (67%), but support from state level politics was less clear at 47% of participants who agreed/strongly agreed that state policy supports the approach of RESPOND.

The colours identify the five Durlak and DuPre factors which are listed in the legend. A solid arrow between two factors demonstrates a relationship travelling in the same direction ie: as ‘shocks in the system’ increase, ‘fatigue’ also increases. Likewise, ‘as shocks in the system’ decrease, ‘fatigue’ also decreases. A dotted arrow indicates that there is a relationship travelling in opposite direction ie: as ‘fatigue’ increases, ‘engagement’ decreases, and as ‘fatigue’ decreases, ‘engagement’ increases. There are some examples in this figure which demonstrate a feedback loop, which recognises that some factors can get caught in a cycle ie: As ‘fatigue’ increases, ‘engagement’ decreases, which also decreases ‘momentum’. This study found that with a decrease in ‘momentum’, ‘fatigue’ was in fact increased, which was seen with the stop-start nature of COVID restrictions.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.g001</a></p><h2>Discussion</h2><h3>Main findings</h3><p>The implementation of a large, community-based trial to prevent childhood obesity in regional Victoria, Australia was heavily impacted by COVID-19 and further compounded by bushfires. Key factors associated, included the impact of unexpected funding and policy changes within communities and at the provider level, staff churn, redeployment to engage with the COVID response, limitations of working in online environments, changing priorities for leaders, and fatigue across all levels due to the intensity of the COVID response. Even with these shocks, participants also reported resilience, adaptability and an ongoing commitment to the goal of RESPOND in improving the health and wellbeing of children.</p><h3>Comparison to literature</h3><p>High redeployment levels of health promotion and community development staff to address COVID-19 has been observed across health sectors in Australia and internationally. Studies have reported similar impacts in low and middle-income countries, though perhaps even deeper where there was a rapid reduction in basic maternal, neonatal and child health services, indicating limited resilience within health systems [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>]. Other studies report the finding here that community health workers were mobilised to assist with the COVID-19 response [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>] and these roles changed rapidly, often without clear guidance or training. The impact of this redeployment and re-prioritisation has been variously described as affected [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>], compromised [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>], eroded [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>] and stressed [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>].</p><p>The re-deployment of existing staff to assist with the pandemic meant that multiple core roles were left unattended. While specific efforts were made to ensure RESPOND took an adaptive and reflexive approach [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>], the size of the shock meant human resources were removed from their core roles and RESPOND work was paused until COVID passed, meaning momentum was stymied.</p><p>While staff priorities shifted, so did that of the community. It was reported that many community members were not able to prioritise the work of RESPOND as they were being pulled in other directions and began to have more focus on addressing the mental health impacts of these shocks on communities. COVID-19 has been reported to increase psychological distress, and adversely impact mental and physical health among others [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>].</p><p>This study provided a reminder that active steps need to be taken by health promoters to generate and sustain political will for prevention [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>], or community-based innovations like RESPOND may be inadequately resourced to maintain core business in the face of system shocks, as was the case in Queensland from 1984 to 2014 [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>].</p><p>In this study, online engagement was reported as being less effective and less appropriate than in-person community engagement. These findings contrast with other studies, which found participants benefitting from online engagement and a broader representation of communities reached [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>] Given the growth in digital health technologies and potential of online technologies to reach marginalised community members, this is an area that warrants further research.</p><p>Inadequate resourcing of health promotion work has been a long- standing issue [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>], and these findings suggest that this was amplified by the disruptions of bushfires and COVID-19 in Northeast Victoria. Consistent with findings of the thematic analysis by Kavanagh et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>] who interviewed policy and program administrators in public health, and local community workers and volunteers in Tasmania, Australia, this study identified the importance of valuing people as a resource, respecting relationships both with community and organisations, and having adequate funding. The importance of soft infrastructure, such as relationships and networks were identified, both by Kavanagh [<a href=\"#pone.0287468.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>] and in this study. It was also identified, that the stronger the soft infrastructure in combination with adequate resources, the more likely those communities were able to cope with shocks, as seen by one RESPOND community.</p><h3>Strengths and weaknesses</h3><p>This is one of only a handful of studies to explore the impact of external shocks to intervention delivery. Participants were experienced practitioners directly involved in the delivery and support of health promotion. Qualitative, quantitative and systems science (CBSD) methods were used to analyse the results. The lack of varied characteristics of participants was one limitation of the research. School representatives were missing from this study, and due to significant staff turnover in the community health and community development workforce over this period, there were many people involved with RESPOND who had changed employment. Two participants who were no longer engaged with RESPOND still shared their insights within the focus groups.</p><p>Interpretation of any focus group data is subject to personal bias and in the case of this research, pragmatism, where the researchers were looking for the practical consequences of the bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic. It is possible that with this pragmatic lens, some nuance is lost.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Populations would benefit from a better funded and more prominent health promotion workforce that could focus on their role in implementing funded trials and preventing disease longer term. Health policy support that prioritises prevention could assist this. Without fundamental changes to policy and funding, health promotion practice is always at risk of the next ‘shock’ where resources will again be ‘re-deployed’ and their core skills undervalued. Research should include adaptive methods rather than be prescribed, so that work can continue when shocks occur.</p><p>Future research should explore additional methods that acknowledge complexity when working with shocks and how to track these shocks in real time. Additional resources required in health promotion roles needs to be identified to ensure that even when pivoting is necessary, core business can continue. The next step for this research is to reflect on what stakeholders consider could ‘shockproof’ their work.</p><p>Bushfires and COVID-19 provide an ongoing opportunity to learn how to harness prevention work and funded trials though adaptation and efficient resource allocation. This study identified that health promotion expertise was seen as ‘flexible’, rather than essential to the core business of prevention. When ‘shocks’ occur, the implementation of preventative approaches like RESPOND are reduced in priority to enable a crisis response.</p><h2>Supporting information</h2><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s001\">S1 File. </a>Focus group script.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s001\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s001</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(PDF)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s002\">S2 File. </a>Survey questions.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s002\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s002</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(PDF)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s003\">S1 Table. </a>Theme codebook.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s003\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s003</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(PDF)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s004\">S2 Table. </a>Completed COREQ checklist.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s004\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287468.s004</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(PDF)</p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>The authors express gratitude to Mr Andrew Brown for assistance in developing <a href=\"#pone-0287468-g001\">Fig 1</a> and sourcing references.

Numerous studies have revealed potential prognostic markers, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>] and disease- and progression-related cellular pathways, most of which are related to immune system dysregulation [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>], blood-brain barrier disruption [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>], oligodendrocyte death [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>], and axonal loss [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. At disease onset, it is important to decide the type of treatment in a patient-specific manner based on the overall clinical, MRI, immunological, neurophysiological, and all other prognostic findings of each patient. However, although many clinical and radiological studies have been conducted, the time of progression cannot be reliably predicted based on these parameters, highlighting the need for strong biological markers for improved treatment decision-making. In this context, various candidate prognostic serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers have been proposed for MS, such as neurofilament light chain [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>] and glial fibrillary acid protein [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no large-scale prospective clinical analysis using initial CSF proteomics data of an MS cohort with long-term clinical follow-up. Such prospective analyses are warranted to lend credence to the proposed candidate biomarkers and identify novel molecules with prognostic values, as well as to help further clarify the pathogenesis of the disease.</p><p>Previously, we applied a CSF proteomics approach using 2D-gel electrophoresis and mass spectrophotometry and identified differentially expressed proteins and affected cellular pathways among MS cases with different clinical phenotypes and non-MS controls [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. Here, using a machine learning-based algorithm, we re-analysed the initial proteomics data of this MS cohort, identifying potential prognostic biomarkers of poor prognosis after a follow-up period of 8.2±2.2 years. Additionally, we examined the clinical and MRI characteristics at disease onset that are associated with long-term disability outcomes. Finally, we measured CSF levels of the identified candidate protein markers in an independent MS cohort with a 6.4±2.6-year follow-up period after the diagnosis.</p><h2>Materials and methods</h2><h3>Prospective MS cohort and clinical data collection</h3><p>A total of 94 MS patients were included in this study. The patients were diagnosed according to the McDonald 2005 or 2010 criteria [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>] based on the date of their diagnosis and were retrospectively confirmed that all fulfilled the McDonald 2017 criteria [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. All patients were diagnosed and have been followed in the Neurology Department of Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa School of Medicine. The Ethics Committee of Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa approved the study (approval number: 930211, 2009), and each individual provided an informed consent form prior to inclusion in the study. The inclusion criteria were patients with 1) at least 5 years of follow-up and 2) proteomic data obtained in our previous study [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. The following information was recorded for each patient: age, sex, follow-up period, initial diagnosis, diagnosis at the last visit, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score at the time of spinal tap, EDSS score at the last visit, age-related MS severity (ARMSS) score based on the last follow-up, oligoclonal band pattern, IgG index, lesion localisation at disease onset, and symptom at disease onset. Assessment of lesion localisation included cerebral lesion load (the number of T2 lesions ≤9 vs. &gt;9), optic nerve involvement, brainstem lesions, spinal cord lesions, and multifocal involvement. Symptoms at disease onset were categorised into sensory symptoms, motor symptoms, gait disturbance, optic neuritis, diplopia and other brainstem symptoms, bladder/bowel symptoms, and Lhermitte’s sign. Based on prognosis, the patients were divided into two groups: the favourable course group consisted of patients with an ARMSS score lower than 5 (N = 67), and patients with an ARMSS score equal to or higher than 5 were assigned to the unfavourable course group (N = 27). Each parameter was compared between the two groups to reveal possible associations of demographic, clinical, and radiological findings with prognosis.</p><h3>Machine learning-based genetic algorithm</h3><p>A machine learning-based genetic algorithm was used to search for algorithmic rules that can be predictive of MS prognosis based on CSF proteomic data obtained at the time of diagnosis consisting of 151 differentially expressed proteins identified through 2D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. Genetic algorithm is a search and optimisation technique that is based on principles of Darwinian evolution [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>] and is suitable for problems with a large number of continuous as well as categorical variables. The algorithm works by starting with randomly generated hypotheses to explain a target variable, applying mutation and crossover to these hypotheses and testing each one of them with a user-defined fitness function. We used a genetic algorithm software package developed by Bilge et al., which allows pre-processing, visualising datasets, and selecting different fitness functions [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>]. The system converts continuous-valued inputs into a desired number of categories by grouping them into an equal number of samples in each category or using cut-off values provided by users. The programme automatically selects and allows users to set the total number of hypotheses and the number of hypotheses that survive to the next generation, as well as mutation and crossover rates. Based on the study design, higher sensitivity or specificity can be achieved by selecting the appropriate fitness function for the genetic algorithm. In this study, the system was used to generate several rules that differentiate the favourable and unfavourable course patient groups, yielding varying sensitivity and specificity values. For each rule, we identified patients who were not covered by the rule either as false positives or false negatives.</p><h3>Verification MS cohort and ELISA assays</h3><p>CSF levels of A2M, apo-AI, and CD36 proteins that were identified by the genetic algorithm approach were measured in an independent verification MS cohort by ELISA. Additionally, CSF haptoglobin level was measured since there was a significant difference in its initial CSF level between the favourable and unfavourable groups of the prospective MS cohort and due to its relevance to MS as shown by previous studies. The inclusion criteria for the verification cohort were patients 1) whose CSF samples were collected at the time of the first episode before the initiation of any treatment at least 5 years before the experiments; 2) who had been followed up until the experiments to allow the calculation of ARMSS scores based on the last follow-up; and 3) who agreed to participate in the study. Patients whose CSF samples were analysed in our previous study were excluded from the analysis. Among eligible patients, we selected 40 patients with the longest follow-up period (6.4±2.6 years): 20 in the favourable course group (ARMSS score &lt;5) and 20 in the unfavourable course group (ARMSS score ≥5). Proteins were measured using ELISA kits (A2M, ab108883, Abcam; apo-AI, ab108803, Abcam; CD36, ab267614, Abcam; haptoglobin, E-EL-H6078, Elabscience) according to the manufacturers’ protocols. All samples were measured in duplicate. Protein levels were compared between the groups by Student’s t-test.</p><h3>Statistical analyses</h3><p>Continuous variables are presented as means and standard deviations (SD), and categorical variables are presented as numbers and percentages. For continuous variables, differences in mean values between the study groups were compared using the Student’s t-test. For categorical variables, differences in proportions between the study groups were compared using Fisher’s exact test. P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 Version 8.4.3, and bar plots were drawn using matplotlib library in Python 3.9.</p><h2>Results</h2><h3>Clinical characteristics associated with long-term prognosis</h3><p>Demographic and clinical characteristics of the prospective MS cohort are given in <a href=\"#pone-0287463-t001\">Table 1</a>. The mean follow-up period was 8.2±2.2 years. There were no significant differences in age, sex, or follow-up period between the favourable and unfavourable course groups. Although statistically insignificant, patients with poor prognosis tended to have a higher oligoclonal band pattern positivity (96% vs. 77.4%, P = 0.06), while the mean IgG index was similar between the groups (P = 0.21). The EDSS score at the time of spinal tap and at the last visit, as well as the ARMSS score calculated based on the last follow-up, were significantly higher in the unfavourable course group (P&lt;0.0001 for all, indicating that the two groups were well-divided based on the disability statuses of the patients). The percentage of patients with high cerebral lesion load at disease onset was significantly higher in the unfavourable course group than in the favourable course group (25.9% vs. 7.6%, respectively, P = 0.04), while the percentage of those with optic nerve involvement evident on initial MRI was significantly higher in the favourable course group than in the unfavourable course group (39.4% vs. 7.4%, respectively, P = 0.002, <a href=\"#pone-0287463-t001\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#pone-0287463-g001\">Fig 1A</a>). Each symptom at disease onset was compared between the groups; optic neuritis was associated with a favourable outcome (P = 0.004), while gait disturbance (P = 0.04) and bladder/bowel symptoms (P = 0.01) were higher in the unfavourable course group (<a href=\"#pone-0287463-t001\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#pone-0287463-g001\">Fig 1B</a>). After diagnosis, 80.8% of the patients in the favourable course group and 100% of the patients in the unfavourable course group received a disease-modifying therapy (P = 0.026). This difference is expected and compatible with clinical practise, considering that the initial clinical and radiological characteristics of the patients who later fall into the unfavourable course group would lead to a higher frequency of immediate disease-modifying therapy initiation by physicians. Disease-modifying drugs do not have an effect on CSF protein levels measured in this study since all CSF samples were collected prior to treatment initiation.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>Fisher’s exact test. *, P&lt;0.05; **, P&lt;0.01.</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287463.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287463.g001</a></p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287463.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287463.t001</a></p><h3>Genetic algorithm approach reveals candidate CSF proteins associated with long-term prognosis</h3><p>We found several rules explaining poor prognosis using the initial CSF proteomics data of the prospective MS cohort. Two rules with varying sensitivity and specificity values are detailed in <a href=\"#pone-0287463-t002\">Table 2</a>. We have selected rule 2 to verify its predictive value of MS prognosis in an independent MS cohort, although we obtained a number of other rules having better sensitivity but containing proteins that were not properly identified by mass spectrometry (e.g., uncharacterized peptides) in the former study, or there were no available protein measurement assays for some proteins involved in those rules. Therefore, we tested rule 2 since we were able to identify and quantify all the proteins involved in the rule, which also showed a strong specificity.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287463.t002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287463.t002</a></p><h3>CSF protein measurement of candidate biomarkers in a verification MS cohort</h3><p>The mean follow-up period of the verification cohort was 6.4±2.6 years. Patients in the unfavourable course group had significantly higher ARMSS scores than those in the favourable course group based on the last follow-up (7.0±1.7 vs. 1.7±0.9, P&lt;0.0001). CSF A2M and apo-AI levels were significantly higher in patients with unfavourable course than in patients with favourable course (P = 0.0015 and P = 0.0016, respectively, <a href=\"#pone-0287463-g002\">Fig 2A and 2B</a>), while CD36 levels were not different between the two groups (<a href=\"#pone-0287463-g002\">Fig 2C</a>). The difference in CD36 level was still insignificant when three outlier values were excluded from the analysis. CSF haptoglobin level was not significantly different between the two groups; however, when two outlier values were excluded from the analysis, the difference became significant (P = 0.0003, <a href=\"#pone-0287463-g002\">Fig 2D</a>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec3.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec3.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>Two-tailed Student’s t-test; P&lt;0.05, significant.

Currently, long-term prognostic predictors of MS course in the early disease stages are mainly clinical and radiological findings. Although available data can provide insights into a general prediction for each patient’s prognosis to some extent, there is an evident need for a laboratory tool that can more reliably measure the probability of a patient developing the progressive phase during the disease course. Given that the efficacy, risk, and side effect profiles of each drug vary and that treatment options have been increasing in MS treatment, such laboratory biomarkers that help in treatment decisions based on the progression risk of patients are highly desirable. Moreover, MS treatment can be ceased in some patients who do not develop the progressive disease after a clinical age cut-off in light of those clinical and radiological parameters in a patient-specific manner. This decision should also be supported by a laboratory assessment that can further indicate that progression is no longer a risk factor for the patient in these cases. In this context, the measurement of serum and CSF neurofilament light chain levels has been increasingly studied and seems to be a strong candidate biomarker of ongoing and possibly upcoming neurodegeneration [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. Recently, glial fibrillary acid protein has also been shown to be a promising candidate prognostic marker in MS [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. Here, using a genetic algorithm, we provide additional candidate biomarkers of poor prognosis that can be measured in CSF samples of patients at the diagnosis stage. The genetic algorithm approach is highly suitable for medical data mining tasks as opposed to black box approaches, where neural networks are able to learn from data but cannot provide explanations. Genetic algorithm rules can be tailored for higher sensitivity or specificity depending on the requirement, and the rules can be further analysed in terms of false negative and false positive numbers. Regarding the disability measure, we grouped the patients based on their ARMSS scores. ARMSS was developed by Manouchehrinia et al. using disability data from three population-based cohorts and ranking EDSS scores based on the patients’ age at the time of assessment [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. We used the ARMSS measure rather than the last EDSS or MS Severity Score (MSSS) to obtain more comprehensive disability status information instead of a snapshot view since the ARMSS score, calculated based on age, was shown to be a slightly better disability indicator than the MSSS, calculated based on disease duration [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. Given the presence of the subclinical MS stage with varying periods, we preferred the age-based disability measure since disease duration might be a somewhat vague parameter for such calculations.</p><p>Among the identified candidate proteins, A2M, a protease inhibitor and cytokine transporter, has been previously implicated in MS. Tenorio-Laranga et al. showed that serum activated A2M level was significantly lower in clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), primary progressive MS (PPMS), and secondary progressive MS (SPMS) cases compared with healthy controls [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]. On the other hand, in a proteomic analysis by Bijak et al., blood platelet A2M was found to be increased in SPMS patients compared with healthy controls [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>], in accordance with our current findings showing a higher initial CSF A2M level in patients with worsened disability over time. Moreover, transformed A2M level was found to be elevated in serum samples of PPMS and SPMS cases compared with controls with other neurological diseases, while total A2M levels did not show a significant difference [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]. There are also a number of earlier studies showing differences in isoelectric points of CSF, serum, and plasma A2M protein in MS or MS subgroups. Serum A2M level was also shown to be elevated in preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and associated with a significantly higher risk of progression to clinical symptoms, reflecting early neuronal injury [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. By expression-based analyses, the authors further revealed that <em>SLIT2</em>, which is involved in the regulation of blood-brain barrier permeability, was one of the genes in the A2M network. Considering that the highly multifunctional A2M protein can influence a broad range of biological processes and binds to a wide range of ligands, including cytokines, we believe that an altered level or function of A2M has importance in MS pathophysiology and progression, possibly through changes in the blood-brain barrier permeability. Although the studies of A2M in MS differ in the sample type (i.e., CSF, plasma, serum, or blood platelets) and protein form (i.e., native, activated, or total), study results indicate that the protein may have functional importance in MS, and elucidating the molecular mechanisms in which different A2M forms are involved may have importance in MS pathophysiology and prognosis.</p><p>Apo-AI is a major protein component of high-density lipoproteins, mainly involved in lipid metabolism, with other functions such as immunity, inflammation, and apoptosis. Although Apo-AI is synthesised in the liver and intestine, it enters the brain through the choroid plexus and is thus associated with many neurological conditions. Previous research has shown that higher serum apo-AI levels correlate with lower grey matter and cortical volume loss and a lower conversion rate to SPMS during the 5-year follow-up period [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>]. On the contrary, we found a higher CSF apo-AI level in patients with an unfavourable disease course in this study. It was shown that apo-AI exerts anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and TNFa [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>]. Lower CSF apo-AI levels in patients with a favourable course in our cohort may be linked to a lower degree of suppression of these pro-inflammatory cytokines by apo-AI, resulting in a more inflammatory disease phase as expected in relapsing-active MS. The discrepancy may be due to the different types of samples studied; further research is needed to elucidate the association of apo-AI with MS progression.</p><p>Haptoglobin is produced by hepatocytes and binds to free haemoglobin, mainly playing an oxidative stress blocker role [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>], with a diverse range of functions including antioxidation and regulation of the immune system. In our study, CSF haptoglobin showed an increase in the unfavourable course group, suggesting a prognostic indication for worsening disability. In a previous study, a higher CSF haptoglobin level was observed in neuromyelitis optica (NMO) patients compared with MS cases and patients with other neurological diseases (OND), and CSF haptoglobin level and index were also significantly positively correlated with EDSS in NMO cases, similar to that observed in our MS cohort [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>]. While CSF haptoglobin levels were similar between MS and OND in this analysis, another study revealed a significant increase in CSF haptoglobin level in MS compared with OND [<a href=\"#pone.0287463.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>]. Given the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative functions of haptoglobin, initial CSF haptoglobin levels in patients with worsened disability over time might have increased in response to increased oxidative stress—known to be strongly associated with neurodegeneration—as a compensatory mechanism. Increased CSF haptoglobin levels have also been observed in traumatic brain injury, AD, and Guillain-Barre syndrome, suggesting that increased CSF haptoglobin is not specific to MS pathophysiology but may have long-term prognostic value for MS.</p><p>One limitation of our study is the relatively small sample size due to the absence of the clinical data of some of the patients from the original cohort who have stopped attending their routine follow-up appointments. Second, we were unable to test better genetic algorithm rules regarding sensitivity, either because some proteins were not properly identified by mass spectrometry in our previous study or because there were no specific assays available to measure their absolute values. Lastly, the correlation between CSF protein levels and clinical parameters other than ARMSS scores could not be performed since the sample sizes of related patient subgroups were small and thus would lead to unreliable results.</p><p>In conclusion, we provide novel candidate CSF protein biomarkers—as well as clinical and radiological parameters that are compatible with the literature—at the initial stages of clinical MS that may predict long-term disability outcomes in MS patients. Confirming these data in larger MS cohorts, preferably with longer follow-up periods and in different sample types of patients, as well as correlating them with other suggested prognostic predictors, such as novel MRI findings, optical coherence tomography, and serological biomarkers (e.g., serum neurofilament light chain and GFAP), may contribute to improved treatment decision-making in MS.</p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>We thank Prof. Michael Lenardo for providing us with ELISA kits for alpha-2-macroglobulin, apo-AI, and CD36.</p><h2>References</h2><h3>Subject Areas <div id=\"subjInfo\">?</div>\\n    <div id=\"subjInfoText\">\\n      <p>For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/PLOS/plos-thesaurus/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link opens in new window\">here</a>.</p>\\n      <span class=\"inline-intro\">We want your feedback.</span> Do these Subject Areas make sense for this article?

In traditional U.S. fisheries management, total commercial harvest is indirectly managed by limiting how many vessels are able to harvest the resource by limiting the number of licenses, implementing maximum per-trip catch levels, opening and closing seasons for different species, requiring or forbidding particular types of gear, and other controls of fishing effort [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>]. These approaches to management effectively raise the cost of effort in order to limit it. In contrast, fisheries management with catch shares directly manages harvest by dividing the total harvest into separate quotas that exclusively harvested by individuals or groups with much fewer restrictions on fishing effort. As a result, fishers can focus on economic efficiency, i.e., maximizing revenues while minimizing costs. Hence, while both forms of regulation can achieve biological goals (resource sustainability), catch shares are much better at capturing economic value for society from a renewable resource [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>].</p><p>Among the most economically efficient of catch shares are individual transferable quotas (ITQs) [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>]. Economists have demonstrated conceptually and empirically that introducing ITQs into fisheries rationalizes them, i.e., reduces excessive fishing effort and redundant investment thereby increasing productivity and hence economic profitability. In the U.S., fisheries that have been able to increase profitability following the introduction of ITQs include Alaskan halibut [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>], West Coast groundfish [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>], and Gulf of Mexico red snapper [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>].</p><p>In the southeast U.S., two otherwise very similar fisheries operate under two very different management regimes. Their similarity in all but management allow us to explore the divergent economic behavior and outputs that derive from them. The South Atlantic Snapper-Grouper fishery and the Gulf of Mexico Reef Fish fishery are geographically adjacent, utilize the same vessel and gear, catch the same species complex, are integrated into the same regional and national markets for inputs and outputs, and are both under U.S. federal management oversight (and the same data collection regime). However, the two different regional fisheries management councils have taken completely different approaches to management. The Snapper-Grouper fishery is intensely managed by traditional regulations while the Reef Fish fishery has been mostly transitioned to ITQs.</p><p>We wish to add to the empirical literature by carefully comparing these two fisheries from an economic perspective. Using detailed landings and revenue data from logbooks together with trip-level and annual, vessel-level economic survey data, we develop financial statement for each fishery to estimate cost structures, profits, and resource rent. These detailed economic measures allow us to contrast the economic performance of these fisheries and to illustrate the detrimental effects of the regulations on the S. Atlantic Snapper-Grouper fishery; as well as to quantify the difference in economic outcomes, including estimating the difference in resource rent generated. We take a slightly different perspective from much of the empirical literature on resource rent, in that our primary focus is on the inefficiencies brought about in the traditionally managed fishery rather than focusing on the efficiency gains of a fishery that transitioned to an ITQ [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>].</p><h2>Materials and methods</h2><h3>Discussion of framing of rents / brief literature review</h3><p>Here, we define a commercial fishery that has achieved a state where overall fishing activity only covers business costs and opportunity costs as lacking resource rents [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>]. We define any profits beyond business and opportunity costs as fishery rents. Our analysis below will use these definitions to illustrate the impact of traditional regulations and ITQs on two similar fisheries.</p><p>The ability of an economy to extract resource rents from fisheries has long been a concern of resource economists. Businesses tend to focus on profits, but some profits are expected even in industries that lack significant barriers to entry (beyond the capital and skills required to enter a market). Many economists that study fisheries assume that for society to maximize the value of natural resources—a “gift of nature”—those resources should be extracted in a way that minimizes costs [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>]. If a natural resource is privately owned, that may well occur, but commonly owned resources are a different story [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>].</p><p>There are several significant barriers to extracting resource rents from commonly owned renewable resources (as most all wild caught fisheries are). The first is the long established susceptibility of fishery stocks to overexploitation [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. This is a standard commons-type problem, with individual fishermen perhaps not intending to extract from the stock to the point of diminishing returns, but the lack of incentives to manage jointly leading to that result overall. To a large extent, the point of fishery management is to prevent that overexploitation from occurring [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>].</p><p>Unfortunately, a second barrier to extracting potential rents from fishery stocks may well be the fisheries management process itself. There are a number of potential ways to limit overfishing by commercial fishermen. Limiting entry is certainly one of those, but even a limited-entry fishery will not necessarily lead to an efficient outcome because the commons problem still exists for the current participants [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>].</p><p>In fact, regulated open access can lead to additional inefficiencies [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. Additional management measures may include putting up obstacles to rational fishing behavior, such as limiting the harvest of particular species on each vessel or trip, limiting the use of the most efficient fishing gears, limiting fishing seasons, creating closed areas, and other restrictions that managers develop to make the business of fishing less profitable and hence less palatable. An unregulated fishery will eventually drive down harvest to the point that fishermen will only pursue the species to the point of covering their business costs and opportunity costs. A regulated, limited entry fishery may do the same, although at a higher harvest level and with better protection of the underlying stock [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. In either case, the regulations restrict options and hence lead to inefficiencies.</p><p>Contrasting systems have many names: rights based, market-based, rationalized, catch shares, ITQs, individual fishing quotas. They have in common that harvest is exclusively assigned to certain actors, thereby deterministically achieving a set quota (short of cheating, of course). The resource economics literature on the effects of ITQs on fisheries is vast. Researchers have noted the effects of ITQs on sustainability [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>], communities [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>], safety [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>], equality [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>], and diversification [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>]. Some of the social effects of ITQs can be negative, but our intention here is not to add another case study of the effects of ITQs, but instead to demonstrate the inefficiencies of standard regulations by contrasting them with a neighboring alternative rights-based management system.</p><h3>The fisheries of the snapper-grouper species complexes in the Southeast U.S.</h3><p>The U.S. federal law decentralizes much of its fisheries management by handing management to regional fishery management councils (FMC). While the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and its parent the U.S. Department of Commerce retain the ultimate responsibility for preventing overfishing, the FMCs debate and choose most of the actual regulations after consulting with their scientific advisory committees [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>]. In the southeast U.S., the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) and Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (GFMC) are responsible for federal fisheries management. The SAFMC is responsible for managing fishing in federal waters from the North Carolina-Virginia border to the bottom of the Florida Keys, and the GFMC oversees the federal waters from the Keys border to the Texas border with Mexico (<a href=\"#pone-0287250-g001\">Fig 1</a>). The two areas are mostly at the same latitudes (although the SAFMC jurisdiction stretches further north), share similar weather (and hurricanes), are culturally similar, and are split by the Florida peninsula. The state of Florida is represented on both the SAFMC and GFMC. Most commercially valuable species found in one area are also present in the other, although the size of the stocks varies due to topography and ecology. The Gulf of Mexico area is both larger and contains a larger, shallower continental shelf.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec2.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>Map created by Megan Slemons, Emory Center for Digital Scholarship.</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.g001</a></p><p>In both regions, commercial fishermen harvest the snapper-grouper species complex often associated with bottom structures; also known as reef fish. Species include over 40 different snappers, groupers, tilefishes, and others. These fish are not the economically dominant species in either region as shrimp, lobsters and crabs, as well as other finfish, e.g., menhaden, make up the large majority of the seafood produced in lbs and dollar terms [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>].</p><p>The commercial reef fish fisheries in both regions are also conducted in a similar manner. Vessels are very similar—around 35 feet in total length, built of fiberglass in the late 1980s, with about 400 horsepower engines, and using ice as refrigerant. They use the same type of gear, predominantly vertical lines, including hand lines, electric reels, and bandit gear. The next biggest gear groups in both regions are bottom longlines and diving. Also, very important from an economic perspective, the two fisheries are embedded in the same markets. The markets for fish extends throughout the region and the nation, with dealers regularly shipping to NY. Also, fuel, labor, gear, and vessels are all sourced from the same southeast U.S. market, with prices matching and fluctuating together.</p><p>In fact, the two fisheries are so similar, the managers and fishery scientists refer to these two fisheries by different names to help keep them apart. In the SAT, the species complex is usually referred to as snapper-grouper while in the GOM this complex is called reef fish. For the remainder of the paper, we will follow this convention and abbreviate “South Atlantic Snapper-Grouper” as SAT SG and “Gulf of Mexico Reef Fish” as GOM RF.</p><p>Managing these reef fish fisheries is biologically and technically complex. It is biologically complex because many aspects of their life cycles make them particularly susceptible to overfishing. Some species live for decades and do not mature until they are several years old, and some are sequential hermaphrodites (beginning life as males and maturing into females later in life). Fisheries that disproportionately target larger fish, either because of desirability or regulations (i.e., minimum size limits), will disproportionately affect the reproductive capacity of the entire stock. Another complication is that reef fish that are caught in waters deeper than approximately 100 feet will suffer barotrauma when quickly brought to the survey. This increases the discard mortality for caught fish that are released due to being the wrong size or out-of-season species (regulatory discards). This problem is compounded by the inability of fishermen to selectively target many of the individual species as they cohabitate the same ecosystem. Most reef fish are also considered tasty fare and in high demand from both commercial and recreational fishermen. Overall, reef fish stocks are easy to target and easy to overfish, difficult to select for, face a high discard mortality rate, and are easier to find in recent decades due to the advent of fish finders and GPS technology (storing and finding reefs or structure precisely).</p><p>The GMFC and SAFMC have faced these challenges simultaneously. Beginning in the late 1980s, federal fisheries management in the U.S. began moving from an emphasis on commercial harvesting to biological sustainability [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>]. While the GFMC Reef Fish Fishery Management Plan and the SAFMC Snapper-Grouper Fishery Management Plan both date to the mid 1980s, the Councils only began seriously regulating, i.e., restricting, the reef fish fisheries in the 1990s. This included the passage of various size limitations and then a new commercial license moratorium passed by the GFMC in 1996 and the SAFMC in 1997, limiting access to new fishers. The SAFMC started the first ITQ for finfish in the U.S. in 1993 for the wreckfish fishery, but has not passed another since [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>].</p><p>After experiencing many of the problems with ever increasing regulations (short mini-seasons, derby fishing, high size limits and much discarding), the GFMC started its first ITQ for red snapper in 2007 [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>], and has since started another for 13 species of groupers and tilefish [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>]. With the introduction of ITQ for red snapper, the GFMC removed the management by seasons and closures but also reduced the size limit, and instituted a big quota cut (which was reversed fairly quickly as the stock recovered). The majority of revenue from the GOM RF fishery now comes from species managed under ITQs, as we will describe below. In contrast, the SAT SG fishery is managed entirely with traditional regulations.</p><p>Golden tilefish provides a useful practical example of the difference between the two management regimes in the two adjoining regions. In the GOM RF fishery, the commercial quotas for ITQ-managed species are annually converted into pounds and split among the quota owners proportionately to their share of the total quota, so a quota owner with 1% of the quota for tilefish, for example, is eligible to catch poundage equivalent to that portion of the overall quota or (alternatively) lease it to another vessel for its use. All commercial vessels harvesting tilefish thus need a limited-access reef fish permit and can either lease tilefish quota allocation (valid for a year) or permanently purchase tilefish shares (that annually spawn quota allocation) from others in the ITQ program (if they were not allocated them at the start of the program). The quota allocation applies to any of the tilefish species caught on the trip, and non-tilefish species co-caught on the trip (generally yellowedge grouper) will require a separate quota of its own (deepwater complex quota). There are some gear restrictions, but most vessels will use the most efficient gear (bottom longline) as the species lives in deeper waters. The fishery is year-round, and vessels can time their trips to balance the freshness of the harvest with expected demand and the variable and opportunity costs incurred on trips of varying lengths.</p><p>On the other side of Florida in the SAT SG fishery, the commercial tilefish quota is divided into a hook and line component (for all fishers possessing a limited entry snapper-grouper permit) and a longline component (for fishers possessing one of 23 vessels possessing an additional golden tilefish endorsement). Regulations are designed to slow the overall harvest. The hook and line catch of golden tilefish is limited to 500 lbs per trip, and when that portion of the quota is met, the fishery is closed until the following year. In 2020, that portion of the fishery closed on July 23rd. This is still longer than the longline component, as their fishery was closed on February 18th as a precautionary measure; despite a 4000 lbs trip limit. After the quota was found not to have been met, their season was reopened for nine additional days on March 14th, then closed until January 2021. Golden tilefish from the Gulf is available year round, but the same species is only available until mid-year from the South Atlantic, and suffers from pulses and surges as fishermen race to catch as much as possible before the closures begin.</p><h3>Ethics statement</h3><p>Economic surveys of commercial fishermen were approved by the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as part of NOAA’s regulatory authority. As with landings data, survey results tied to individual fishermen are considered confidential data and can be released only after aggregating to include at least three participants. Aggregated data can be found at the NOAA repositories at <a href=\"https://repository.library.noaa.gov/\">https://repository.library.noaa.gov/</a>.</p><h3>Data</h3><p>For our comparative analysis, we use fisheries logbook and economic data from NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service’s (NMFS) Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC). Since 1993, the SEFSC has required all fishing vessels to report on their commercial fishing activity for federally managed species, including the SAT SG and GOM RF fisheries. Fishers must complete and submit a trip report (logbook) for every fishing trip to remain compliant with their federal fishing permits. The fishing logbooks are nearly a complete census of landings and effort in the federally managed commercial fisheries in the southeast U.S. To estimate revenue at the trip level (i.e., for each logbook), we multiply the logbook’s landings poundage by the most appropriate price available from the dealer landings data summarized in the SEFSC’s Accumulated Landings System (ALS). An algorithm matches dealer, state, month, and year between logbooks and ALS records for each species at the highest resolution possible.</p><p>Since 2006, SEFSC economists have conducted two economic surveys to collect economic data at both the trip-level and annual, vessel-level to complement the logbook data. The economic surveys are designed to provide data that in turn can produce fishery-level financial statements; to measure and track the economic developments in these federally-managed fisheries.</p><p>Each year, a random stratified sample of permitted vessels is selected to provide trip-level economic information. Selection eligibility is based on whether a vessel has a valid federal permit of interest during late November of the previous year. Approximately 30% of active vessels and 10% of inactive vessels are randomly sampled. For each fishing trip, selected vessels must complete the trip expense section located at the bottom of the trip report form. These variable cost questions include expenses for bait, ice, groceries, and IFQ leasing (paying to use another vessel’s shares); the amount of fuel used and the cost per gallon of fuel; whether or not the vessel owner was present on the trip, and whether or not payment for the catch was determined. If payment was determined, then gross trip revenue and payment to hired crew and hired captain are collected (<a href=\"#pone-0287250-g002\">Fig 2</a>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.g002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.g002</a></p><p>Early in the following year, selected vessels are mailed an annual expense survey (<a href=\"#pone.0287250.s001\">S1 Fig</a>). This survey elicits annual, vessel-holistic economic data. The primary purpose of the annual expense survey is to collect fixed costs. These expenses include the costs for maintaining and repairing the vessel and gear, insurance, loan payments, and overhead (such as mooring, utilities, office staff, professional services, etc.). Because vessels often engage in (non-federal) fisheries not in the logbook system, or engage in for-hire fishing, the survey also asks for annual cumulative trip-level expenses such as fuel, supplies, and hired crew payments for a complete picture of the annual, vessel-level expenses. To allow for comparison to the trip-level reporting and to help assign shares of fixed costs, the survey also collects the number of days at sea and total revenue for commercial and for-hire fishing. Finally, it collects an estimate of the vessel’s market value as proxy for the capital invested.</p><p>The surveys involve three rounds of mail-outs, reminder calls, many call-backs, and send-backs when call-backs fail. Response rates are generally high by fishery standards. In 2016, the raw response rate at the trip-level was 98% and 99% in the SAT SG and GOM RF fisheries, respectively. The annual, vessel-level raw response rate was 77% and 88%, respectively.</p><p>Many call-backs to respondents are necessary for getting missing values, clarifications, or validating outlier or odd numbers. Only records that are complete in all the financial fields can be used for generating the financial statements, i.e., item non-response cannot be tolerated for most questions. As a result, when counting only observations used in the analysis, the effective response rates drop to 94% and 94% at the trip-level and 71% and 82% at the annual, vessel-level for the SAT SG and GOM RF fisheries, respectively. Missing trip-level revenue or hired crew costs (these questions cannot always be answered by all fishers at the time the logbook is completed) are replaced with the estimated revenue from the logbook and a regression-based estimate of crew costs, respectively. Once the economic data is complete, a careful accounting exercise begins.</p><p>Two economically relevant values are not collected on the surveys and are instead estimated for each trip or vessel. At the trip-level, the opportunity cost of the owner-operator’s time as captain is estimated based on hired crew compensation and profitability (due to share systems). At the vessel-level, vessel depreciation is simply calculated at 5% of the vessel’s current market value. The resulting number is a rough estimate, identical to that used in the federal Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery where depreciation is based on surveys and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service requires non-fishing vessels to be depreciated over 23 years.</p><p>This paper’s comparative analysis of the economics of the SAT SG and GOM RF fisheries builds on earlier technical memoranda [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>]. Each report provides economic results for a specific subsets of the overall logbook and survey data, such as for the SAT SG or GOM RF fishery. Participation in a fishery is defined as catching at least one pound of the applicable species on a trip in the applicable waters, e.g., in the SAT or GOM. As sampling is at the vessel-level, prior to the fishing year, post-stratification is used to statistically estimate appropriate population means for the elements in the fishery financial statements (separately at the trip-level and at the annual, vessel-level, as they are effectively two different data streams). All vessel and logbook trip data utilized in this report were pulled from the various databases on May 4, 2018. All dollar values are in nominal 2016 USD.</p><h2>Results</h2><p>Aggregating the census-level logbook data specific to each fishery reveals some important distinctions between the patterns of the fishing in the two regions (<a href=\"#pone-0287250-t001\">Table 1</a>). The first is the relative size of the each fishery as the total landings in gutted-weight pounds in the GOM RF fishery are nearly three times those in the SAT SG one. The Gulf of Mexico is a larger area in terms of geography and habitat as the reef species are caught on the continental shelf and preferably in shallower waters. To account for the difference in scale of these two fisheries, we calculate the ratio of measures in the SAT SG fishery over the GOM RF fishery and then adjust for the difference in pounds (divide by 0.35), i.e., we prorate appropriately for a more legitimate comparison.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.t001</a></p><p>For instance, revenues are higher in the GOM RF fishery and not just due to higher landings. The data shows that on average fishers in the GOM RF fishery received a higher price per pound (+$0.74). This implies that SAT SG fishers receive just 82% of revenue per pound of fish landed compared to the GOM RF fishers. Despite its much smaller catch, the SAT SG fleet is approximately the same size as the GOM RF one. When adjusted for pounds caught, the SAT SG fleet contains almost three times as many vessels as the GOM RF fleet. Even starker is the divergence in the number of trips taken in each fishery. For a given amount of landings, the SAT SG fleet takes almost five times more trips than the GOM RF one. It is also worth noting that the SAT SG fishery uses 29% more labor per unit of landings than the GOM RF fishery.</p><p>Looking at 2016 fishing trips (<a href=\"#pone-0287250-t002\">Table 2</a>), we see that GOM RF trips are much longer; averaging 4.4 days at sea compared to 1.7 days of SAT SG trips. On these longer trips, with a somewhat larger crew, Gulf fishers on average land more than four and a half times as much, 2,262 pounds vs. 499 pounds, as fishers in the SAT SG fishery. Trip limits in the SAT SG fishery are leading to much shorter trips than would otherwise be taken. Regulations for most of the major commercial fishing species in the SAT SG fishery are intended to extend fishing opportunities, i.e., preventing very short seasons, by imposing trip limits.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.t002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.t002</a></p><p><a href=\"#pone-0287250-g003\">Fig 3</a> shows two scatter plots of trips landing vermilion snapper, a major species, especially in the SAT SG fishery. The top and bottom plots are for the GOM RF and SAT SG fisheries, respectively. Each trip is plotted relative to the scale of vermilion snapper revenue (X-axis; in $) and the specialization on vermilion snapper of the trip (Y-axis; in % of vermilion snapper revenue of total trip revenue). When comparing the two plots, we note that the one for the GOM RF fishery lacks any major discontinuities, but the one for the SAT SG fishery has two areas where trips group up along a seeming vertical line; at approximately $2000 and $3750 in vermillion snapper revenue. This strong behavioral response caused by the step-down trip limits implemented by the SAFMC to extend the fishing year. Specifically, as the vermilion snapper quota gets closer to being reached during the year, the per-vessel trip limit for vermillion snapper steps down from 1000 lbs per trip to 500 lbs per trip (until the fleet quota is met and the season is closed).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>Distribution of trips across vermillion snapper revenue (in $) and share of revenue (in %) for the GOM RF (top) and SAT SN fisheries (bottom) in 2016.</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.g003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.g003</a></p><p>Somewhat less obvious but equally important to note in <a href=\"#pone-0287250-g003\">Fig 3</a>, is that under the GFMC’s management system relatively few trips specialize, or solely target, vermillion snapper. For most trips in the GOM RF fishery, vermillion snapper makes up less than a quarter of the revenue for the trip (&gt;70% of trips), with relatively few exceeding half (~15% of trips). In contrast, vermillion snapper trips in the SAT SG fishery derive a much bigger share of their revenue from vermilion snapper. The vermilion snapper revenue exceeds 50% on about 55% of the trips. As will be explained more below, some of the higher specialization in the SAT vs. GOM fishery is likely due to SAT SG season closures of other species.</p><p><a href=\"#pone-0287250-g004\">Fig 4</a> shows the monthly share of total revenue generated by the two fisheries. The overall harvest level in the GOM RF fishery is much more stable month-to-month than in the SAT SG fishery. In the SAT SG in 2016 months late in the year generate less than a third of the revenue of top producing months, i.e., January and May. In contrast, in the Gulf the lowest month’s revenue is still at about two-thirds of the highest month’s revenue.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.g004\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.g004</a></p><p>In the SAT SG, a pattern of the fleet running out of quota happens consistently enough across the species that constitute the majority of fishing revenue such that fishers catch noticeably less fish as the winter holiday season approaches. In <a href=\"#pone-0287250-g004\">Fig 4</a>, the last three months of the year, i.e., 25% of the year, constitute only 10% of the year’s revenue.</p><p>When we disaggregate <a href=\"#pone-0287250-g004\">Fig 4</a> by species for the SAT SG fishery the impact of seasons, closures, and derby fishing behavior becomes more apparent. <a href=\"#pone-0287250-g005\">Fig 5</a> shows the monthly share of revenue for three species/species groups. For vermilion snapper (top panel), the quota is split into two seasons, starting in January and July. As each half-year season goes into effect, nearly half of the year’s quota is caught in those two first-months after opening. With continued high landings in the following two months quota is quickly drawn down. As a result, the fishery is all but closed in April through June and again October through December. The small spike in landings at the end of 2016 is due to NMFS’s oversight of the fishery. After estimating that some quota still remained following the October closure (and data lags), the agency reopened the fishery for a few days before the end of the 2016.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.g005\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.g005</a></p><p>The middle and bottom panel of <a href=\"#pone-0287250-g005\">Fig 5</a> show the equivalent results for the deepwater species complex and the shallow-water complex of the SAT SG fishery, respectively. The deepwater season opens in January, and two-thirds of landing occur in the first quarter of the year. For the shallow-water species, a spawning season closure is in effect for the first four months of every year. The expectation of closures due to exhaustion of the quotas induces some element of derby behavior, i.e., racing to fish behavior, in the SAT SG fishery.</p><p>The use of some gear types in the SAT SG fishery correlates fairly strongly with certain species or species groups. For instance, longlines are used to catch half the deepwater complex landings, almost entirely during January through March. Diving equipment and traps are used May through October. As a result, much of this gear is idle for at least half a year. While some idle and redundant gear serves economic purposes, too much is a drain on productivity. It is also likely that the derbies and season closures are detrimental to the average ex-vessel prices fishers receive in the SAT SG fishery. Due to regulation, and unlikely to match market demand, a perishable product floods the market at times, only to disappear entirely at other times of the year (<a href=\"#pone-0287250-g005\">Fig 5</a>). At least some of the 18% lower average price in the SAT SG is likely due to these fluctuations.</p><p>Cost data also reveals substantial differences between the SAT SG and GOM RF fisheries. Based on sample trip-level data for 2016, <a href=\"#pone-0287250-t003\">Table 3</a> shows that the average GOM RF trip was far more lucrative than those taken in the SAT SG fishery; with gross revenues nearly five times as large. After accounting for trip-level economic costs, i.e., variable costs including the opportunity costs of the owner-operators’ time as captain, the GOM RF trips generate over eight times the surplus cash flow (here called trip net revenue) over SAT SG trips. While GOM RF trips are nearly three times the length of SAT SG trips and catch four times the landings, these scale measures are insufficient to explain the eight-times disparity in trip net revenues.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.t003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.t003</a></p><p>We can compare two proxies for the technical productivity of these trips by calculating the average landings pounds per gallon of fuel used and average landings per crew-day of labor employed. The GOM RF trips generate 68% more landings per gallon of fuel use (11.4/6.8) and 20% more landings per crew-day of labor employed (169/141). This indicates that the SAT SG trips are very inefficient in fuel use vs. the GOM RF trips. At the same time, while labor is employed less efficiently than in the Gulf, the difference is much less than the disparity in fuel consumption. This finding is consistent with the idea that SAT SG trip limit regulation force fishers to cut short many trips, burning more fuel as they frequently return to port to unload.</p><p>The two fleets have some differences in average trip-level production functions. While the SAT SG trips spend about twice as much (relative to revenue) on fuel and bait compared to GOM RF trips, they spend a very similar portion of revenue on groceries and miscellaneous expenditures. Ice expenditures and overall labor cost (hired crew and owner opportunity costs) as a share of revenue are about 30% higher in the SAT SG fishery. Dividing trip net revenue by total revenue generates the gross margin generated by the trip, i.e., the share of revenue available, after subtracting trip-level variable costs, to pay for fixed costs, for financing costs, for compensating the owner and invested equity, and pure profit such as resource rent. The trip-level margins are 49.7% and 28.7% for the GOM RF and SAT SG trips, respectively. A 21 percentage point difference on a margin or return in similar industries demands further explanation.</p><p>The economic trip-level results---while based on a large sample size and being indicative of the economic situation---do not provide a full or holistic view of the economic situation in each fishery. Annual surveys reveal that the average vessel in each fishery also engages in some for-hire fishing work and commercial fishing for species beyond the SAT SG and GOM RF fisheries (<a href=\"#pone-0287250-t004\">Table 4</a>). At the annual level, overall annual fishing days at sea and for-hire days at sea and revenue are similar, as is the vessel value. Costs related to the vessel, repair and maintenance, insurance, depreciation, and even overhead are also of similar magnitude. The biggest differences are the revenue from commercial fishing (more than double in the Gulf), followed by hired crew and other supply costs.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.t004\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.t004</a></p><p>There are different ways to look at profits. As our objective is a societal, economic perspective (vs. a individual business, financial perspective), we use what we call net revenue from operations. Net revenue from operations starts with operating revenue (i.e., excluding extraordinary, i.e., non-fishing, income) and subtracts all real, tangible costs of production. Beyond material inputs (fuel, repairs, etc.), the in-kind contributions to the production process must be accounted for as well. In our case, this includes the opportunity cost of owner-operator’s time spent as captain of the vessel and the vessel’s depreciation accounting for the degradation of the vessel with use and over time. Financial cost that do not represent an actual input to the production function, e.g., loan payments, IFQ purchases, or income taxes, are not counted. From a societal perspective many of these represent transfers of value generated by the fishery to others, i.e., are distributional in nature (and not our focus here).</p><p>To be more representative of the fisheries than a single year, we collapse the cost categories, express them as percent of revenue, and then average them across three years (<a href=\"#pone-0287250-t005\">Table 5</a>). We thereby generate an aggregate cost structure in percent-of-revenue terms and the economic profit margin implicit in the annual, vessel-level net revenue from operations. We will use these measures for the rest of the paper.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.t005\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.t005</a></p><p>In <a href=\"#pone-0287250-t006\">Table 6</a>, we use the 3-year average cost structure and margins from <a href=\"#pone-0287250-t005\">Table 5</a>, multiplied by the 3-year average annual fishery revenue (from <a href=\"#pone-0287250-t001\">Table 1</a>) to estimate the total annual fishery expenses in each cost category and fishery-wide total profit (net revenue from operations). Note that the SAT SG and GOM RF landings that generate the revenue displayed are never landed in isolation from other species. Similarly, fixed costs components are never specific just to these fisheries. Hence the table’s results represent an abstraction (through standardization and prorating) of complex and messy fisheries data down to the a hypothetical concept of a pure SAT SG or GOM RF fishery, respectively.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.t006\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.t006</a></p><p>Conceptually, to derive the resource rent from the net revenue from operations, it is necessary to subtract the opportunity costs of capital. The opportunity cost of capital accounts for “fair” compensation for the financial capital invested in the fishing vessel and business. For private businesses investment decisions, a large element accounts for the investment risk involved. Past studies in fisheries have assumed an opportunity cost of capital which is equal to the rate of return on a BAA rated bond, which is considered a somewhat risky bond [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>]. During the 2014–2016 time period, the rate for such bonds averaged 4.85%. For evaluating a publically-owned natural resource at the aggregate industry level, and not to penalize the more capital intensive SAT SG fishery further, we use a more conservative opportunity cost of capital of 3.5%.</p><p>We apply this rate to the total market value of the effective vessels in each fishery. To calculate the number of effective vessels, we first use the days at sea (from the annual, vessel-level surveys) to prorate the total number of vessels between commercial and for-hire fisheries. In a second step, we prorate the commercial fishery effective vessels between the fishery of interest (SAT SG or GOM RF) and any other fisheries by using the revenues from the logbooks. In this manner, we calculate that the 518 vessels (partially) active in the SAT SG, are “equivalently engaged” as 272 hypothetical vessels that are fishing—solely—for SAT SG species. We then multiply this number by the 3-year average vessel value ($82,793) to estimate the value of the capital stock ($22.5 million invested capital specific to the SAT SG fishery). 3.5% of this capital stock corresponds to the $0.8 million under opportunity cost of capital in <a href=\"#pone-0287250-t006\">Table 6</a>. The equivalent is done for the Gulf.</p><p>Our calculated resource rent is hence an approximation. First, we acknowledge that there may be some intramarginal rents (IMRs) being generated due to fleet heterogeneity [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>]. Any such IMR in the SAT SG fishery would imply a negative resource rent. In the Gulf, large resource rents (approx) have been generated since the introduction of the ITQs [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>]. In 2006, pre-ITQ, similar to the SAT SG fishery today, the substantial rent was non-existent. As the ITQ years coincided with a consolidation of vessels, it is unlikely that IMR increased during this time. Importantly, most of the different regulations in each fishery apply <em>uniformly</em> to all fishers in each fishery, i.e., they should not be a source of heterogeneity <em>within</em> the fishery.</p><p>We estimate the estimated resource rent in the GOM RF fishery between 2014–2016 in the broad range of $20 million per year or, in percent of revenue terms, over 30% of total revenue. In stark contrast, the SAT SG fishery seems to generate little or no resource rent. All the resource rents have dissipated due to the combination of an inability to limit costs or increase revenue when faced with the regulations. The difference between the two fisheries is 30% of revenue, i.e., a large fraction of total revenue. As we argued throughout the paper, the most likely culprit for this divergence in economic outcomes is the choice management regime. A sensitivity analysis on our assumptions would not change the central results due to their extreme divergence. Also, expanding the data to five years (2014–2018) makes no difference. In summary, in two fisheries with similar geography, biology, technology, and embedded in the same economic environment, the choice of management regime leads to very different economic outcomes. Specifically, the ITQ managed fishery generates substantial resource rent for society; on the order of a large fraction of revenue; while the traditionally managed fishery fails to capture most or all of the potential rents.</p><h2>Discussion</h2><p>Rather than provide analysis of any specific management action, we have attempted to calculate the cumulative economic effects of the differing management regimes used in two otherwise very similar southeast U.S. reef fisheries. We considered attempting to estimate the loss of revenue in the SAT SG resulting from the volatility of landings (due to species-specific seasons) but decided it was beyond the scope of this research as it would need to be conducted on a species-by-species basis; with sometimes thin price and market data. Nonetheless, the gluts generated by the race-to-fish when seasons open and the frequent shutdowns undoubtedly contribute negatively to the market bargaining position of the SAT SG fishers. Research on the demand for the SAT SG species, especially on how the ex-vessel prices relate to locally landed species, could be used to better predict possible gains if the SAT SG fishery was to bring product to the market in a more rational manner.</p><p>Beyond the revenue loss, the SA fishery’s resource rent dissipation is largely due to the larger-than-necessary fleet. A fleet that is larger than necessary incurs additional fixed cost and opportunity cost of capital. The burning of hundreds of thousands of gallons of additional fuel, necessitated by extra travel, dissipates millions of dollars in additional value while adding to US carbon emissions. Despite the warnings in much of the literature about the effects of ITQs on crew labor, the ratio of the number of crew days between the SAT SG and GOM RF fisheries is only 1.29 when standardized by poundage (<a href=\"#pone-0287250-t001\">Table 1</a>) and much of that additional labor is a product of constantly traveling back and forth to port. The aggregate expenditure numbers also hide the fact that the GOM RF fishery uses less labor, but pays it more.</p><p>A known, but unquantified problem in the SAT SG fishery is regulatory discarding due to season closures and size limits. At its worst, fishers might be producing additional valuable product only to discard it. Any management changes that would allow fishers to keep even some of such catch—even if the quota is fixed—would have a disproportionally big economic effect, as would any efforts by the fleet to work cooperatively to reduce bycatch [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>]. The extent of these issues in the Gulf are likewise unknown, although ITQs are hardly free of discarding and high grading problems [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>].</p><p>Beyond its detrimental effects on economic profitability, there are additional problems with the SAFMC’s consistent use of trip limits as a management tool. The effects of regulatory trip limits are also difficult to predict, as tightening or loosening trip limits causes changes in effort induced by the changes in trip efficiency [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref038\" class=\"ref-tip\">38</a>]. Hence NOAA has to take a precautionary approach to fishing seasons, closing them prematurely sometimes lest quotas be exceeded and result in shorter seasons the following year. Following a presentation of our conclusions to the SAFMC, we were also told that owner-operators sometimes spend additional funds keeping crews on payroll during closed seasons, further subtracting from commercial profits. Such payments would not be accounted for in our trip-level analysis, and it is unclear if they would be reported on the annual, vessel-level survey. Finally, there are potential spillover effects from closed fisheries, putting potential strain on other fisheries in the region.</p><p>We have not discussed the recreational fishing fleet in this paper, but the GFMC has also experimented with a separate quota for the for-hire portion of that fishing sector in an effort to increase economic benefits [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>]. The SAFMC, in contrast, has not yet limited entry into for-hire fishing, let alone separated out management of it from the general recreational angler. We have also avoided discussing safety at sea issues, although there is evidence that the Gulf’s management has resulted in improvements [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>], or compliance rates [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>].</p><p>We have also not discussed some of the potential negatives of the GMFC ITQ programs, leaving that for other authors to explore. This paper focuses on economic efficiency and rent returns as a measure of management success. The GFMC introduced ITQs into the Reef Fish fishery primarily to reduce overcapacity and eliminate derbies [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. The SAFMC has other goals for the Snapper Grouper Fishery Management Plan, including allowing consistent access across all sectors and maximizing social and economic opportunities [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>]. Researchers have raised issues with ITQs leading to a loss of local level community [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>], increasing fishermen’s dependence on particular fisheries [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>], and causing employment loss [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref045\" class=\"ref-tip\">45</a>]. Most troublesome, ITQs can cause wealth dissipation for non ITQ owners [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref046\" class=\"ref-tip\">46</a>] and promote so-called “armchair fishing” [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref047\" class=\"ref-tip\">47</a>], an accusation we have heard in about Gulf fisheries. These negative social effects may be present in the Gulf ITQ fisheries [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref048\" class=\"ref-tip\">48</a>]. The older South Atlantic wreckfish ITQ may offer a less problematic alternative, shareholders can only lease quota to other shareholders and the fishery hence many of the same equity issues that may plague the Gulf [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>].</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In summary, the SAFMC and GFMC take very different approaches to commercial fishing management. The GFMC has expanded ITQ management to most of the valuable commercial species in the GOM RF fishery, while the SAFMC continues to rely on traditional management. We find that the choice of fishery management regime shows up as a regime shift in the productivity and profitability of the fisheries. While many of our specific definitions or assumptions used in the derivation of these results could be adjusted or refined (according to each researcher’s judgement and research question focus), such changes will not eliminate the huge advantage in terms of economic performance of ITQs over traditional management.</p><p>The decision to switch to ITQs or other catch shares is a politically charged one, and many of the criticisms—enrichment of the initial shareholders of quota at the expense of future ones (and of the public, who ultimately own the resource itself) and “armchair fishing” by shareholders who lease but do not fish—are serious and proven externalities of a different sort. Our analysis here shows that the decision to utilize a traditional management approach comes with substantial economic consequences of its own. Trip limits, short seasons, and the resulting derbies—and the rational response of capital stuffing [<a href=\"#pone.0287250.ref049\" class=\"ref-tip\">49</a>]—have resulted in a renewable resource being utilized in a way that does not capture its potential economic value.</p><h2>Supporting information</h2><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.s001\">S1 Fig. </a>Annual, vessel-level economic survey instrument (mail survey).</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.s001\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287250.s001</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(TIF)</p><h2>References</h2><h3>Subject Areas <div id=\"subjInfo\">?</div>\\n    <div id=\"subjInfoText\">\\n      <p>For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/PLOS/plos-thesaurus/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link opens in new window\">here</a>.</p>\\n      <span class=\"inline-intro\">We want your feedback.</span> Do these Subject Areas make sense for this article?

The study uses generalized estimating equations (GEEs) methodology to analyze longitudinal data for sample of 20288 listed Chinese non-financial firms from the period 2018:q2-2020:q1. The main advantage of GEEs method over other estimation techniques is its ability to robustly estimate the variances of regression coefficients for data samples that display high correlation between repeated measurements. The findings of study show that the decline in cash flow measures and metrics bring significant positive improvements in the financial performance of firms. The empirical evidence suggests that performance improvement levers (i.e. cash flow measures and metrics) are more pronounced in low leverage firms, suggesting that changes in cash flow measures and metrics bring more positive changes in low leverage firms’ financial performance relatively to high leveraged firms. The results hold after mitigating endogeneity based on dynamic panel system generalized method of moments (GMM) and sensitivity analysis considering the robustness of main findings. The paper makes significant contribution to the literature related to cash flow management and working capital management.

Exercising proper management of cash flow is vital to the persistence of business [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>]. Cash flow management is primarily concerned with identifying effective policies that balance customer satisfaction and service costs [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. Firms manage efficiently of cash flows via working capital by balancing liquidity and profitability [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. Working capital management, which is the main source of firm cash flow has significant importance in the context of China, where firms are restricted with limited access to external capital markets. In order to fulfill their cash flow needs firms heavily depend on internal funds, short-term bank loans, and trade credit in order to finance their undertakings [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>]. For such firms’ working capital plays the role of additional source of finance. Consistent with this view, KPMG China [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>] declared that effective management of working capital has played a vital role to alleviate the effects of recent financial crisis. Additionally, in recent times the remarkable growth of China roots to Chinese private firms’ effective management of working capital in general and their accounts receivables in particular [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. Therefore, efficient management of working capital is an avenue that highly influence firm profitability [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>], liquidity [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>], and value. Since corporates cash flow management policies settle working capital by account receivables, inventories and accounts payables. Hence, existing theories of working capital management support the view that by cash flow manipulation firms can enhance liquidity and competitive positioning [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>]. Therefore, firms manipulate cash flows through its measures, as by way speedy recovery of accounts receivables, reducing inventories, and delaying accounts payables [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. Hence, the first research question is whether changes in cash flow measures are the tools that could bring positive changes in firm financial performance.</p><p>From the accounting perspective, liquidity management evaluates firm’s competence to cover obligations with cash flows [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>], as uncertainty about cash flow increases the risk of collapse in most regions, industries, and other subsamples [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. There are two extents: static or dynamic views, through which corporate liquidity can be inspected. The balance sheet data at some given point of time is a basis for static view. This comprises of traditional ratios such as, current ratios and quick ratios, in order to evaluate firms ability to fulfill its obligations through assets liquidation [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]. The static approach is commonly used to measure corporate liquidity, however, authors also declare that financial ratio’s static nature put off their capability to effectively measure liquidity [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>]. The dynamic view is to be utilized to capture the firms’ ongoing liquidity from firm operations [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. Therefore as a dynamic measure, the cash conversion cycle (CCC) is used by authors to measure liquidity in empirical studies of corporate performance [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>]. For instance; Zeidan and Shapir [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>] and Amponsah-Kwatiah and Asiamah [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>] find that reducing the CCC by not affecting the sales and operating margin increases share price, profits and free cash flow to equity. Accordingly, Farris and Hutchison [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>] find that shorter cash conversion cycle leads to higher present value of net cash flows generated by asset which contribute to higher firm value. Moreover, Kroes and Manikas [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>] used operating cash cycle as a measure for cash flow metrics, which combines accounts receivables and firm inventory. As explained by Churchill and Mullins [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>] that all other things being constant shorter the operating cash cycle faster the company can reassign its cash and can have growth from its internal resources. The second research question therefore is that whether changes in cash flow metrics bring positive improvements in firm financial performance.</p><p>Study uses CSMAR database of Chinese listed companies from the period 2018:q2-2020:q1. In the study, measure of firm performance is Tobin’s-q. Study uses three cash flow measures; accounts receivables turning days, inventory turning days and accounts payable turning days, and cash conversion cycle and operating cash cycle as measure for cash flow metrics. Consistent with the prediction, study finds that changes in cash flow measures and metrics bring positive improvements in firm financial performance. In particular decline in cash flow measures (ARTD, ITD, and APTD) to one unit would increase firm performance approximately 6.8%, 0.03%, and 7.2%; respectively. Additionally, one unit decline in cash conversion cycle would increase firm performance approximately 3.8%. Furthermore, study uses GMM estimator to alleviate the endogeneity and observe that the main estimation results still hold. In addition, study also employs a sensitivity analysis specifications to better isolate the impact of changes in cash flow measures and metrics on firm financial performance in previous period and observe that negative association is still sustained.</p><p>The sizable number of listed firms in China enable the study to divide sample into two subsamples: firms in high leverage industry and firms in low leverage industry. The study repeats the test on these two subsamples. Significant and negative association between cash flow measures, metrics and firm financial performance is still sustained. Moreover, the results of differential coefficients across two sub samples via seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) systems indicated that cash flow measures and metrics are more pronounced in low debt industries.</p><p>The paper makes significant contribution to the literature related to cash flow management and working capital management. First, this paper is among few to empirically study, how cash flow measures and metrics are related to firm performance from dynamic stand point especially in the Chinese context. The study sheds light on the role of cash flow management in improving the firm’s financial performance. Second, extant researches on cash flow management focus on the manufacturing industries. Unlike others this paper investigates the relation between cash flow measures, metrics and firm performance in the context of whole Chinese market, which is essential to know how these performance levers contribute to financial performance of other industries also. Third, results highlight the role of cash flow management in improving financial performance by taking firms’ leverage into consideration and declare that low leveraged industries are better off in terms of influence of changes in cash flow measures and metrics on firm performance. Fourth, the present paper uses generalized estimating equations (GEEs) Zeger and Liang [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>] technique which is robust to estimate variances of regression coefficients for data samples that display high correlation between repeated measurements. Finally, to ensure robustness of findings the study uses sensitivity analysis, and in order to control for the potential issue of endogeneity the present study also uses generalized method of moments (GMM) following statistical procedures of Arellano and Bover [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>] and Blundell and Bond [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>].</p><p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section two discusses the role of cash flow management in China. Section three discusses the relevant literature, theoretical framework and development of hypotheses. Section four presents the data and variables of the study. Section five reports the methodology, empirical results and discussions. Section six concludes the paper.</p><h2>Cash flow management in China</h2><p>The economy of China has undergone a massive economic growth rates followed by high rates of fixed investment in the past three decades [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>]. This growth miracle is outcome of highly productive firms and their ability to accrue significant cash flows [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>], despite inadequate financial system. Moreover, although Chinese economy has seen fast growth and development in the past two decades but still the legal environment in China cannot be regarded as conducive [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>]. As, in the credit market of China government plays a decisive role in credit distribution [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>], and mostly the credit is granted to companies owned by state or closely held firms [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>]. The Chinese firms have restricted admittance to the long-standing funds marketplace [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>], therefore, companies held private or non-SOE find difficulty to access credit from financial market relatively to state owned firms. Although by the 1998 leading Chinese banks were authorized to lend credit to privately held firms but still these firms face troublesome to get external finance comparatively to state owned firms [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>]. The prior literature also indorses this and states that with the presence of regulatory discrimination amid privately held and state owned firms, the privately held firms to the extent are often the subject of state predation [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref038\" class=\"ref-tip\">38</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>].</p><p>Given country’s poor financial system, firms in China have managed their growth rates from their internal resources. Working capital management from where firms manage cash flows is the source of financing of the growth by Chinese firms. Accordingly, Ding <em>et al</em>. [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>] mentioned that in their sample of Chinese firms about 66.6% dataset were characterized by a large average ratio of working capital to fixed capital, as it is a source and use of short term credit. Additionally, Dewing [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>] termed working capital as one of the vital elements of the firm along with fixed capital. Moreover, Ding <em>et al</em>. [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>] conclude that in the presence of financial constraints and cash flow shocks still Chinese firms can manage high fixed investment levels which correspond more to working capital than fixed capital. They further state that this all roots to the efficient management of working capital that Chinese firms use in order to mitigate liquidity constraints.</p><h2>Literature review, theoretical background and hypothesis development</h2><h3>Literature review and theoretical background</h3><p>Corporate finance theory states that the main goal of a corporation is to maximize shareholder wealth [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>]. Neoclassical capital theory is based on the proposition put forward by Irving Fisher [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>] that individual consumption decisions can be separated from investment decisions. Fisher’s separation theorem holds true in perfect capital markets, where companies and investors can lend and borrow on the same terms without incurring transaction costs. In such a world, the choice to change income streams by lending and borrowing to meet preferences of consumption means that investors rank income streams according to their present value. Therefore, the value of the company is maximized by choosing the set of investments that generate the largest net present value over returns. When the company pays cash dividends with capital reserves, cash dividends can be maintained at a certain level, and when the ratio of capital reserves to cash dividends is high, accrual income management is low [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>]. Since Gitman’s [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>] seminal work, in which he introduced the concept of cash circulation as a means of managing corporate working capital and its impact on firm liquidity. Richards and Laughlin [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>] then transformed the cash cycle concept into the Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) theory for analyzing the working capital management efficiency of firms. CCC theory holds that effective working capital management (i.e., shorter cash conversion cycles) will increase a company’s liquidity, all else being equal. Signal theory can illustrate how a company can provide excellent signals to users of financial and non-financial statements [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref045\" class=\"ref-tip\">45</a>]. In addition, this theory can also be used as a reference for investors to see how good or bad a company is as an investment fund. This theory explains the relationship between working capital turnover and profitability.</p><p>The trade-off theory in capital structure is a balance of benefits and sacrifices that may occur due to the use of debt [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref046\" class=\"ref-tip\">46</a>]. The higher the amount a company spends on financing its debt, the greater the risk that they will face financial hardship due to excessive fixed interest payments to debt holders each year and uncertain net income. Higher cash flow uncertainty leads to an increased risk of business collapse [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. Companies with high levels of leverage should keep their liquid assets high, as leverage increases the likelihood of financial distress. This theory is used to explain the relationship between leverage and profitability. Pecking order theory explains that companies with high liquidity levels will use more debt funds than companies with low liquidity levels [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref047\" class=\"ref-tip\">47</a>]. Liquidity measures a company’s ability to meet its cash needs to pay short-term debts and fund day-to-day operations as working capital. The better the company’s current ratio, the more the company will gain the trust of creditors so that creditors will not hesitate to lend the company funds used to increase capital, which will benefit the company.</p><p>Prevailing working capital management theories argue that firms can improve their competitive position by manipulating cash flow to improve liquidity [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref048\" class=\"ref-tip\">48</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref050\" class=\"ref-tip\">50</a>]. In addition, the company’s ability to convert materials into cash from sales reflects the company’s ability to effectively generate returns from investments [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref051\" class=\"ref-tip\">51</a>]. It’s better to combine investment spending with cash flow from ongoing operations than to measure and report both discretely [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref052\" class=\"ref-tip\">52</a>]. Three factors directly affect the company’s access to cash: (i) the company’s inability to obtain cash receivables while waiting for the customer to pay for the delivered goods; (ii) the company is unable to obtain cash receivables; (iii) the company is unable to obtain cash receivables. (ii) Cash invested in goods is tied up and unavailable and the goods are inventoried; and (iii) cash may be made to the company if it chooses to delay payment to suppliers for goods or services provided [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. While a company’s cash payments and collections are typically managed by the company’s finance department, the three factors that affect cash flow are primarily manipulated by operational decisions [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref053\" class=\"ref-tip\">53</a>].</p><p>In the literature, the prevailing view is that the presence of liquidity is not always good for the company and its performance, because sometimes liquidity can be overinvested. Since emerging markets are characterized by imperfect markets, companies maintain internal resources in the form of liquidity to meet their obligations. As in emerging markets, financial markets are inefficient in allocating resources and releasing financial constraints, resulting in underinvestment by financially constrained companies [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref054\" class=\"ref-tip\">54</a>]. In addition, access to capital markets, external financing costs, and availability of internal financing are financial factors on which a company’s investments rely [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref055\" class=\"ref-tip\">55</a>]. Alternatively, the pecking order theory [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref056\" class=\"ref-tip\">56</a>] argues that due to information asymmetry, companies adopt a hierarchical order of financing preferences, so internal financing takes precedence over external financing. A study by Zimon and Tarighi [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>] argue that businesses must use the right working capital strategy to achieve sustainable growth as it optimizes operating costs and maintains financial liquidity. Moreover, asset acquirements affect a company’s output and performance [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref057\" class=\"ref-tip\">57</a>].</p><p>The existing literature provides different evidence of the impact of working capital management on firm performance. A study by Sharma and Kumar [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref058\" class=\"ref-tip\">58</a>] examine the relationship between working capital management and corporate performance in Indian firms. Considering a sample of 263 listed companies during the period 2000–2008, they found that CCC had a positive impact on ROA. Similarly, of the 52 Jordanian listed companies in the period 2000–2008, Abuzayed [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>] found a positive impact of CCC on total operating profit and Tobin’s-Q. Similar findings have been reported by companies in China [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref059\" class=\"ref-tip\">59</a>], the Czech Republic [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref060\" class=\"ref-tip\">60</a>], Ghana [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>], Indonesia [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>], Spain [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref061\" class=\"ref-tip\">61</a>], and Visegrad Group countries [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref062\" class=\"ref-tip\">62</a>]. In contrast, few studies reported an inverse correlation between CCC and firm performance in India [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref063\" class=\"ref-tip\">63</a>], Malaysia [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>], and Vietnam [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref064\" class=\"ref-tip\">64</a>]. A negative correlation indicates that a higher CCC leads to lower company performance. A study by Afrifa et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref065\" class=\"ref-tip\">65</a>] did not find any significant relationship between CCC and firm performance. The findings of the relationship between NWC and company performance are not much different from CCC. Companies in European countries [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref066\" class=\"ref-tip\">66</a>], and the United Kingdom [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref067\" class=\"ref-tip\">67</a>] reported positive correlations, and those in Poland reported negative correlations [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref068\" class=\"ref-tip\">68</a>]. Although previous operations management studies have explored the relationship between working capital and firm performance, the results of these studies remain inconclusive, and the study has found positive, curved, and even insignificant relationships. This is mainly since accidental factors make this relationship both complex and special. Therefore, to enhance the beneficial impact of working capital and cash flow on corporate performance, companies must make appropriate investments to promote more objective, informed, and business-specific working capital and cash flow management choices [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref069\" class=\"ref-tip\">69</a>]. Collectively, these mixed pieces of evidence provide sufficient motivation for this study to develop hypotheses based on positive and negative relationships.</p><h3>The cash flow measures and firm financial performance</h3><p>The firms’ trade where merchandise sold on credit instead of calling for instantaneous cash imbursement, such transaction generate accounts receivables [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref070\" class=\"ref-tip\">70</a>]. Accounts receivable directly affect the liquidity of the enterprise, and thus the efficiency of the enterprise [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref071\" class=\"ref-tip\">71</a>]. From the stands of a seller, the investment in accounts receivables is a substantial component in the firm’s balance sheet. Firms’ progressive approach towards significant investment in accounts receivables with respect to choice of policies for credit management contributes significantly to enhance firm value [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref072\" class=\"ref-tip\">72</a>]. Firms can utilize cash received from customers by investing in activities which contribute to enhance sales [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>]. Firms can improve liquidity position with capability to collect overheads from customers for supplied goods and services rendered in a timely manner [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. However, credit sales is instrumental to increase sales opportunities for firms but may also increase collection risk which can lead to cash flow stresses even to healthy sales growth companies [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref073\" class=\"ref-tip\">73</a>]. Firms offer sales discounts which may not increase sales but may increase payments by customers and improve firms’ cash flow, reduce uncertainty of future cash flows, reduce risk and required rate of return [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref074\" class=\"ref-tip\">74</a>].</p><p>Literature suggests that firm performance increases with shorter period of day’s sales outstanding [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>]. Accordingly, Deloof [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref075\" class=\"ref-tip\">75</a>] by working on Belgians firms find negative relationship between number of days accounts receivables and gross operating income. However, models of trade credit (such as; Emery, [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]) endorse that higher profits also lead to more accounts receivables as firms with higher profits are rich in cash to lend to customers. In a study by García-Teruel and Martinez- Solano [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref076\" class=\"ref-tip\">76</a>] suggest that managers of firms with fewer external financial resources available generally dependent on short term finance and particularly on trade credit that can create value by shortening the days sales outstanding. Furthermore, Gill <em>et al</em>. [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>] declare that firm can create value and increase profitability by reducing the credit period given to customers. Kroes and Manikas [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>] analyzed manufacturing firms and suggested that decline in days of sales outstanding relates to improvements in firm financial performance and persists to several quarters. According to Moran [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref077\" class=\"ref-tip\">77</a>] suppliers happily offer reasonable sales discounts for early payments which improve their cash flow position, locks the receivables, remove the bad debt risk at early stage, and reduce their day’s sales outstanding significantly which ultimately improve their working capital position. <a href=\"#pone-0287135-g001\">Fig 1</a> depicts this relationship. In consistent with discussion the following hypothesis is proposed:</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287135.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287135.g001</a></p><p>The research has mixed views whether reduction in inventory is beneficial to firm performance or increase in inventory leads to increased performance. Despite high cash flow, inventory level management has been neglected [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref078\" class=\"ref-tip\">78</a>]. In this regard literature has evidenced three themes of relationships: positive relationship, negative relationship or no relationship, and inclusion of moderators and mediators to the relationship of number of day’s inventory and firm performance [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref079\" class=\"ref-tip\">79</a>]. However, the inventory management revolutionized after the launch of lean system with familiarizing just-in-time inventory philosophy by Japanese companies [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref080\" class=\"ref-tip\">80</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref081\" class=\"ref-tip\">81</a>]. Afterwards, research related to inventory management evidenced that firms which adopted lean system not only improved customer satisfaction but also attained greater level of asset employment that ultimately leads to higher organizational growth, profitability, and market share [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref082\" class=\"ref-tip\">82</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref083\" class=\"ref-tip\">83</a>]. Moreover, in a JIT context firms experience positive effects on organizational performance due to reduced inventory, and reduction in inventory significantly improves three performance measures such as: profits, firms return on sales, and return on investments [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref084\" class=\"ref-tip\">84</a>]. Additionally, Fullerton and McWatters [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref085\" class=\"ref-tip\">85</a>] found positive influence of reduced inventory on organizational performance which corresponds to JIT context.</p><p>However, generally literature considers that better inventory performance such as: higher inventory turns or decreased level of inventory is normally attributed to better firm financial performance [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref086\" class=\"ref-tip\">86</a>]. Moreover, it is a mutual consent by researchers that high level of inventory also signifies demand and supply misalliance and often related to poor operational performance [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref087\" class=\"ref-tip\">87</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref088\" class=\"ref-tip\">88</a>]. In a study by Elsayed and Wahba [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref079\" class=\"ref-tip\">79</a>] indicated that there is influence of organizational life cycle on the relationship of inventory and organizational performance. Their results indicated that at initial stage though ratio of inventory to sales negatively affects organizational performance, but it put forth significant and positive coefficient on organizational performance at the revival phase or rapid growth phase. Additionally, literature has documented negative influence of reduced inventory on performance. In a study by Obermaier and Donhauser [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref089\" class=\"ref-tip\">89</a>] evidenced that lowest level of inventory leads to poor organizational performance and suggest that moving towards zero inventory case is not always favorable. <a href=\"#pone-0287135-g001\">Fig 1</a> depicts this relationship. Accordingly the hypothesis is proposed as follows:</p><p>According to Deloof [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref075\" class=\"ref-tip\">75</a>] payment delays to suppliers are beneficial to assess the quality of product bought, and can serve as a low-cost and flexible basis of financing for the firm. On the contrary, delaying payments to suppliers may also prove to be costly affair if firm misses the discount for early payments offered [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref090\" class=\"ref-tip\">90</a>], hence firms by reducing days payable outstanding (DPO) likely to enhance firm financial performance [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref076\" class=\"ref-tip\">76</a>]. In line with this, Soenen [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>] states that firms try to collect cash inflows as quickly as possible and delay outflows to possible length. Payment delays enable firms to hold cash for longer duration which ultimately increases firms’ liquidity [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref050\" class=\"ref-tip\">50</a>]. As discussed by Farris and Hutchsion [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>] that firms can improve cash to cash cycle by extending the average accounts payable along with inventory and get interest free financing. A study by Sandoval <em>et al</em>. [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref091\" class=\"ref-tip\">91</a>] speculate that investors are more sensitive to accruals of long-term operating assets than to accruals of long-term operating liabilities because the former is more associated with recurring profits than the latter. Moreover, Fawcett <em>et al</em>. [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref092\" class=\"ref-tip\">92</a>] indorsed that by extending the duration of accounts payable cycle companies can improve their cash to cash cycle. However, longer payment cycles not only harm relationship with suppliers, but may also lead to lower level of services from suppliers [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref093\" class=\"ref-tip\">93</a>].</p><p>As discussed by Raghavan and Mishra [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref094\" class=\"ref-tip\">94</a>] firms may be reluctant to produce or order at optimal point followed by cash restraints for fast growing firms where money plays the role of catalyst when demand is significantly high but firms are financially restricted to order less and this situation may mark the harmful effects over the performance of whole supply chain at least on temporary basis until restored. Hence, this situation is favoring that firms encourage and motivate their customers for quicker payments in order to increase cash to cash cycles [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref092\" class=\"ref-tip\">92</a>]. <a href=\"#pone-0287135-g001\">Fig 1</a> depicts this relationship. Accordingly based on discussion hypothesis is proposed as follows:</p><h3>The cash flow metrics and firm financial performance</h3><p>As shown by Richards and Laughlin [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>] that firms should collect inflows as quickly as possible and postpone cash outflows as long as possible which is a general view based on the concepts of operating cash cycle (OCC) and cash conversion cycle (CCC). This shows that firms by reducing CCC cycle can make internal operation more efficient that ensures the availability of net cash flows, which in turn depicts a more liquid situation of the firm, or vice versa [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>]. They further said that cash conversion cycle (CCC) is based on accrual accounting and linked to firm valuation. Baños-Caballero <em>et al</em>. [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref095\" class=\"ref-tip\">95</a>] suggested that however, higher level of CCC increases firm sales and ultimately profitability, but may have opportunity cost because firms must forgo other potential investments in order to maintain that level. On the contrary, longer duration of CCC may hinder firms to be profitable because this is how firms’ duration of average accounts receivables and inventory turnover increase which may lead firms towards decline in profitability [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref096\" class=\"ref-tip\">96</a>]. Therefore, cash conversion cycle (CCC) can be reduced by shortening accounts receivables period and inventory turnover with prolonged supplier credit terms which ultimately enable firms to experience higher profitability [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref097\" class=\"ref-tip\">97</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref098\" class=\"ref-tip\">98</a>]. A shorter duration of CCC helps managers to reduce some unproductive assets’ holdings such as; marketable securities and cash [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>]. Because with low level of CCC firms can conserve the debt capacity of firm which enable to borrow less short term assets in order to fulfill liquidity. Therefore, shorter CCC is beneficial for firms that not only corresponds to higher present value of net cash flows from firm assets but also corresponds to better firm performance [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref060\" class=\"ref-tip\">60</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref062\" class=\"ref-tip\">62</a>].</p><p>Operating cash cycle is a time duration where firm’s cash is engaged in working capital prior cash recovery when customers make payments for sold goods and services rendered [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>]. Literature endorses that shorter the operating cash cycle better the firm liquidity and financial performance because companies can quickly reassign cash and cultivate from internal sources [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. In a study by Kroes and Manikas [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>] find that there is significant negative relationship between changes in OCC with changes in firm financial performance. They further suggested that OCC can be taken by managers as a metric to monitor firm performance and can be used as lever to manipulate in order to improve firm performance. A study by Farshadfar and Monem [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref099\" class=\"ref-tip\">99</a>] also found that when the company’s operating cash cycle is shorter and the company is small, the cash flow component improves earnings forecasting power better than the accrual component. Moreover, Nobanee and Al Hajjar [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref100\" class=\"ref-tip\">100</a>] recommend the optimum operating cycle as a more accurate and complete working capital management measure to maximize the company’s sales, profitability, and market value. <a href=\"#pone-0287135-g001\">Fig 1</a> depicts this relationship. Hence, based on above discussion the proposed hypotheses are:</p><h2>Data and variables</h2><h3>Samples selection</h3><p>The data used in this study is taken from China Stock Market and Accounting Research (CSMAR) database. The study includes quarterly panel data of non-financial firms with A-shares listed on Shanghai Stock Exchange (SHSE) and Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE). The data comprises on eight quarters ranging from 2018:q2-2020:q1, and four lag effects are included that make data up to twelve quarters. The use of quarterly data ensures greater granularity in the findings of the study as prior studies have mainly used annual data, therefore, this study uses two years plus one year of lagged data which offers exclusively a robust sample period that is instrumental to effective inference [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>]. The main benefit of this method of examining quarterly changes within a company is that the company cannot have any missing data items throughout the sample period. Because any missing data will lead to design errors and imbalance panel data. Therefore, this problem led to now selection of a 12-quarter observation frame (two years plus one year of lagging data) because it delivers a reliable sample period from which effective conclusions can be prepared. Moreover, the data is further refined and maintained from unobserved factors, unbalanced panels, and calculation biases. Moreover, deleted firm-year observation with missing values; excluded all financial firms; as their operating, investing, and financing activities are different from non-final firms [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref075\" class=\"ref-tip\">75</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref101\" class=\"ref-tip\">101</a>], eliminated firms with traded period less than one year, and excluded all firms with less than zero equity. The data is further winsorized up to one percent tail in order to mitigate potential influence of outliers [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref076\" class=\"ref-tip\">76</a>]. Additionally, the firms’ data with negative values for instance; sales and fixed assets is also removed [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref067\" class=\"ref-tip\">67</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref101\" class=\"ref-tip\">101</a>]. The final sample left with balanced panel of 20288 firm year observations consists of 2536 groups. The change (Δ) in all dependent and independent variables of the study sample represents variable period t measured as difference between value at the end of current quarter and value of the variable at the end of prior quarter divided by value of the variable at the end of prior quarter.</p><h3>Dependent variable</h3><p>The firm’s financial performance is dependent variable in the study and is measured through Tobin’s-q. Tobin’s-q is the ratio of firm’s market value to its assets replacement value and it is widely used indictor for firm performance [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref102\" class=\"ref-tip\">102</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref105\" class=\"ref-tip\">105</a>]. Tobin’s-q diminishes most of the shortcomings inherent in accounting profitability ratios as accounting practices influence accounting profit ratios and valuation of capital market applicably integrates firm risk and diminishes any distortion presented by tax laws and accounting settlements [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref106\" class=\"ref-tip\">106</a>]. Moreover, this variable has preference over other accounting measures (such as; ROA) as an indicator of relative firm performance [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref107\" class=\"ref-tip\">107</a>].</p><h3>Independent variables</h3><p>Based on established literature [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref075\" class=\"ref-tip\">75</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref076\" class=\"ref-tip\">76</a>] this study has used three cash flow measures and two composite metrics as independent variables. Each one of them is discussed below.</p><h4>Accounts receivables turning days (ARTD).</h4><p>Accounts receivables turning days (ARTD) are the average number of days required by firms for collecting the payments from customers after the sales is done [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref076\" class=\"ref-tip\">76</a>]. Following Ding <em>et al</em>.

The CCC is a measure of cash outlays for resources and receipt of cash from the sales of a product.

Following Deloof [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref075\" class=\"ref-tip\">75</a>] the study uses firm size by taking natural logarithm of quarterly sales. The firm size has significant impact on market value of firms [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref103\" class=\"ref-tip\">103</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref108\" class=\"ref-tip\">108</a>]. Study uses quarterly sales instead of total assets as measure for firm size to avoid the potential multicollinearity problem because total asset is denominator for the dependent variable [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>]. Following Baños-Caballero <em>et al</em>. [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref095\" class=\"ref-tip\">95</a>] study controls for return on asset (ROA) which is accounting measure of firms. Return on assets (ROA) is a ratio of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) divided by total assets [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref109\" class=\"ref-tip\">109</a>].</p><h3>Descriptive statistics</h3><p><a href=\"#pone-0287135-t001\">Table 1</a> shows the descriptive statistics of variables of the study. The mean and median value of ARTD is 92.89 and 73.14, respectively. On average, the firms in our sample have relatively higher median value of days of sales outstanding than evidence of Ding <em>et al</em>. [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>], which shows that Chinese firms take longer to collect their payments from customers. The mean and median value of APTD is 105 and 82.25, respectively. The mean and median value of ITD is 166.18 and 107.13, respectively. On average it shows relatively high inventory turnover in our sample firms which signifies that Chinese firms are quite efficient in inventory management and products are not sitting idle in shelves. The mean and median value of CCC is 150.62 and 115.30, respectively. On average the CCC of Chinese firms is relatively high. However, in a study by Hill <em>et al</em>. [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref101\" class=\"ref-tip\">101</a>] indicated that higher CCC also signifies higher firm profitability. The mean and median value of OCC is 250.71 and 206.44, respectively. The firm performance (Tobins-q) has a mean and median value of 2.86 and 2.27. The ROA shows mean and median value of 2.46 and 1.67, respectively. On average the size of Chinese firms is 20.79 with median value of 20.71.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287135.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287135.t001</a></p><p>The <a href=\"#pone-0287135-t002\">Table 2</a> reports results for correlation matrix. The correlation coefficient between Tobin’s-Q and CCC is significant and negative at 1 percent level which is consistent to the findings of Afrifa [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref067\" class=\"ref-tip\">67</a>]. The correlation between all the measures of cash flows and ROA is significant and negative at 1 percent, consistent with the results of Deloof [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref075\" class=\"ref-tip\">75</a>]. Moreover the correlation between ROA and CCC is also significant and negative at 1 percent, similar evidences find by García-Teruel and Martinez-Solano [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref076\" class=\"ref-tip\">76</a>] for the sample of Spanish firms. Furthermore, the correlation coefficients among all the variables are significantly lower than 0.80 indicating no sign of multicollinearity [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref110\" class=\"ref-tip\">110</a>]. The formal test of variance inflation factor (VIF) for all the independent variables of study were examined to check if there is presence of multicollinearity. The variance inflation factor (VIF) also indicated no multicollinearity among analysis variables with all values below the threshold level of 10 proposed by Field [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref110\" class=\"ref-tip\">110</a>], which shows that multicollinearity may not be the case and data is suitable for further analysis.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287135.t002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287135.t002</a></p><h2>Methodology, empirical analysis and discussion</h2><h3>Effect of cash flow measures on firm financial performance</h3><p>To investigate the relationship between cash flow measures and firm financial performance, study regresses firm financial performance on cash flow measures and specific control variables. The study followed generalized estimating equations (GEEs) of Zeger and Liang [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>] population averaged technique for the analysis. One of the specific advantage of GEEs over other techniques is, its ability to robustly estimate the variances of regression coefficients for data samples that display high correlation between repeated measurements [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref111\" class=\"ref-tip\">111</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref112\" class=\"ref-tip\">112</a>]. To model and check the relationship of importance amid the dependent variable and explanatory variables, GEEs practice a function named as link function. Conditional on the dissemination of the dependent variable, many link functions could be stated to line the association amid the forecasted variables and the dependent variable. In the data, the explanatory and explained variables are distributed normally; so, the examines employs the non-transforming function of identity link function Δ(ᴜ<sub>i</sub>)¼ Y<sub>i</sub>Ɓ, where ᴜ<sub>i</sub>¼ È(ýi|Y<sub>i</sub>), and ᵬ signifies the trajectory of coefficients of regression (ᵬ1,…, ᵬn) projected via the GEEs method. The GEEs method evaluates the parameters of model (ᵬ’s) over the iterative process which augments data fit to the research model. Repetitive time-series monetary quantities, for instance; the cash flow mechanisms, display a first order autoregressive link amid time phases [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref113\" class=\"ref-tip\">113</a>]. So, the employed association matrix Ř(ẩ) is outlined with the auto-regressive first-order AR(1) condition [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>]. The following estimation equations of (GEEs) demonstrates the model of regression for cash flow measures:\\n<a name=\"pone.0287135.e006\" id=\"pone.0287135.e006\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287135.e006\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(6)</span></span></p><p>Where ΔY<sub>it</sub> represents Tobin’s-q for industry i and time t.

The dependent variable is firm performance (Tobin’s-q) in all the models columns 2 through 4. <em>H1a</em>, <em>H1b</em>, and <em>H1c</em> posits that changes in measures of cash flow (ΔARTD, ΔITD, and ΔAPTD) changes firm financial performance. The coefficient of accounts receivable turning days (ΔARTD) in model 1 is -0.0068297, which is statistically significant at 0.1% confidence level in the current quarter. It is consistent with the study’s argument that decline in firms’ days of accounts receivables increases firm financial performance. Similar evidences were found by Shin and Soenen [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>], Wilner [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref114\" class=\"ref-tip\">114</a>], Deloof [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref075\" class=\"ref-tip\">75</a>], and Kroes and Manikas [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>]. According to Deloof [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref075\" class=\"ref-tip\">75</a>] the negative relationship between days sales outstanding and firm performance suggests that managers can create value for their shareholders by reducing number of day’s accounts receivables to a reasonable minimum.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287135.t003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287135.t003</a></p><p>The coefficient of inventory turning days (ΔITD) in model 1 is -0.0003014, which is statistically significant at 0.1% confidence level in the current quarter. These results are consistent with the argument given in hypothesis <em>H1b</em>. Significant number of studies conclude that low inventory period increases liquidity and firm performance [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref075\" class=\"ref-tip\">75</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref086\" class=\"ref-tip\">86</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref115\" class=\"ref-tip\">115</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref116\" class=\"ref-tip\">116</a>]. Moreover, this finding is consistent with literature as firms sound inventory position exhibits better operational and financial performance [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref117\" class=\"ref-tip\">117</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref118\" class=\"ref-tip\">118</a>].</p><p>The coefficient of accounts payable turning days (ΔAPTD) in model 1 is -0.0717425, which is statistically significant at 0.1% confidence level in the current quarter. These results are consistent with present study’s argument that decline in accounts payable turning days brings positive improvements in firm performance. The findings of results for APTD present strong evidence that when companies reduce their APTD by taking advantage of early discounts payment from suppliers, firms may have a persistent duration of perpetual firm financial performance improvement. As suggested by Moran [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref077\" class=\"ref-tip\">77</a>] that firms may be more beneficial by taking advantage of early payment discounts than prolonging the cycle because of reduction in purchase price of components and materials by them.</p><p>Next, study estimated <a href=\"#pone.0287135.e006\">Eq 6</a> by dividing the sample into two subsamples based on firm leverage level, which is measured by firms’ debt to assets ratio. The high leverage (low leverage) contains firms in industries where their debt to assets ratio is greater (smaller) than the median value. Model 2 and 3 obtain similar patterns when applied on <a href=\"#pone.0287135.e006\">Eq (6)</a> for high and low leveraged firms. The findings of results for high leverage and low leverage firms still hold as of full sample firms and strongly support hypotheses <em>H1a</em>, <em>H1b</em>, <em>and H1c</em>. Conclusively, the findings of results imply that reduction in three cash flow measures (ARTD, ITD, and APTD) relate to significant positive improvements in financial performance of firms at current quarter.</p><h3>Effect of cash flow metrics on firm financial performance</h3><p>In this section, the study investigates how changes in cash flow metrics (CCC and OCC) change firm financial performance. Previous literature suggests that lower the level of CCC and OCC better the firm financial performance. Since with longer duration of cash conversion cycle firms may encounter with shortage of liquidity and firm operation may be affected. Hence, the study assumes that changes in CCC and OCC bring positive improvements in firm financial performance. Present study applied following estimation equations of (GEEs) model for cash flow metrics. The model is stated as:\\n<a name=\"pone.0287135.e007\" id=\"pone.0287135.e007\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287135.e007\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(7)</span></span></p><p>Where ΔY<sub>it</sub> represents Tobin’s-q for industry i and time t.

These evidences of results are consistent with existing literature and show that decline in cash conversion cycle brings positive improvements in firm financial performance [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref075\" class=\"ref-tip\">75</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref076\" class=\"ref-tip\">76</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref096\" class=\"ref-tip\">96</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref097\" class=\"ref-tip\">97</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref119\" class=\"ref-tip\">119</a>]. A study by Zeidan and Shapir [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>] finds that reducing the CCC by not affecting the sales and operating margin increases the prices of shares, profits, and free cash flow to equity. Moreover, Prior research view that careful handling of the cash conversion cycle leads firms to significantly higher returns [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref075\" class=\"ref-tip\">75</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref076\" class=\"ref-tip\">76</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref097\" class=\"ref-tip\">97</a>]. This outcome is consistent with the research by Simon et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref120\" class=\"ref-tip\">120</a>], Soukhakian and Khodakarami [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref121\" class=\"ref-tip\">121</a>], Basyith et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>], Yousaf et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref060\" class=\"ref-tip\">60</a>], and Bashir and Regupathi [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. The findings of the results show a significant negative association of OCC with firm financial performance in the current quarter for highly leveraged firms. The findings suggest that change in OCC led to changes in corporate performance provides significant support to the use of OCC as an indicator for managers to monitor performance and as a lever to manipulate to improve the corporate financial performance. The findings show that OCC in the current quarter posits a significant negative relationship with firm financial performance for highly leveraged firms. This evidence is consistent with the empirical findings of Churchill and Mullins [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>].</p><h3>Difference of coefficients across high leverage and low leverage firms</h3><p>In addition, in the next section the present study analyzed the difference of coefficients across two groups by dividing sample into two subsamples, high leveraged and low leveraged firms based on their total debt to total assets ratios. In order to check the difference of coefficients across two groups study applied seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) system on Eqs (<a href=\"#pone.0287135.e006\">6</a>) and (<a href=\"#pone.0287135.e007\">7</a>) to better isolate the effect of cash flow measures and metrics on firm financial performance. The study computed standard errors for differenced coefficients via the seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) system that combines two groups.</p><p>The <a href=\"#pone-0287135-t005\">Table 5</a> reports results for differential impact of cash flow measures and metrics on firm performance across high leverage and low leverage industries. The study finds that the estimated coefficients for differences are positive and statistically significant. These findings of results imply that low leveraged industries are better off in terms of changes in cash flow measures and metrics that bring more positive changes in low debt industries financial performance. Since, low cash conversion cycle (CCC) conserves the debt capacity of the firm as in this situation firms need less short term borrowing to provide liquidity [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref097\" class=\"ref-tip\">97</a>]. Therefore, lower cash conversion cycle (CCC) lessens the requirement for lines of credit and contributes to the firms’ debt capacity [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>]. Due to high financial distress and higher likelihood of bankruptcy high leverage firms are more bounded by financial constraints which may hinder them to take valuable investments and, thus, harm their profitability [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref122\" class=\"ref-tip\">122</a>]. This also suggests that firms with low leverage are high value firms and maintain lower duration of cash conversion cycle (CCC) at low levels that counts to higher profitability which ultimately leads to higher retained earnings and reduce the need for debt.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287135.t005\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287135.t005</a></p><h3>Test of endogeneity effect and sensitivity analysis</h3><p>To further identify an endogeneity concern in estimated results following Arellano and Bover [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>] and Blundell and Bond [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>] study uses system GMM estimator to alleviate the endogeneity to further investigate the effect of changes in cash flow measures and metrics on firm financial performance. The system GMM method of estimation provides consistent parameter estimates by utilizing instruments that can be obtained from the orthogonality conditions that exist between the lagged values of the variables and disturbances [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref123\" class=\"ref-tip\">123</a>]. The system GMM model controls unobserved heterogeneity and potential problems of endogeneity which cash literature has often highlighted [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref124\" class=\"ref-tip\">124</a>]. The significant benefit of using GMM estimator is that GMM estimator is robust to capture endogeneity issues and also controls serial correlation problem. Precisely, the present study following Blundell and Bond [<a href=\"#pone.0287135.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>] measured two estimators that can expand the accuracy of the standard first-differenced GMM estimator for the GMM models of this paper. One method enforces an added constraint on the primary settings process, under which all the moment conditions accessible can be exploited by a linear GMM estimator in a system of first-differenced and levels equations. The second method situations, on the pragmatic early standards, to gain a system that under certain conditions can be projected constantly by error components, known as generalized least square (GLS). The finite sample properties of these estimators were studied using Monte Carlo simulations. Both can increase vibrantly on the performance of the usual first-differenced GMM estimator when the autoregressive parameter is moderately high and the number of time-series observations are moderately small. Besides, asymptotic variance comparisons recommend that the system GMM estimator can be significantly more effectual than non-linear GMM in this case. Our results extend certainly towards dynamic models with regressors. The AR (2) test represents the test for residual’s second-order serial correlation in the differenced equation, asymptotically distributed as (0, N) under the hypothesis of no serial correlation. The study follows Monte Carlo simulation where in <a href=\"#pone.0287135.e008\">Eq (8)</a>, <em>i</em> = 1, 2, …,N and <em>t</em> = 2, 3, …, <em>T</em>, wherein each case the <em>Ƞi</em> and <em>ɛ</em><sub><em>i</em>,<em>t</em></sub> are drawn as mutually independent i.i.d.

Most studies on cash flow management have focused on its relationship to profitability from the perspective of manufacturing companies. This research focuses on cash flow management by linking the leverage of non-financial firms in the Chinese context, a fundamental issue of corporate cash flow management and working capital investment that has not been studied much in the emerging markets scenario. Practically study suggests that a decline in cash flow measures and metrics positively enhances a company’s financial performance. Moreover, the paper determines that low-leverage industries perform healthier to cash flow measures and metrics changes. The study also reveals that companies in low-debt industries experience more positive improvements in their financial performance relative to high-debt industry companies. Therefore, the findings of this paper suggest that highly leveraged companies may be less conducive to improving corporate performance in industries where competitors’ leverage is relatively low.</p><p>Thus, from managers’ and policymakers’ points of view, the analysis found that changes in cash flow measures (ARTD, ITD, and APTD) and metrics (CCC and OCC) have led to significant positive improvements in the company’s financial performance. These positive changes in the CCC mean that changes in the accounts payable cycle appear to mitigate the combined impact of changes in the accounts receivable and inventory cycles. For managers, this finding suggests that reducing CCC simply by lowering APTD can translate into improvements in company performance. These findings provide rich insights and practical implications for managers and policymakers to use CCC as an operational tool to improve company performance. Therefore, managers and policymakers must actively evaluate the company’s policies regarding cash flow management, working capital management, corporate leverage, and capital budgeting policy before capitalizing on these companies.</p><h2>Conclusion, limitations, and future implications</h2><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Cash flow management is the central issue of company operational strategies that affect a firm’s operational decisions and financial position. Firms’ effective policy of cash flow management is achievable through efficient management of working capital, which is possible through shorter days of accounts receivables, giving discounts on prompt payments, offering cash incentives, reducing inventory turning days through sound inventory management policies, shortening days of accounts payable by achieving rebate on early outlays. Likewise, inventory turnover may lead to a significant positive relationship with organizational performance symbolized by return on assets, cash flow margins, and return on sales in the JIT context. Moreover, high-performance firms may have a lengthier duration of days of accounts payables, which ensures the presence of liquidity. Many firms invest a large portion of their cash in working capital, which suggests that efficient working capital management significantly impacts corporate profitability.</p><p>This paper offers a strong insight and findings on cash flow management and firm financial performance by examining the Chinese full sample firms, high debt, and low debt firms to investigate the impact of changes in cash flow measures and metrics on firm performance. Using the exclusive cash flow measures and metrics data, study finds that decline in cash flow measures and metrics bring significant positive changes in firm financial performance. Moreover, study finds that low leveraged industries are better off in terms of changes in cash flow measures and metrics that bring more positive improvements in low debt industries firms’ financial performance relatively to high debt industries firms. This paper also demonstrates that, following firms’ leverage, high-leveraged firms may be less advantageous to enhance firm performance in industries where rivals are relatively low-leveraged.</p><p>The results of the study are consistent with the argument that changes in cash flow measure (ARTD, ITD and APTD) and metrics (CCC and OCC) bring significant positive improvements in firm financial performance. These findings furnish a great amount of insight and practical implication for manager to utilize CCC as operating tool in order to enhance firm performance. Firms by actively monitoring and controlling levers such as; ARTD, ITD, APTD, CCC, OCC can enhance financial performance. The findings of results are robust to different measures and metrics of cash flow and firm financial performance, following sensitivity analysis and endogeneity test still main results hold and ensures the robustness of primary analysis.</p><h3>Study limitations and directions for future research</h3><p>This research is of great significance to the studies on the relationship between cash flow management and enterprise performance in the Chinese market environment. However, the study did not consider some aspects that need consideration in future studies. This study uses Tobin Q to measure a company’s performance. However, it is also possible to include other company performance indicators that are important in the strategic impact of studies and may provide significant insights. The lack of data availability is a major constraint due to companies’ exits and entry into the sample period. This paper uses secondary data; however, studies can also use primary data to understand and gain appropriate knowledge of corporate cash flow management by combining archived and survey data to improve the robustness and significance of research findings in the context of emerging markets. This study focuses on the financial performance of firms. However, future studies can also use non-financial performance as a consequence variable.</p><p>Future extensions of this work may examine whether a company’s cash flow management policies in other areas of the supply chain have a similar relationship to company performance.</p><p>In addition, further inquiries that explore the directional association amid inventory and performance changes may extend the understanding of the cash flow management role in a company’s success. In addition, there is a need to explore more the impact of cash flow and working capital investment on firm performance by taking the market imperfections within the framework of emerging economies. Finally, the evidence of this research from the fastest emergent economy of the world may also use other transition economies to generalize for a widespread population group. Finally, studies in the future can consider linking product market competition with the cash flow measures, metrics, and firm performance relationship.</p><h2>Supporting information</h2><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287135.s001\">S1 Appendix. </a></h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287135.s001\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287135.s001</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(PDF)</p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>The authors wish to thank anonymous referees for all value comments.

The COVID-19 pandemic has only worsened the ongoing affordable housing crisis in the United States while continuing to highlight disparities in health outcomes across populations. We conducted interviewer-administered surveys with refugee and asylum seekers in San Diego County at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic to understand the social effects and drivers of COVID-19 in one of the largest refugee communities in the United States. Staff from a community-based refugee advocacy and research organization administered the surveys from September—November 2020. 544 respondents participated in the survey, which captured the diversity of the San Diego refugee community including East African (38%), Middle Eastern (35%), Afghan (17%), and Southeast Asian (11%) participants. Nearly two-thirds of respondents (65%) reported living in overcrowded conditions (&gt; <span class=\"underline\">1 individual per room)</span> and 30% in severely crowded conditions (<span class=\"underline\">&gt;</span> 1.5 individuals per room). For each additional person per room, self-reported poor emotional health increased. Conversely, family size was associated with a lower likelihood of reporting poor emotional health. Crowded housing was significantly associated with a lower probability of accessing a COVID-19 diagnostic test, with every additional reported person per room there was approximately an 11% increase in the probability of having never accessed a COVID-19 testing. Access to affordable housing had the largest effect size and was associated with fewer people per room. Overcrowding housing is a structural burden that reduces COVID-19 risk mitigation behaviors. Improved access to affordable housing units or receiving vouchers could reduce overcrowded housing in vulnerable refugee communities.</p><p><strong>Citation: </strong>Hassani A, Omaleki V, Erikat J, Frost E, Streuli S, Sahid R, et al.

Globally, in high-income countries, foreign-born residents are at higher risk of COVID-19 transmission, have lower access to testing, and have higher rates of hospitalization and mortality due to COVID-19 compared to native-born residents [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. In San Diego County, one analysis of death certificates found that although foreign-born residents comprise 23% of county residents, they accounted for 40% of all deaths attributed to COVID-19 between March 22, 2020 and March 22, 2021 [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>]. Increased COVID-19 vulnerability in the immigrant and refugee community stems from a number of social and structural factors: Recent immigrants are more likely to work low-wage, frontline jobs, which carry a higher risk of disease acquisition and transmission, and are less likely to provide paid sick leave [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. Concerns about the public charge and a lack of documentation on immigration status may also deter individuals from seeking timely care when an infection is suspected [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>]. As a consequence of working low-wage jobs and racially discriminatory housing practices, immigrants are 4 times more likely to live in crowded housing [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. This can exacerbate secondary attack rates within household units and present challenges for safe isolation [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>].</p><p>Overcrowding in homes—sometimes referred to as ‘hidden homelessness’ has been highlighted by activists and researchers as a major issue in the refugee community in the United States [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. Data from Canada and Europe document the increased risk of infectious disease among refugee communities living in overcrowded housing [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>]. Access to affordable housing (defined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development as ‘housing that costs no more than 30% of your income) is associated with benefits such as improved food security, health care access, reduced stress, housing stability, improved indoor environmental health, and increased mental health [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>]. Despite these benefits, access to affordable housing is severely limited by a backlogged federal Section 8 voucher program for affordable housing and state and local policies that have restricted new constructions of affordable housing and banned public housing [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>].</p><h3>Objectives</h3><p>Immigrant and refugee communities in the United States have been raising the issue of housing as a health and human rights issue for many years [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. As part of their biennial community survey conducted during the first peak of the pandemic on the state of the refugee community in San Diego County, the Partnership for the Advancement of New Americans (PANA) partnered with the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) to better understand the link between housing and COVID-19 vulnerability among refugee communities in Southern California.</p><h2>Methods</h2><h3>Study design and setting</h3><p>The Partnership for the Advancement of New Americans (PANA) is a research, public policy, and community organizing hub that serves refugees and asylum seekers in San Diego County [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. Data for the present cross-sectional study were collected between September 2020 and November 2020 as part of PANA’s biannual community survey. The survey was designed in English and translated into Arabic and Spanish by bilingual study staff. Interviewers were provided with a list of PANA members and the survey was subsequently administered over the phone and in person by trained research assistants in Arabic, Burmese, Dari, English, Karenni, Oromo, Pashto, Somali, Spanish, and Swahili. Up to two household members could be interviewed. However, interviewers tracked whether an individual had completed a survey or not. Data were collected as part of a programmatic report intended to provide a general overview of the community. As such, we did not conduct <em>a priori</em> power calculations focused on one specific outcome.</p><p>Interviewers entered participant answers using Qualtrics software (Qualtrics ver. 2021). The survey contained 83 questions regarding demographics, COVID-19, housing, employment, health, children, belonging, and resilience. The survey took approximately 30 minutes to complete and up to 1 hour if it was being translated. The study team met weekly to discuss any issues with translation and address questions raised by survey administrators. Consistent with our participatory action approach, all data collection and analyses were conducted in conversation with PANA staff and guided by their lived expertise and organizational policy priorities. Variables for the present analyses were chosen in consultation with PANA leadership to address the primary research question: What is the association between housing and COVID-19 vulnerability? Vulnerability was broadly understood as both healthcare access and the broader mental health impact of the epidemic [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>]. The full report with all variables can be found elsewhere [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>].</p><h3>Participants</h3><p>Participants were recruited using a convenience sampling approach. Individuals were eligible to participate in the study if they were over the age of 18, could speak one of the languages included in the study, willing to provide informed consent, and part of the refugee community. “Refugee community member” was construed broadly and included individuals who had arrived as refugees, asylum seekers, or their American-born children. PANA staff contacted all individuals for whom the organization had provided services or with whom they had engaged in community organizing efforts in the previous 5 years. Each staff interviewer was assigned a list of people based on language. Research assistants also recruited participants in person in shopping areas that members of the refugee community typically frequent. Staff interviewed and conducted the survey by phone with each individual from the convenience sample—ensuring no duplication. Interviews were limited to no more than two individuals per household (typically a parent and an adult child). All participants who completed the survey were given a $20 gift card to thank them for their time and expertise.</p><h3>Measures and analyses</h3><p>Within the survey, participants were asked about the total number of individuals living in their homes and the total number of rooms in the home. In accordance with the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), overcrowding was defined as more than one individual per room. Severe overcrowding was defined as 1.5 individuals per room [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. For example, a traditional 2-bedroom apartment would have 4 distinct rooms, including the kitchen and living room, and it would require 6 inhabitants to be classified as “severe overcrowding.” Other explanatory variables included access to affordable housing (Are you in an affordable housing unit, or receiving a section 8 voucher to help with the rent?), access to a diagnostic test for COVID-19 (Have you ever gotten a test for COVID-19?), and self-rated emotional health with 5 potential responses ranging from “never” to “always” (How often have you been bothered by emotional problems such as feeling anxious, depressed or irritable?). In consultation with PANA leadership, the study team decided to dichotomize the emotional health variable for analysis and compare participants who reported ‘never’ experiencing emotional problems vs all others. variables such as income from the previous week (Have you worked for money in the previous week), age, year of arrival to the United States, gender (male or female options only), cohabiting with a partner, number of children (How many children under the age of 18 are you responsible for?), and family size.</p><p>We first examined basic univariate frequencies as a study team to develop a basic understanding of sample demographics and the prevalence of indicators of interest within the sample. We then used chi-square and student’s t-tests to test the hypothesis that our primary predictor and covariates of interest were significantly associated with living in severely overcrowded housing. We built simple logistic regression models to measure the unadjusted odds of association with overcrowded housing. Descriptive and bivariate statistical analyses were conducted using Stata 16 [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>].</p><p>After assessing bivariate associates for both statistical and theoretical significance (the latter based on both the literature and discussions with the PANA leadership team) we constructed a structural equation model based on our hypothesized pathways between crowded housing, access to affordable housing support, reported emotional health, and the likelihood of accessing a COVID-19 test in the summer and fall of 2020. The model was fit to the data with the <em>Mplus</em> software package using a weighted least squares (WSMLV) estimator with probit link function to account for the mixture of binary, ordinal, and continuous variables [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]. Model fit was assessed based on individual covariate statistical significance along with global fit indices as recommended by Kline [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>].</p><h3>Ethical considerations and IRB</h3><p>Informed Consent was verbally obtained from all participants by trained PANA staff before administering the Qualtrics survey. Data gathered from the questionnaires was confidential. This study was reviewed and approved by the University of California, San Diego Institutional Review Board (UCSD IRB) under project #201601SX. In consideration of the vulnerable status of our study population, we adopted a participatory action approach to this community-led project and our team from UCSD only provided technical assistance [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>].</p><h2>Results</h2><p>PANA staff contacted 680 community members and 544 agreed to participate in the survey, for a response rate of 80%. The mean time living within the United States was 12 years, and gender was approximately evenly distributed (<a href=\"#pone-0286993-t001\">Table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286993.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286993.t001</a></p><p>Just over 1 in 4 participants reported that they had engaged in work for money in the previous two weeks. Living in crowded or severely crowded housing conditions was common: participants reported an average of 1.5 individuals per room, with 29.9% (n = 160) living in severely overcrowded conditions. Thirty-two percent (n = 172) lived in affordable housing units or utilized Section 8 vouchers. At the time the study was conducted (September—November 2020), 23% of participants had ever accessed a diagnostic test for COVID-19 (n = 123). Approximately 37% of participants reported that they sometimes, half the time, most of the time, or always experienced emotional problems like anxiety or depression (<a href=\"#pone-0286993-t002\">Table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286993.t002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286993.t002</a></p><p>The full structural model is shown in <a href=\"#pone-0286993-g001\">Fig 1</a>.

Conversely, family size was associated with a lower likelihood of reporting poor emotional health (p &lt; 0.001). Each additional year in the United States was associated with a small, but statistically significant, lower probability of reporting poor emotional health (p = 0.01).</p><p>Crowded housing was significantly associated with a lower probability of accessing a COVID-19 diagnostic test in the summer and fall of 2020.

Of these three, access to affordable housing had the largest effect size and was associated with a 0.37 standard deviation decrease, or 0.34 fewer people per room, with all other factors held constant (p = 0.01).</p><p>Female respondents were 6%, or 0.13 standard deviations, more likely to report having access to affordable housing (p = 0.01), as were individuals who had been in the United States longer, although each additional year was associated with only a small effect size, increasing just 1% per year (p&lt;0.001).</p><h2>Discussion</h2><h3>Key results</h3><p>We found that within the refugee community, living in severely overcrowded housing was significantly associated with a decreased probability of accessing a COVID-19 test and an increased probability of reporting lower emotional health. Individuals who had never accessed a test for COVID-19 were more likely to live in severely crowded housing and significantly more likely to report lower emotional health. Meanwhile, those who reported accessing affordable housing were significantly less likely to report living in severely crowded conditions. Older age and more years lived in the United States were also associated with decreased odds of severely crowded housing conditions.</p><h3>Interpretation</h3><p>The role of housing during the COVID-19 pandemic has focused mainly on how having shelter can mitigate risks of SAR-CoV-2 transmission and the need for moratoriums on evictions [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>]. Overcrowded housing is a known risk factor for contracting and spreading COVID-19 [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>], and the quality of housing and the density of inhabitants per domicile during the pandemic has garnered less attention, especially when regarding public health policy [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]. However, our work identifies a key mechanism through which overcrowded housing may also inhibit risk mitigation behaviors such as accessing COVID-19 diagnostic testing. Overcrowded housing may serve as an inhibition to testing: If an individual does not have the ability to safely isolate themselves from the rest of the household, then COVID-19 tests as tools to trigger isolation or quarantine behaviors become less salient. Given that access to therapeutic treatment for COVID-19 remains low, with lagging uptake in racial and ethnic minorities in particular [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>], these findings suggest that messaging which emphasizes the role of testing as a first step to accessing treatment, rather than a tool to trigger isolation, may be especially important to address ongoing disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.</p><p>We found a significant, meaningful association in the link between lower emotional/mental health and crowded housing in the refugee community. Discussing mental health is highly stigmatized in this community, and the study team agreed that disclosing any concerns related to emotional or mental health in this context was likely indicative of significant levels of emotional distress. There is evidence that overcrowded housing can have a negative impact on an individual’s mental health in the general population [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>]. Our findings add to this literature but our narrowed focus on the refugee community highlights that housing conditions can add an extra emotional and mental burden to a population already at high risk of lower emotional/mental health outcomes [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>]. This combination of the mental strains that refugees in overcrowded housing experience may be alleviated with tailored mental health interventions [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>].</p><p>Affordable housing significantly reduces the odds of living in severely crowded conditions within our study sample. There is an average wait of 8–10 years for applicants to receive a federal section 8 housing voucher to move into an affordable home which is consistent with our data that shows newly arrived refugees are at even higher odds of overcrowding, and that the longer they live in the United States, the more likely they are to live in affordable housing [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>]. Our findings also suggest that refugees living in San Diego are experiencing economic factors that force multiple refugee families to share spaces meant for only one family. This is a form of ’hidden homelessness [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>]. Just over 1 in 4 individuals reported engaging in work for money in the previous 2 weeks. While some of this number may be an artifact of sampling bias (i.e., those who responded were more likely to be free during the day to participate in the survey) and/or represent individuals who are full-time students or homemakers, previous work conducted by our team demonstrated that the refugee community experienced high rates of job loss during the pandemic [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>]. These overcrowded housing arrangements may be necessary for economic survival, but in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, they become hot spots of risk, increasing the likelihood of acquiring, transmitting, and reinfection with the virus [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref038\" class=\"ref-tip\">38</a>].</p><p>Support for affordable housing access as a fundamental human right has grown globally [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>]. The movement to decommodify housing by increasing social housing construction in proportion to privately funded housing has shown promise in tackling the global housing crisis [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>]. Cities like Tokyo or Vienna in particular have successfully handled growing housing demand by creating holistic policies that include social housing construction, limited-profit housing associations, and tenant protections [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>].</p><p>Additionally, housing and location are significant influencers on assimilation and social mobility [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>]. Creating affordable housing that is near physical and social structures has been shown to increase social inclusion and integration [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>]. Therefore, creating affordable housing in the right locations is an essential stepping stone for the resettlement of refugees.</p><h3>Limitations</h3><p>This is a cross-sectional study with a convenience sample. As such we cannot make claims about the directionality of the associations we identified, nor should our data be interpreted as representing a true prevalence. However, a full census of the refugee population in the region—or country—does not exist, making random sampling impractical if not impossible. Additionally, gender was limited to two options (male or female) to preserve statistical significance and we are aware that this may not be a true representation of the diverse population. Survey data was self-reported so it is possible certain topics were biased towards more socially acceptable answers. Furthermore, although the survey was limited to two participants per household, the survey did not record how many participants belonged in the same household. Therefore, we were unable to adjust household size as a fixed effect. However, PANA interviewers reported that in practice it was unusual for two respondents from the same household to participate in the survey.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>Overcrowded housing creates structural burdens that may prevent refugees from taking risk mitigation behaviors like diagnostic testing regarding airborne diseases such as COVID-19. These housing conditions may also be impacting refugee emotional health, signaling the need for mental health resources and further community advocacy in these communities. Promptly increasing access to affordable housing for vulnerable refugee populations may also protect against the increased odds of COVID-19 associated with overcrowding and help mitigate future outbreaks. We recommend that local governments utilize federal resettlement funding in collaboration with community-based organizations to develop and implement affordable housing plans for refugees upon arrival. This will ensure that recently resettled refugees are able to build long-term stability while improving population health in the United States’ most marginalized communities. In addition, we recommend the federal government increase the number of Section 8 vouchers available so that wait times are reduced [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>]. Finally, we recommend that the State of California create legislation and provide funding for permanent social housing based on successful housing policies from other parts of the world, that refugee populations can immediately access [<a href=\"#pone.0286993.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. Future directions in research should look at the impact of master leasing, housing vouchers, and universal basic income on refugee housing security and general health outcomes.</p><h2>References</h2><h3>Subject Areas <div id=\"subjInfo\">?</div>\\n    <div id=\"subjInfoText\">\\n      <p>For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/PLOS/plos-thesaurus/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link opens in new window\">here</a>.</p>\\n      <span class=\"inline-intro\">We want your feedback.</span> Do these Subject Areas make sense for this article?

IRI and RDI occur in the downlink when a relay is transmitting on its access link and interfering with the reception of a backhaul link of another victim relay. While the simultaneous transmission and reception of the FD relay creates the RSI. IRI, RDI, and RSI have detrimental effects on the system performance, leading to lower ergodic capacity and higher outage probability. Some previous contributions only briefly analysed the IRI, RSI, and RDI in a single cell scenario and some assumed that the backhaul and access subframes among the adjacent cells are perfectly aligned for different relays without counting for IRI, RSI and RDI. However, in practise the subframes are not perfectly aligned. In this paper, we eliminate the IRI, RSI, and RDI by using the hybrid zeroforcing and singular value decomposition (ZF-SVD) beamforming technique based on nullspace projection. Furthermore, joint power allocation (joint PA) for the relays and destinations is performed to optimize the capacity. The ergodic capacity and outage probability comparisons of the proposed scheme with comparable baseline schemes corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</p><p><strong>Citation: </strong>Madani Fadoul M, Chow C-O (2023) Half-duplex and full-duplex interference mitigation in relays assisted heterogeneous network.

Introduction</h2><p>5G wireless network runs applications that require high demand for data rates. One of the solutions to solve the data rate requirement is to densify the network by deploying small cells. Such densification can reduce power consumption and offer higher spectral efficiency. Heterogeneous network offers significantly cost-effective means to enhance the capacity of the wireless cellular communication systems by permitting a variety of infrastructure nodes, including HD and FD relays, small cells, etc., to connect to the current multicell networks [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>]. Small cells such as Femto and Pico varying sizes with low transmitted power are the most economic solutions. The main hurdle facing relay assisted heterogeneous network is the interference between nodes such as the relay may cause interference to another relay (IRI) and destination, referred to as relay-to-destination interference (RDI) in addition to relay residual-interference (RSI) [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. These HD and FD relay technology are suitable to be deployed in multicell network to provide coverage and diversity gain. The HD mode is dominating most current communication devices, where the HD relay employs time division or frequency division for backhaul and access link. Allocating different time slots for the transmission and reception, dissipates the worthy channel resources. On the other hand, by utilising FD relay and using the same communication resources, the wireless communication network can double the capacity if compared to the HD relay. Allowing the communicating devices to receive and transmit data simultaneously, using the same time slot through the same channel, brings many advantages. However, the main problem that affects the FD relay communication is the RSI which occurs between the receiving and transmitting antennas of the same node in addition to IRI and RDI.</p><h3>1.1 Related work</h3><p>Heterogeneous network is enabling a variety of infrastructures including a self-configurable relay, base-station etc., to connect to the current small cell networks in an unplanned manner. Increasing the ergodic capacity of wireless communication and efficient utilization of the scarce resources is a crucial claim for the next mobile network generation. Due to enormous growth in next mobile generation users, communication reliability becomes inevitable. The deployment of low-power nodes with irregular infrastructure is more demanding than the traditional cellular infrastructure with high power and regular structure [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. These small cells are suitable for deploying the HD and FD relay technology. Unfortunately, the HD mode is dominating most current communication devices, where the HD employs frequency division duplexing (FDD) or time division duplexing (TDD). Therefore, the worthy resources are dissipated. On the other hand, by utilizing FD and using the same communication resources, the wireless communication network can double the HD ergodic capacity. Allowing the communicating devices to transmit and receive data simultaneously, using the same time slot through the same channel, brings many advantages. FD, however, at the physical layer can double the spectral efficiency, which is measured by the number of bits that reliably communicated per second per Hertz. Further, in a contention network, FD permits implementing collision detection mechanisms while transmitting. However, the main problem that paralyzes the FD relay communication is the RSI which occurs between the transmitting and receiving antennas of the same node in addition to IRI and RDI due to network heterogeneity [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>].</p><p>To get insight into the heterogeneous network interference, interference alignment is a promising technique that has been proposed to achieve high network capacity by increasing the usable channel resource units, i.e. degree-of–freedom (DoF). The main idea of interference alignment is to consolidate the interference into smaller dimensions of signal space at each receiver and use the remaining dimensions to transmit the desired signals [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>]. Reference [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>] modeled the hierarchical Aircomp designs with IRI from other cells. The major problem is that without inter-relay coordination, the characterization of the whole system is considered not for a specific cell. As cellular network splitted in different small cells, network providers may interest in knowing the performance of specific cells only.</p><p>The implementation of the FD relay in the past was infeasible, due to the increasing noise floor at the receiving antennas that may exceed the limited dynamic range of the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>]. The early research papers considered only single antenna nodes to evaluate the performance of a hybrid HD/FD relay network [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]; further, the RSI channel’s gain is assumed to be a constant value, which works only for digital cancellation [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. An infrastructure node network operates with two HD and FD is analyzed in [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. In FD wireless communication, a relay residual-interference cancellation is proposed for two models; where the first model assumed that the RSI is known precisely and the second model assumed that the RSI is unknown [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>]. With no bandwidth constraints and according to channel condition, the FD system can automatically switch its RSI cancellation. This system is restrained by practical limitations such as delay and signal attenuation [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>]. An inband FD radio decreases the RSI level to noise floor is proposed in [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. In an FD two-hop network, the relay acts as a multiple antennas FD node, the effect of resource allocation is studied [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>], in which the impact of the relay distance from the transmitter, the number of antennas, and different RSI modes are investigated. In addition, maximizing the effective signal-to–interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) leads to minimizing the outage probability, and the optimal choice between the HD and FD is calculated [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>]. In a small cell network and under certain power constraints, the spectral efficiency is maximized by a joint beamforming design [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]. The ergodic capacity comparison between the FD and HD relay is evaluated after modeling the FD relay with RSI, it is shown that the FD outperforms the HD relay [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>] at low SNR [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>] via numerical simulation. The capacity trade-off of HD and FD is analyzed for the total system in a two-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) relay. Allowing some SINR degradation with the FD mode is preferable to using two-time slots to eliminate RSI with the HD mode [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]. The FD hybrid BF technique is proposed in [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>], where the sum rate capacity is improved by approximately doubling it due to the successful cancellation of the strong self-interference power.</p><p>On the other hand, an interest in multi-antenna technology has been witnessed in the past few years, which provides higher capacity and improves network coverage. Since the source, relay and destination equipped with multiple antennas, beamforming technique can be performed. The latest research considers the IRI, RSI and RDI to be perfectly mitigated [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>] and others focus on designing beamforming techniques to cancel the interference in MIMO FD relay systems as shown in <a href=\"#pone-0286970-t001\">Table 1</a>. A MIMO beamforming technique such as ZF is applied to suppress the interference or maximize the useful signal [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>]. The performance of cognitive MIMO relay is analyzed by deploying selective zeroforcing beamforming and phase alignment. The ergodic capacity bound of FD relay for two sources has been investigated in [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>], in addition, calculating the channel ergodic capacity, for example, the ergodic capacity of multicast channels is analyzed in [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286970.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286970.t001</a></p><p>In the spatial domain, the self-interference mitigation schemes such as beam selection, antenna selection, minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE), and nullspace projection are proposed, where the relay is equipped with transmit and receive beamforming matrices. However, in the ideal case with perfect channel information, only nullspace projection can eliminate the residual interference [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]. By maximizing the SINR, [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>] suppresses the relay self-interference substantially with less impact on the desired signal. For FD wideband AF MIMO relays, SINR maximization based on RSI mitigation is proposed in [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>]. The DF capacity is maximized via joint optimization for the digital and analog transceiver is considered [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>], to suppress the RSI, an additional adaptive technique was designed based on additional hardware. However, the system did not capture the network heterogeneity.</p><p>The study of [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>] evaluated the SNR of separate cells and concluded that a relay node can further improve the ergodic capacity by relay placement and ignoring the interference from neighboring cells. In a single cell network, [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>] analyzed the effects of different RSI and RDI levels, the system performs worse at high SNR in terms of both outage probability and ergodic capacity. Reference [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>] did not consider any channel model, but only fixed channel gain, in lieu, the SINR value is set to 10 dB for all hops. In this paper, we proposed a simplified and yet effective joint interference mitigation scheme for heterogeneous networks consisting of FD communication system and HD communication system called hybrid method.</p><p>To further improve the system performance, power efficiency is a vital design consideration. Although power allocation algorithms have been widely studied in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>], the existing schemes cannot be directly applied to multicell network because of RSI, IRI and RDI. This is due to the different power requirements from the backhaul and access links. Uniform power allocation at each node has been generally adopted for ease of analysis and computation Meanwhile, in MIMO systems without interference, it has been shown that waterfilling power allocation algorithm is optimal. However, in a MIMO relay network, individual power allocation and aggregate power allocation have been shown to further improve the system power efficiency in a relaying scheme [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>] and can further be extended to multicell network.</p><h3>1.2 Contribution</h3><p>Motivated by the above mentioned limitations in <a href=\"#pone-0286970-t001\">Table 1</a> and owing to the practical HD and FD MIMO relaying network, the interference between nodes such as the relay may cause interference to other relay (IRI) and destination referred as relay-to-destination interference (RDI) in addition to residual self-interference (RSI) due to the use of multiple transmit and receive antennas in a limited space, and also due to network heterogeneity [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>].</p><p>This paper considers a heterogeneous multicell network assisted by FD and HD relaying. Interference-aware transceiver beamforming (BF) matrices based on hybrid zeroforcing and singular value decomposition (ZF-SVD) beamforming technique at the relays and destinations are designed to jointly eliminate the RSI, IRI and RDI. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme has been investigated through Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that the proposed system can achieve better ergodic capacity, sum capacity, and outage probability performance than comparable baseline schemes. Due to the effectiveness of the proposed interference mitigation scheme, the proposed scheme achieves performance close to the ideal scheme without interference consideration. Finally, joint PA is proposed to further improve the system performance of our suboptimal scheme.</p><h3>1.3 Paper outline</h3><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Next, we describe the system model in Section 2. The beamforming design is discussed in Section 3. The capacity of the proposed scheme is derived in Section 4. Comparable baseline schemes derived from the literature are given in Section 5. From Section 6 we further improve the performance of our proposed scheme by joint PA in Section 7.

Maximizing the ergodic capacity of SR-hop and RD-hop is accomplished by formulating an optimization problem under a total network power constrain <em>P</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>.</p><p>Notice that Eqs <a href=\"#pone.0286970.e139\">56</a> and <a href=\"#pone.0286970.e140\">57</a>, have been studied under the condition that <em>P</em><sub><em>SR</em></sub> and <em>P</em><sub><em>RD</em></sub> are fixed, i.e., the source and relay do not work cooperatively. This means that every node should have their own power constraint which does not depend on the power consumption of other nodes. The advantage of this scheme is that the optimization problem can be calculated separately at each node. The disadvantage of separate power constraints at the source and relay is reducing the total capacity. Hence, a joint transmit power optimization of the source and relay would offer a higher capacity. Recall that the total system capacity is limited by the minimum of SR-hop and RD-hop. In such scenario, the transmit power at the weaker hop can be increased while the transmit power at the stronger hop is reduced. This motivates us to consider the joint PA for SR-hop and RD-hop to further improve the spectral efficiency, which simultaneously requires the solution of the following optimization problem\\n<a name=\"pone.0286970.e158\" id=\"pone.0286970.e158\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286970.e158\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(58)</span></span> <a name=\"pone.0286970.e159\" id=\"pone.0286970.e159\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286970.e159\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(59)</span></span></p><p>The total system capacity is limited by the minimum SR-hop and RD-hop.

Equal power allocation (equal PA) assumes that the sources and relays have a unity transmit power and are subjected to an aggregate power constraint, i.e., <em>P</em><sub><em>SR</em></sub> = <em>P</em><sub><em>RD</em></sub> = 1, otherwise waterfilling and joint power allocation (Joint PA) splits the power between the source and relay. Recall that in the proposed scheme, the relay BF matrices are designed to mitigate the RSI, and IRI, while the destination BF matrices are designed to mitigate the RDI. <a href=\"#pone-0286970-g003\">Fig 3</a> shows the ergodic capacity for the proposed scheme with joint power allocation for <em>M</em><sub><em>s</em></sub> = 2, <em>N</em><sub><em>ri</em></sub> = <em>N</em><sub><em>rj</em></sub> = <em>N</em><sub><em>r</em></sub> = 4, <em>M</em><sub><em>ri</em></sub> = <em>M</em><sub><em>rj</em></sub> = <em>M</em><sub><em>r</em></sub> = 6 and <em>N</em><sub><em>d</em></sub> = 4 number of antennas compared to baseline schemes with equal power allocation. With the increase in SNR, the performance of the FD without interference cancellation remains flat because it is limited by the RSI, IRI, and RDI. The proposed scheme has well dealt with IRI, RSI, and RDI and the channel is tending to be well conditioned, due to joint PA [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>]. Moreover, a higher multiplexing gain (evident from the steep slope) is achieved by FD relaying, as compared to HD relaying. This is because the FD relay utilises the channel more efficiently. With proper RSI, IRI and RDI cancellation, the proposed FD relay based on nullspace projection achieves performance close to the ideal FD relay (no interference). The ideal FD relay capacity as shown in Section 5 is almost capacity achieving in scenarios where the <em>C</em><sub><em>SR</em></sub> and <em>C</em><sub><em>RD</em></sub> is sufficiently high because the RSI, IRI, and RDI are not considered. Even-though, the proposed scheme projects the RSI, IRI and RDI to the nullspace of the RSI, IRI and RDI channels respectively, the proposed scheme achieves the same multiplexing gain as the ideal FD relay, evident from the slopes of the ergodic capacity curves.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286970.g003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286970.g003</a></p><p>\\n<a href=\"#pone-0286970-g004\">Fig 4</a> shows the sum ergodic capacity by considering both the FD and HD relays-assisted networks. In general, the higher number of antennas produces higher capacity and multiplexing gain, because of high number of parallel streams that supported by the system. In fact, this is due to the increasing design freedom of the nullspace based relay transmit and receive beamforming design. A higher number of antennas is required at the relay and destination nodes if compared to the source node because the number of antennas must fulfill <em>N</em><sub><em>di</em></sub> ≥ <em>min</em>(<em>M</em><sub><em>rj</em></sub>, <em>N</em><sub><em>dj</em></sub>) + <em>min</em>(<em>M</em><sub><em>ri</em></sub>, <em>N</em><sub><em>di</em></sub>), and <em>N</em><sub><em>dj</em></sub> ≥ <em>min</em>(<em>M</em><sub><em>ri</em></sub>, <em>N</em><sub><em>di</em></sub>) + <em>min</em>(<em>M</em><sub><em>rj</em></sub>, <em>N</em><sub><em>dj</em></sub>) to ensure the interference can be fully removed and provide sufficient degrees of freedom for the intended signal recovery [<a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286970.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>].

The proposed scheme FD after mitigating the interferences achieves close performance to the ideal FD relay. This performance could be seen in supporting high rates with lower outage probability as the ideal FD relay. The ideal FD or HD relay did not consider the interferences.

An interference-aware BF scheme that simultaneously mitigates various combinations of RSI, IRI, and RDI is proposed. The detrimental effect of RSI, IRI, and RDI is removed using nullspace projection techniques at the transceivers. A heterogeneous network deployment becomes possible after canceling the RSI, IRI, and RDI, which offers a significant improvement over the sum capacity and outage probability of FD and HD schemes. This enables the FD to offer close to twice the conventional HD capacity. Further, from the slope of the sum rate, the proposed scheme achieves the same multiplexing gain as the ideal scheme. The results suggest that the ergodic capacity and outage probability can be significantly improved via joint power allocation with hybrid zeroforcing and singular value decomposition (ZF-SVD) beamforming technique.</p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>We would like to thank Assoc.

Gamma-ray spectra can be complex, due to the many possible sources of natural and artificial backgrounds, the large variety of radioactive isotopes and special nuclear material (SNM) that may be relevant to a particular problem, and the possibility of instrumental effects such as calibration drift. To deal with these complexities, machine-learning methods, especially artificial neural networks (ANNs), have been used in gamma-ray spectroscopy for over three decades [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>].</p><p>Recently there has been an increase in the use of machine learning to analyze an entire gamma-ray spectrum, often to determine the presence of certain isotopes and quantify their relative strengths [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>]. As more complex approaches are used for the detection and quantification of isotopes using gamma-ray spectroscopy, and especially as those approaches are potentially encountered in high-stakes security applications, it will become increasingly necessary for researchers and end-users to understand how algorithms are reaching their conclusions [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>]. Such considerations in the wider artificial intelligence community have led to the burgeoning field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>], which addresses the need to increase transparency and user trust in machine-learning algorithms. Explanations in the gamma-ray spectral domain will enable end users to not only have trust in the results, but also to more efficiently understand and adjudicate alarms during field operations.</p><p>Some researchers have taken note and made the first attempts to apply XAI techniques to the outputs of these new machine-learning approaches [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]. In reference [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>] the authors apply saliency mapping [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>], which gives a clear result for the activations of <sup>137</sup>Cs, namely that the 662 keV region is most important in identifying the presence of that isotope. However, they found that saliency sometimes failed to provide a useful explanation, such as when it was applied to an <sup>241</sup>Am spectrum, where saliency showed no activation with respect to the strong 60 keV line from the isotope. In reference [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>], SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>] was used to examine the results of models that determine uranium enrichment levels from high purity germanium (HPGe) detector spectra. SHAP was able to indicate the correct peak regions corresponding to the different uranium isotopes and the strength and direction of their influence on the enrichment result, although they were not clear about the details of how SHAP was calculated for their data, such as what type of scheme was used to mask out or disable spectral features. Reference [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>] implemented and compared several explanation methods for use with low resolution plastic scintillator spectra. The gradient-based methods of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>], Integrated Gradients (IG) [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>], and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>] are compared to the black-box methods Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>] and SHAP [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>]. Their conclusion was that Grad-CAM and LIME give unusable results, IG and LRP are possibly useful, and SHAP gives results that seem highly relevant and intuitive. However, since LIME and SHAP are closely related methods, it is unlikely that their performance would be so different. With few details about the implementations used for LIME and SHAP, it is difficult to infer the cause of this discrepancy. Taken together, the conclusions so far are that some approaches appear to yield better and more intuitive results than others, and that the best methods indicate that the models generally use the isotope-specific photopeak regions (or Compton-edge regions in the case of the plastic scintillator detectors in reference [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]) to determine the model outputs. However, there is also a need for a deeper understanding and articulation of the application of these methods to spectral data, particularly in cases where the gamma-ray spectra are more complex as is the case for most nuclear material.</p><p>In this work we focus on the problem of spectral detection and identification in urban search using simulated NaI(Tl) detectors, which are considered to have moderate energy resolution. We implement some of the explanation methods that have been explored by others and find that in some cases modifications are needed to more fully adapt those methods for gamma-ray spectral data (<a href=\"#sec002\">Explanation methods</a>). These modifications have not been noted in other work and may account for the mixed results seen across the methods. We also propose a method for producing counterfactual explanations, i.e., why the model predicted one class over another. To demonstrate these methods, we use an ANN model that is consistent with recent literature and trained on the latest in synthetic data for urban search (Data and model). Finally, we show the results of using these explanation methods (<a href=\"#sec013\">Results</a>) and discuss their implications (<a href=\"#sec014\">Discussion</a>), specifically that black box explanation tools are preferred, and Kernel SHAP has an advantage over LIME of requiring little to no hyperparameter optimization. We also note that the gradient-based methods appear to be useful but can have unpredictable outcomes for low energy sources, possibly because the spectra contain orders of magnitude more counts at the low end than at other portions of the spectrum. In addition, we demonstrate the utility of counterfactual explanations with a specific example.</p><h2>Explanation methods</h2><p>The common notation we will use for the explanation methods is that we have a model <em>f</em> that takes a spectrum <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e001\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span> with <em>N</em> bins as input, and outputs <em>C</em> class scores <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e002\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span>. These scores are assumed to be the output logits before the softmax function that is typically used to normalize the outputs of models. The specific data point at issue (rather than the generic input) is <strong>x</strong><sub>0</sub>, and bolding will be dropped when indexing individual vector elements.</p><p>Explanations will be denoted as <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e003\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span>, where <em>M</em> ≤ <em>N</em> is the dimension of the explanation space. If <em>M</em> &lt; <em>N</em> then <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e004\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span> will be expanded proportionally to cover all <em>N</em> input dimensions, and this is done in all figures showing explanations.</p><h3>Saliency mapping</h3><p>Saliency mapping [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>] was first proposed in 2013 as a means of interpreting the output of the latest generation of deep neural networks with high achievement on the ImageNet problem [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>]. This method gave researchers some of their first insights into the overall operation of deep and complex ANNs. Saliency mapping was first used for gamma-ray spectra in reference [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>].</p><p>A saliency map is the gradient of the output (e.g., the class score <em>y</em><sub><em>c</em></sub> for class <em>c</em>, before the final softmax) with respect to the input data <strong>x</strong>, evaluated on the original input data <strong>x</strong><sub>0</sub>:\\n<a name=\"pone.0286829.e005\" id=\"pone.0286829.e005\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e005\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(1)</span></span></p><p>Typically, the absolute value of <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e006\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span> is taken and scaled to the range [0, 1], but we will examine the raw gradient here.</p><p>Saliency, of course, requires that the model be differentiable. Since our models are implemented in Tensorflow library [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>], this gradient can be calculated automatically.</p><h3>Grad-CAM</h3><p>Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was introduced as a way of visualizing which regions of an image contribute most strongly to a particular class score [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>]. Grad-CAM requires that at least one layer of the model is convolutional, and it weights the gradients of the class score with respect to the final convolutional layer by the activations of that layer itself. Assuming <em>A</em><sub><em>ij</em></sub>(<strong>x</strong><sub>0</sub>) is the activation of filter <em>j</em> (out of a total of <em>J</em>) at index <em>i</em> (out of a total of <em>M</em>) for the last convolutional layer in the model, then the Grad-CAM explanation is defined to be\\n<a name=\"pone.0286829.e007\" id=\"pone.0286829.e007\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e007\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(2)</span></span></p><p>However, this formula led to unusual outputs with our model and data. The culprit seemed to be the wide dynamic range of a single spectrum—by averaging the gradient over the spectral dimension (<em>i</em>′) first, large gradients, especially near the low energy portion of the spectrum where there may be orders of magnitude more counts than higher energy regions, were overly influencing the resulting mean gradients. We observed that if those gradients were not averaged but were instead first multiplied by the activations, then the activations would serve to suppress the spurious high gradients, resulting in more understandable outputs.</p><p>In other words, the modification to Grad-CAM that was suitable for our spectra was to remove the gradient averaging and leave only the sum over the filter dimension,\\n<a name=\"pone.0286829.e008\" id=\"pone.0286829.e008\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e008\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(3)</span></span></p><p>The need to modify Grad-CAM serves to underline how methods developed for image data, which in general have lower dynamic ranges than gamma-ray spectra, may not necessarily give sensible results when used without modification, and care must be taken to ensure they are working as expected in the new context.</p><h3>LIME</h3><p>LIME was proposed in 2016 as a way of making more robust explanations by creating local linear (and thus interpretable) versions of the model [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>]. The basic principle is to repeatedly perturb the input data randomly and evaluate the model on those perturbations, and then to build a low-dimensional linear model that, at least in the neighborhood around the input data, closely approximates the original model. By examining the intrinsically more interpretable linear model, one can identify the main features of the input data that influenced the model’s output.</p><p>Open source code for LIME is available [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>], but we wrote our own version. To implement LIME, one needs three main ingredients: a scheme for masking the input data, a kernel for measuring the “distance” between different inputs, and a method for determining the optimal number of linearized features.</p><p>Masking is performed by selecting a number <em>M</em> ≤ <em>N</em> simplified input dimensions, with the choice of <em>M</em> chosen generally to speed up computation. Each mask is represented by a simplified input <strong>z</strong> ∈ {0, 1}<sup><em>M</em></sup>, and <strong>z</strong> is converted to a masked version of <strong>x</strong><sub>0</sub> using the mapping function\\n<a name=\"pone.0286829.e009\" id=\"pone.0286829.e009\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e009\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(4)</span></span></p><p>This mapping function is shared by SHAP and will be described in Method for masking spectral regions for LIME and SHAP.</p><p>The kernel for LIME is\\n<a name=\"pone.0286829.e010\" id=\"pone.0286829.e010\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e010\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(5)</span></span>\\nwhere <em>D</em>(<strong>x</strong><sub>1</sub>, <strong>x</strong><sub>2</sub>) is a distance metric between two spectra, and <em>σ</em> is a distance scale parameter.

The name for these payoffs are Shapley values, and in SHAP they take the place of the LIME coefficients.</p><p>Open source code is available [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>], but, as was the case with LIME, we wrote our own code that used the masking scheme described in Method for masking spectral regions for LIME and SHAP.</p><p>To be calculated exactly, SHAP requires evaluating the class score for all possible masks except the mask of all zeros and the mask of all ones (i.e., 2<sup><em>M</em></sup>−2 masks in total). Fortunately, the Shapley values can be approximated using only a random subset of all possible masks. This approximation is called Kernel SHAP [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>] and is found by recasting LIME through the following definitions:\\n<a name=\"pone.0286829.e018\" id=\"pone.0286829.e018\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e018\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(10)</span></span> <a name=\"pone.0286829.e019\" id=\"pone.0286829.e019\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e019\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(11)</span></span> <a name=\"pone.0286829.e020\" id=\"pone.0286829.e020\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e020\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(12)</span></span>\\nwhere ‖<strong>z</strong>‖<sub>0</sub> is the metric that counts the nonzero elements of <strong>z</strong>, and <strong>0</strong><sub><em>M</em></sub> and <strong>1</strong><sub><em>M</em></sub> are masks of all zeros and ones, respectively.

The mapping from mask to spectrum is summarized by the mapping function <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e021\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span>. For the equivalent of image superpixels, so that computation efficiency of LIME and SHAP can be increased, the user is allowed to choose <em>M</em> contiguous spectral regions, such that <em>M</em> is less than or equal to the number of spectral bins <em>N</em>. The regions then consist of <em>M</em> sets of ≈<em>N</em>/<em>M</em> adjacent bins (with rounding to the nearest integer). For a given mask <strong>z</strong> ∈ {0, 1}<sup><em>M</em></sup>, the spectral regions to be masked out are indicated by where the values of <strong>z</strong> are zero.</p><p>For image data, both LIME and SHAP replace masked image superpixels with a representative mean color. In LIME, the choice is to mask using the mean of each color channel over the entire image, typically leading to a shade of gray. In SHAP, numerous options are used, including in-filling with the average color of neighboring regions. (These choices are not explained in the original papers [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>], but have been implemented in the corresponding open source codes [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>].) The purpose of “graying out” superpixels is to convert the original image regions into regions that do not have any features that result in any significant class activations, thus allowing the method to effectively disable the effects from the masked superpixels.</p><p>For gamma-ray spectra, since spectral bin values can vary over orders of magnitude in a single spectrum, inserting the mean value of the spectrum into a masked region would be a poor choice, since doing so could lead to the injection of highly unusual spectral features with unpredictable class activations. Inserting the mean value of neighboring spectral bins would be more suitable and lead to more natural-looking spectra. Other options we considered are to linearly interpolate between the values on the boundary of the masked region, or to linearly interpolate in the logarithm of the values. In reference [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>], which used SHAP, and reference [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>], which used LIME in addition to SHAP, it is not clear in either case what type of scheme was used to disable spectral features.</p><p>We found an additional way of masking gamma-ray spectra that resulted in the most stable class activations. The basic idea is to insert appropriately scaled portions of the mean background spectral shape, making the masked regions locally resemble the mean background and thus be unlikely to activate any non-background classes. The mean background spectral shape <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e022\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span> is calculated from all the spectra labeled as background in the training set, by taking the simple mean of all of the spectral bins.

In other words, if the simplified inputs <strong>z</strong> indicate a spectral region from <em>i</em><sub>0</sub> to <em>i</em><sub>1</sub> (inclusive) is to be masked, then the <em>i</em>th element of the masked spectrum, assuming <em>i</em> is within that region, is\\n<a name=\"pone.0286829.e024\" id=\"pone.0286829.e024\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e024\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(13)</span></span></p><p>Among the implications here are that when all elements of <strong>z</strong> are zero, this method results in the entire mean background spectrum scaled by the gross counts of <strong>x</strong>:\\n<a name=\"pone.0286829.e025\" id=\"pone.0286829.e025\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e025\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(14)</span></span></p><p>An analogous process would not be suitable for most image datasets, since the visual field usually changes a much greater amount than the mean spectral shape of gamma-ray data.</p><p>An example of applying these different masking methods to a spectrum is shown in <a href=\"#pone-0286829-g001\">Fig 1</a>.

An explanation need not be calculated only for the best class score; indeed any class score can be used, so in these cases multiple explanations can be generated, one for each of the most likely sources. However, since sources that could be easily confused by the model tend to have features in the same region(s) of the spectrum, the multiple explanations on their own may not be helpful to a user when adjudicating the results. Instead, one may want to generate a <em>counterfactual</em> explanation for why one class was deemed more likely than the other, and such an explanation may reveal the features that most strongly distinguish between the two classes [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>].</p><p>To examine the contrast between two explanations <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e026\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span> and <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e027\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span>, we considered them each as two real-valued vectors in a Euclidean space (e.g., <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e028\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span> in the case of LIME and Kernel SHAP). Since the classes are both likely, the two explanations may be largely colinear, so the largest contrast between the explanations is in how they are orthogonal. In particular, assuming <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e029\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span> to be the higher confidence explanation and <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e030\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span> the weaker one, we propose using the negative of the orthogonal projection of <em>ϕ</em><sub>2</sub> onto <em>ϕ</em><sub>1</sub> as a technique for explaining why class 1 should be chosen over class 2, i.e.,\\n<a name=\"pone.0286829.e031\" id=\"pone.0286829.e031\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e031\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(15)</span></span></p><p>An example of such a counterfactual explanation will be shown in Results.</p><p>For the explanation methods that use random masking (LIME and Kernel SHAP), we found the counterfactual explanations most clear when <em>ϕ</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>ϕ</em><sub>2</sub> were calculated using the same set of random masks, by, e.g., supplying both methods with the same random seed.</p><h2>Data and model</h2><p>Here we will describe the data set used to train machine-learning models for spectral anomaly detection and identification, and the optimized model and its performance. This model and these data will be used in Explanation methods to demonstrate the explanation methods.</p><h3>The dataset and its preparation</h3><p>The data used were derived from the RADAI dataset [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>]. The RADAI dataset is the result of modeling an urban area to generate realistic radiological backgrounds, including <sup>40</sup>K, <sup>238</sup>U, and <sup>232</sup>Th series emission from buildings, road materials, and soil; <sup>214</sup>Pb and <sup>214</sup>Bi emission from horizontal surfaces during rain events; cosmic-induced gamma-ray backgrounds; scattering and attenuation from people and vehicle clutter; and other effects.</p><p>In addition to backgrounds, 24 sources of various kinds were present in many encounters throughout the dataset. These sources emerged from point-like sources and comprised a number of types—naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) anomalies, medical sources, industrial sources, and nuclear material—and contained various levels of shielding. The 24 source anomaly types (non-background) used in this study are listed in <a href=\"#pone-0286829-t001\">Table 1</a>.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.t001</a></p><p>For each isotope, the dataset contained at least 30 “runs” of 3–5-minutes in duration that consisted of encounters with the source in different physical locations of the city blocks. The runs were divided into training runs and validation runs, with 60% of the runs used for training, 20% for validation and 20% used for testing. The list-mode data from each run were integrated into one-second long spectra, and source- and background-tagged events were binned separately.</p><p>The spectra were binned into 256 nonlinear bins, spaced from 15 to 3000 keV. In order to approximate the energy resolution as a function of energy, a square-root binning scheme was used, i.e., the <em>j</em>-th bin edge (<em>j</em> = 0…256 inclusive) was\\n<a name=\"pone.0286829.e032\" id=\"pone.0286829.e032\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e032\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(16)</span></span></p><p>This scheme is similar to the nonlinear scheme used in reference [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>]. The intention behind this nonlinear binning scheme here and in that reference is to reduce the dimensionality of the spectral data without losing information, since no natural spectral features can appear that are at a higher resolution than the detector energy resolution.</p><p>Training, validation, and testing data were augmented in the following way. Binomial downsampling was applied to the <em>background</em> list-mode events using a probability randomly selected between 0.5 and 1.0. Binomial downsampling was applied to the <em>source</em> list-mode events with a probability randomly chosen logarithmically between 1 × 10<sup>−6</sup> and 1 × 10<sup>0</sup>. Augmented spectra were retained so long as the number of source events to total events in the downsampled spectrum was above 1% (unless background spectra were being generated, in which case all spectra were accepted). In this way 20,000 spectra for each source type (including background) were created for the training set, and 5,000 spectra of each kind for the validation and testing sets. The tools for data generation and augmentation that were used are in the open source <span class=\"monospace\">radai</span> repository [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref045\" class=\"ref-tip\">45</a>].</p><h3>Model for detection and identification</h3><p>For demonstration purposes in this paper, we will use a simple ANN and apply it to the classification problem for spectra, i.e., determining whether a spectrum is background or whether it contains any of the 24 kinds of anomalies, and if so, which one. The models used were inspired by the architectures used by [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>], and consisted of two 1-D convolutional layers, each followed by a max pooling layer, followed by two fully connected layers each followed by dropout, and a finally fully connected layer activated by a softmax to the final 25 outputs. As used in references [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>], the input spectra were first preprocessed by dividing by the maximum bin value to scale all of the bin values to be between 0 and 1, i.e., <strong>x</strong> → <strong>x</strong>/max(<strong>x</strong>). Unlike reference [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>], the outputs were not fractional abundances but categorical probabilities, so the training was done with one-hot representations of the labels. The models were optimized by minimizing sparse cross entropy, and the Adam optimizer [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref046\" class=\"ref-tip\">46</a>] was used, with a batch size of 1024, a learning rate of 1 × 10<sup>−4</sup>, and early stopping after 20 epochs if the validation-set loss has not decreased. The model was implemented in Keras [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref047\" class=\"ref-tip\">47</a>] and Tensorflow [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>] versions 2.11.0.</p><p>The best model was found by a random search over the parameter set given in <a href=\"#pone-0286829-t002\">Table 2</a>, and the full details of the model architecture are listed in <a href=\"#pone-0286829-t003\">Table 3</a>.

The overall accuracy of the model in identifying the 25 categories was 30.9%. The identification performance can be seen in the confusion matrix in <a href=\"#pone-0286829-g003\">Fig 3</a>, which shows the predicted class label for each of the true class labels. The dataset was meant to be challenging to the algorithm, so a large number of spectra are identified as background. Some anomaly classes are more easily distinguished from background than others, such as <sup>133</sup>Xe, which has strong emission at the lowest part of the spectrum. Other low energy sources, such as <sup>241</sup>Am and <sup>201</sup>Tl, also have better detection performance than other source types. Aside from detection performance, some anomaly types have poor identification performance, especially refined uranium (RefinedU), fuel-grade plutonium (FGPu), and weapons-grade plutonium (WGPu). For example, FGPu can be seen to have strong cross-talk with both <sup>241</sup>Am and WGPu, which explains where the wrong identifications are primarily being made. Though not shown here, the confusion between these three classes persists even at high SNR values. Other notable features in the confusion matrix are the significant crosstalk groups formed by the different forms of uranium (depleted uranium (DU), refined uranium, low enriched uranium (LEU)) and the different plutonium-related anomalies (<sup>241</sup>Am, FGPu, and WGPu).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec3.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec3.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>The confusion matrix for the 25 spectrum categories obtained by evaluating the model on the testing set.</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.g003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.g003</a></p><h2>Results</h2><p>To examine the different explanation methods, we applied them to spectra from the testing set. We began by examining spectra where the algorithm both correctly detected a non-background class and correctly identified the source. One of the most straightforward cases is <sup>137</sup>Cs, which consists of a single photopeak at 662 keV with an associated continuum of downscattered events. <a href=\"#pone-0286829-g004\">Fig 4</a> shows the four explanation methods applied to a spectrum that truly contained <sup>137</sup>Cs and that the model identified as <sup>137</sup>Cs with 98.7% confidence. For convenience and to highlight the most obvious non-background features, the mean background scaled to match the gross counts of the spectrum is overlaid on each plot, and the deviance residuals from this scaled mean background (i.e., signed square root of the individual terms in the sum in <a href=\"#pone.0286829.e011\">Eq 6</a>, which are approximately the standardized residuals for Poisson data) from this simple fit are plotted beneath. In addition, the spectrum of only those events known to be from the source (because each event is tagged by its origin in the RADAI dataset) is also plotted to qualitatively verify whether the explanations are able to identify the actual regions of highest importance. In the case of <sup>137</sup>Cs, the four methods do indeed identify the region around the 662 keV photopeak as the most important, which can be seen as also being the region with the highest signal-to-background and where there is a distinct positive residual from the mean background shape. Of note are that LIME and Kernel SHAP return nearly identical results both in distribution and magnitude. (Here and in what follows, LIME and Kernel SHAP use a simplified input size of <em>M</em> = 64, or “superpixels” consisting of groups of every four spectral bins, and LIME is calculated using <em>K</em> = 10.).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec4.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec4.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>A comparison of the four explanation methods considered here for a spectrum containing a medium energy source, <sup>137</sup>Cs.

In this case, the results diverged significantly between the methods. The two gradient-based methods failed to correctly identify the region where the source was the strongest, with the saliency map having large gradients throughout the spectrum and not just in the region 40–80 keV, where most of the source events are. In addition, Grad-CAM highlighted only the first several bins, below 40 keV. These problems may be due to how non-uniform the data in each spectrum can be—here the nonzero elements of the spectrum vary over more than two orders of magnitude, with the highest counts at the low end of the spectrum. It may be that the gradients in the low energy region can dominate in unpredictable ways because of this. Indeed, issues with the uniformity of the gradient had to be dealt with earlier in modifying Grad-CAM (Grad-CAM), since its original outputs were often nonsensical when tested with spectral data. Some initial testing with models trained using logarithmic normalization of the data (as was done in [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]) seems to mitigate some of these effects, at least for saliency mapping.</p><p>Meanwhile, LIME and Kernel SHAP again produced outcomes in close agreement with each other, and both highlight the 60–80 keV region, which is at the higher end of the region with the most source counts. This emphasis on the 60–80 keV region may be because of other source types (e.g., <sup>241</sup>Am and the types of plutonium) that have strong features at 60 keV and below, giving that region higher specificity to this particular isotope.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec4.fig2.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec4.fig2.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>A comparison of the four explanation methods considered here for a spectrum with a low energy source, <sup>201</sup>Tl.

One of the clearest and most important examples is weapons-grade plutonium (WGPu), which, when unshielded has a dominant 60 keV line from <sup>241</sup>Am, but when shielded the signature is primarily characterized by a complex of lines around 350–400 keV. <a href=\"#pone-0286829-g006\">Fig 6</a> shows the results of saliency mapping and Kernel SHAP for two such spectra. In both cases, the methods generally highlight the correct regions, but saliency mapping has more extraneous nonzero values throughout the rest of the spectrum, even in areas where there are few to no source counts, showing that saliency mapping could potentially cause confusion for the end user.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec4.fig3.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec4.fig3.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>A comparison of saliency (top) and Kernel SHAP (bottom) for unshielded (left) and shielded (right) weapons-grade plutonium sources (WGPu).

The explanations for the two isotopes using Kernel SHAP reveal qualitatively similar distributions, though with slightly different overall scales. For both isotopes, the region around 330–420 keV is found to be important, which comports with the intuition that the strongest photopeaks of the two isotopes are their most distinguishing features (364 keV for <sup>131</sup>I and 356 keV for <sup>133</sup>Ba). However, the energy resolution is too large to distinguish those two photopeaks from each other, so it would be useful for adjudication purposes to find out how the model has been able to find other means of contrast between the two isotopes. The bottom plot of <a href=\"#pone-0286829-g007\">Fig 7</a> shows the counterfactual explanation <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286829.e033\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span>, i.e., the most important features for choosing <sup>131</sup>I over <sup>133</sup>Ba. This explanation is illustrative, since it reveals a moderate importance of the region of approximately 600–650 keV, which is where <sup>131</sup>I has a significant photopeak (637 keV) but <sup>133</sup>Ba does not. Additionally, the slight excess of events in the region 250–300 keV are assigned negative values, indicating that their existence provides support for the presence of <sup>133</sup>Ba. This result makes sense because <sup>133</sup>Ba has two significant lines in that region (276 keV with 7% branching and 303 keV with 18% branching), while <sup>131</sup>I has fewer relevant photopeaks there (284 keV with 6% branching) [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref048\" class=\"ref-tip\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec4.fig4.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec4.fig4.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>Kernel SHAP used for explanations of the class score for <sup>131</sup>I (top left), which is the true anomaly contained by the spectrum, and an explanation of the class score for <sup>133</sup>Ba, to which the model also gave significant confidence.

The spectrum actually contains <sup>133</sup>Xe, but it has been assigned a confidence of only 15.6%, while <sup>201</sup>Tl has been assigned 84.3%. In the range 50–100 keV, which the explanations indicate are the most important region for both isotopes, <sup>133</sup>Xe has only one prominent line at 81.0 keV (36.9%), while <sup>201</sup>Tl has several, ranging from 68.9 to 82.5 keV (90.7% total among them) [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref048\" class=\"ref-tip\">48</a>]. Thus <sup>133</sup>Xe’s emission should be generally higher than that from <sup>201</sup>Tl, however the true source-only spectrum indicates that the actual anomalous emission is peaked around 50–60 keV, likely due to shielding of the source.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec4.fig5.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec4.fig5.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>Kernel SHAP used for explanations of the class score for <sup>133</sup>Xe (top left), which is the true source present, but the model incorrectly assigned a higher confidence to <sup>201</sup>Tl (top right).

The counterfactual explanation is strongly negative in the region approximately 90-100 keV, indicating that the model saw less emission in that region than expected for <sup>133</sup>Xe, and that is why the confidence is lower for it. Examining a case like this may indicate to a researcher that more development is needed to correctly distinguish between these two isotopes when there is shielding, potentially guiding the collection of more training data or the pursuit of other model architectures.</p><h2>Discussion</h2><p>Methods to explain the outputs of machine-learning models provide context that the model’s predictions on their own do not. In gamma-ray spectroscopy, and in the particular application of anomaly detection and identification in urban search, these explanations can provide insights into which regions of the spectrum are most important. As others have noted, these regions tend to be those where there are important features such as isotope-specific photopeaks [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>].</p><p>However, there are additional complexities in applying explanation tools to spectral data. The first is that the gradient-based methods we explored (saliency mapping and Grad-CAM) seem to become distorted at the lower energies. We suspect that the gradients become dominated by their values at low energies, which are orders of magnitude higher than other regions of the spectrum, and that if these tools are to be useful going forward then some adequate regularization must be found. To deal with the low energy effects, we had to modify Grad-CAM to suppress the effects of low-energy gradients, although the result was not entirely successful. These problems with gradients at the lowest energies may be behind the unusual result seen in the saliency map for <sup>241</sup>Am in reference [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>], where the clearly visible 60 keV line was not highlighted by the method, while the higher energy photopeak regions of <sup>137</sup>Cs and <sup>60</sup>Co were correctly found. The <sup>241</sup>Am result was especially surprising given that the model’s performance on <sup>241</sup>Am is nearly 100% perfect according to the confusion matrix.</p><p>An additional lesson is that some explanation tools require masking of the input data features in a way that is appropriate for the data. The default masking behavior implemented in open source versions of the black box methods like LIME and SHAP may work well for images and other data but not for spectra. For example, inserting the mean value of the data into the masked regions might work for images, but creates highly distorted gamma-ray spectra. Linearly interpolating masked regions leads to more stable class scores for randomly masked spectra, and we found that inserting scaled regions of the mean background shape worked even better. The existing applications of LIME [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>] and SHAP [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>] in the literature do not clearly specify how masking was done, although their results support the usefulness of SHAP.</p><p>Another result of this paper is that LIME and Kernel SHAP are found to give comparable and nearly identical results. This coincidence is not surprising given that SHAP is a generalization of LIME [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>]. These results are at odds with reference [<a href=\"#pone.0286829.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>], where LIME is found to return different (and useless) results compared to SHAP. However, in that paper, in addition to the masking scheme, the hyperparameters used for LIME were not stated, such as which method was used for determining the optimal number of nonzero linear coefficients <em>K</em>, and which parameters were used when performing any relevant Lasso or ridge regressions. Without knowing these choices, one cannot conclude whether LIME was truly useless for those data, or whether it had not been properly tuned.</p><p>The necessity for tuning LIME, including specifying a distance metric, a masking scheme, and a method for finding <em>K</em>, gives it more drawbacks than Kernel SHAP. Kernel SHAP shares with LIME a need for a masking scheme, a method for dividing a spectrum into a desired number (<em>M</em>) of “superpixels,” and an adequate number of random masks to generate. (Care should be taken to use the Kernel SHAP approach and not the full Shapley value calculation, which requires evaluating the model for <em>all</em> possible masks.) Therefore, of all the methods we examined, based on the findings of this work we recommend the general adoption of Kernel SHAP over the other methods.</p><p>Lastly, we found that a user of complex spectral models could benefit not just from explanations, but also from explanations of contrast between other likely outcomes. We propose the orthogonal projection of Kernel SHAP explanations as a simple and effective way to derive such an explanation. Second-order analytical tools, like these explanations of class contrast, have not been explored in this application space but are a natural extension of them.</p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>The authors thank Brian J.

It is unclear if total dietary intake of added sugar also increases the risk for prediabetes. This study examined if total (g/day) and percent intakes of &lt;10%, 10–15%, or &gt;15% added sugar increase the odds for prediabetes in U.S. adults. A cross-sectional, secondary analysis using 2013–2018 NHANES data was conducted. This study included data from U.S. adults ≥ 20 years with normoglycemia (N = 2,154) and prediabetes (N = 3,152) with 1–2 days of dietary recall information. Prediabetes was defined as a hemoglobin A1c of 5.7%-6.4% or a fasting plasma glucose of 100–125 mg/dL. Survey-weighted logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios of prediabetes based on usual intakes of added sugar (total and percent intakes) using the National Cancer Institute Method. Differences in prediabetes risk and total and percent intakes of added sugar were compared by race/ethnicity. The sample’s total energy intake from added sugar was 13.9%. Total (unadjusted: OR: 1.01, 95% CI: .99–1.00, <em>p</em> = .26; adjusted: OR: 1.00, 95% CI: .99–1.00, <em>p</em> = .91) and percent intakes of added sugar (unadjusted [&lt;10%: (ref); 10–15%: OR: .93, 95% CI: .77–1.12, <em>p</em> = .44; &gt;15%: OR: 1.03, 95% CI: .82–1.28, <em>p</em> = .82] and adjusted [&lt;10%: (ref); 10–15%: OR: .82, 95% CI: .65–1.04, <em>p</em> = .09; &gt;15%: OR: .96, 95% CI: .74–1.24, <em>p</em> = .73]) were not significantly associated with an increased odds of prediabetes. Prediabetes risk did not differ by race/ethnicity for total (unadjusted model [<em>p</em> = .65]; adjusted model [<em>p</em> = .51]) or percent (unadjusted model [<em>p</em> = .21]; adjusted model [<em>p</em> = .11]) added sugar intakes.

Significant disparities in the prevalence of prediabetes are observed among minority populations, particularly for non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic adults, in comparison to non-Hispanic White adults (32%, 35.3% vs 31%, respectively) [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>]. Prediabetes can be largely prevented with lifestyle modifications that include diet change [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>]. Yet, roughly 70% of adults with prediabetes will go on to develop T2D within their lifetime [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. Increased consumption of carbohydrates have been implicated in the rising incidence of T2D [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. During the late 1970s [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>] the first published U.S. Dietary Guidelines began encouraging reductions to dietary fat (i.e.,40% to 30% calories/day) while increasing carbohydrate intake to 55% - 60% calories/day [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. In line with this change, food manufacturers began substituting carbohydrates in lieu of fats, largely in the form of added sugars across a multitude of foods and beverages [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>], which have become a mainstay of the current U.S. diet [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>]. This shift paralleled a drastic rise in obesity and diabetes rates across the 1980s and 1990s [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>], a trend which persist today [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>].</p><p>Current dietary guidelines recommend consuming 10% or less of one’s daily calories from added sugars, yet the average American consumes around 270 calories per day (~13% of one’s daily calories) [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. Added sugars, which are caloric sweeteners added to foods and beverages during processing, preparation, or prior to consumption [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>], include forms such as sucrose, used predominately in solid foods, and high-fructose corn (HFCS), used predominately in sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. Large cohort studies have consistently found a significant positive correlation between SSB consumption and T2D risk that is often dose dependent with greater consumption associated with a higher risk for T2D [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. Research suggests that chronic consumption of diets high in added sugar (i.e., ~15–25% total energy intake) [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>] are primarily responsible for T2D risk [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>] and are independent of total energy intake or body mass index (BMI) [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>]. However, studies assessing the relationships between added sugar consumption and prediabetes are limited with most having used added sugar proxies (i.e., SSBs, HFCS, and fructose-sweetened beverages) instead of assessing total intake from all dietary sources (i.e., foods and beverages) [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>].</p><p>Also of concern is that minority populations demonstrate significant health disparities in obesity and T2D prevalence in comparison to non-Hispanic White individuals [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref038\" class=\"ref-tip\">38</a>]. Moreover, consumption of a high carbohydrate diet in minority populations (i.e., non-Hispanic Black adults) has been shown to promote an exaggerated insulin response that occurs independent of overweight/obesity status [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>]. Non-Hispanic Black adults consume the greatest quantities of added sugar followed by non-Hispanic White adults, Hispanic adults, and non-Hispanic Asian adults (19 teaspoons (tsp), 17 tsp, 16 tsp, and 10 tsp respectively) [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>] raising the question as to whether differences in dietary intake from added sugar may contribute to these health disparities.</p><p>To date, no studies have examined if total dietary intake of added sugar increases the risk for prediabetes and if so, how much (e.g., &gt;15% total caloric intake) may be responsible for the increased risk observed. Also, it is unclear whether added sugar uniquely influences the risk for prediabetes by race and ethnicity, particularly among those that consume high quantities of added sugar (i.e., non-Hispanic Black adults). Therefore, the main objective of this study was to examine whether total added sugar consumption was associated with prediabetes in a large nationally representative sample of U.S. adults ≥20 years. Second, this study examined if total added sugar consumption, as a percentage of total energy intake (&lt;10%, 10–15%, &gt;15%), was associated with differing risk probabilities for prediabetes. Last, this study assessed if the associations between total and percent intakes of added sugar and prediabetes risk differed by race/ethnicity. The study’s guiding a priori hypothesis was that positive associations between total and percent added sugar intakes and prediabetes risk would be observed, including greater risk at higher added sugar intakes (e.g., &gt;15% total energy), and that significant risk differences would be observed by race/ethnicity with increased risk among high T2D risk groups.</p><h2>Materials and methods</h2><h3>Study design</h3><p>This study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) which is a repeated cross-sectional survey that employs a complex, multistage, probability sampling design to collect health and nutrition information from ~5,000 noninstitutionalized U.S. civilians (age 0 years and older) annually [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>]. NHANES is supported by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>]. Specific details about the design and operations of NHANES, including sampling and data collection procedures, have been previously described elsewhere [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>]. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted and included data collected from NHANES respondents ≥20 years during the 2013–2014, 2015–2016, and 2017–2018 NHANES cycles. NHANES study protocols are approved by the NCHS Research Ethnics Review Board [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref045\" class=\"ref-tip\">45</a>] and are compliant with the Health and Human Services Policy for Protection of Human Research Subjects (45 CFR part 46) [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref046\" class=\"ref-tip\">46</a>]. Only de-identified, publicly-available data were analyzed, therefore the study was designated as ‘Not Human Subjects Research’ by the University of Alabama at Birmingham [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref047\" class=\"ref-tip\">47</a>].</p><h3>Analytic sample</h3><p>The analytic sample included respondents ≥20 years of age with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) defined prediabetes or normoglycemia. Details about NHANES data collection processes and prediabetes classification and laboratory procedures are described in the supporting information file (S1 Appendix in <a href=\"#pone.0286759.s001\">S1 File</a>). Respondents represented the following NHANES racial and Hispanic origin groups: Hispanic (including Mexican American and other Latino populations), non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, Asian American, and Other Race which included persons not self-identifying with any of the prior categories. Appropriate sampling weights were applied to all analyses to account for the complex survey design and to ensure representativeness of the NHANES sample which includes non-institutionalized U.S. civilians [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref048\" class=\"ref-tip\">48</a>]. The initial weighted sample (taken from the fasting subsample) [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>] included a total of 5,888 respondents ≥20 years of age that excluded pregnant and lactating women (n = 115) and those taking insulin or diabetic medications (n = 963). An additional 167 respondents with T2D having either a HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) or a FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) were excluded resulting in 5,721 adults. Next, 415 adults were excluded due to not having at least 1 day of dietary recall information that contained a value for added sugar. The final sample included 5,306 adults with 3,152 respondents identified as having prediabetes (HbA1c 5.7% - 6.4% [39–47 mmol/mol] and FPG 100–125 mg/dL [5.6–6.9 mmol/L]) and 2,154 identified as having normoglycemia (HbA1c &lt;5.7% [&lt;39 mmol/mol] and FPG &lt;100 mg/dL [&lt;5.6 mmol/L]).</p><h3>Dietary intake assessment</h3><p>Dietary intake data, including added sugars and total calories, were collected for the dietary assessment component of NHANES which uses the 24-hour dietary recall method [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref049\" class=\"ref-tip\">49</a>]. Diet recalls are pre-announced and performed by trained interviewers using the validated U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Automated Multiple-Pass Method (AMPM) previously described elsewhere [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref049\" class=\"ref-tip\">49</a>]. The first diet recall is administered in-person during the mobile examination center visit (on either weekdays or weekends) and the second is administered over the phone 3–10 days later [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>].</p><p>Added sugars are defined as sugars, syrups, fruit juice concentrates, or caloric sweeteners added during processing, preparation, or prior to food and beverage consumption that exclude natural sugars present in dairy and fruit (including whole fruit and 100% fruit juice) [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref050\" class=\"ref-tip\">50</a>]. Estimates for added sugar were obtained from the Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED) of the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref051\" class=\"ref-tip\">51</a>]. Added sugars were reported in teaspoon equivalents consumed per subject, per day calculated from foods/beverages [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref050\" class=\"ref-tip\">50</a>]. Total calories from day 1 and day 2 dietary recalls were obtained from the NHANES nutrient intake files and were reported in kilocalories (kcals). The FPED files were merged with NHANES total nutrient intake files to combine estimates for added sugar and total calories. For this study, to reflect updates to nutrition facts labeling [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref052\" class=\"ref-tip\">52</a>], added sugar was converted from teaspoon equivalents to grams (1 teaspoon equivalent = 4.2 grams) and from grams to calories (1 gram = 4 kilocalories) for day 1 and day 2 dietary recalls before the final dataset merge [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref052\" class=\"ref-tip\">52</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref053\" class=\"ref-tip\">53</a>]. Once all 2013–2018 data files were merged, percent intake was calculated by dividing grams of added sugar by total calories which was categorized into three groups (&lt;10%, 10–15%, and &gt;15%). The groups represent dietary guideline recommendations (&lt;10%), average U.S. intake (~13%), and above average intake (&gt;15%) respectively [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>].</p><h3>Statistical analysis</h3><p>All analyses were performed using SAS Studio version 3.8, Enterprise Edition [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref054\" class=\"ref-tip\">54</a>]. NHANES analytic guidelines [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>] were followed using SAS procedures [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref055\" class=\"ref-tip\">55</a>] appropriate for complex survey designs. Survey data from 2013–2014, 2015–2016, and 2017–2018 were combined and appropriate sampling weights (from the fasting subsample WTSAF2YR) were created for the combined dataset and applied to all models prior to analyses to account for differential nonresponse and planned oversampling of certain subgroups [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>]. Data on characteristics were reported using means and standard errors for continuous variables and percentages and standard errors for categorical variables. Characteristics were reported for the overall sample and by normoglycemia or prediabetes status. Rao Scott chi square tests were used to examine differences in sample characteristics for categorical variables by normoglycemia and prediabetes status. Ordinary least squares regression was used to examine differences in sample characteristics for continuous variables by normoglycemia and prediabetes status.</p><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) method [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref056\" class=\"ref-tip\">56</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref057\" class=\"ref-tip\">57</a>] was used to estimate usual intake of added sugar and total caloric intake using day one and day two 24-hour dietary recall data. The NCI method requires two or more dietary recalls on nonconsecutive days for a random subset of the population to account for between- and within-person variation in intake and can be used to correct for measurement error when estimating usual intake of nutrients [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref056\" class=\"ref-tip\">56</a>]. A 2-step process was used to estimate usual intake of added sugar and total daily calories using the MIXTRAN and INDIVIT macros provided by the NCI [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref056\" class=\"ref-tip\">56</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref058\" class=\"ref-tip\">58</a>]. In step 1, the MIXTRAN macro was used to generate an \"amount-only” model of daily consumed nutrients (i.e., added sugar) using 24 hour dietary recall data on a transformed scale [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref058\" class=\"ref-tip\">58</a>]. Intake day of the week [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref059\" class=\"ref-tip\">59</a>] was included as a covariate in the MIXTRAN model to account for possible weekday or weekend day effects on dietary intake [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref060\" class=\"ref-tip\">60</a>]. In step 2, INDIVINT was used to estimate usual intake for total calories and added sugar with parameters estimated from step 1. The INDIVINT macro was selected because it can be used to predict individual nutrient intakes for use as predictors in a disease model [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref056\" class=\"ref-tip\">56</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref058\" class=\"ref-tip\">58</a>].</p><p>Survey weighted logistic regression was used to test whether usual intake of total and percent added sugar intakes were associated with an increased odds of prediabetes relative to normoglycemia. The fasting subsample WTSAF2YR weight was applied to all analyses. Usual intake of added sugar was modeled as a continuous variable (g/day) and non-linear associations for added sugar as a percentage of total energy intake were examined (&lt;10%, 10–15%, &gt;15% kcal/day). A dichotomous indicator for prediabetes was constructed from HbA1c and FPG values. To aid in interpretation, estimated risks for prediabetes by total added sugar (g/day) were reported for mean and tertial intakes. Additionally, estimated risks for prediabetes by percent intakes of added sugar were reported as &lt;10%, 10–15%, and &gt;15% total energy from added sugar in kcals/day. Adjusted models included the following covariates: age in years, gender, race/ethnicity, BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>), total energy intake (kcal/day), engagement in physical activity, smoking status, education level, and family poverty to income ratio (PIR) (S1 Appendix in <a href=\"#pone.0286759.s001\">S1 File</a>). An additional adjusted model that included additional dietary variables (dietary fiber, total fat, saturated fat, and total antioxidant capacity) was fitted to account for potential dietary effects that could confound the association between added sugar and prediabetes risk (S1 Appendix in <a href=\"#pone.0286759.s001\">S1 File</a>). Interaction terms between added sugar and race/ethnicity were used to examine differences in the relationship between prediabetes risk and total and percent added sugar intakes by race/ethnicity for non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Asian American and Other Race respondents. All tests were two-sided and a <em>p</em> value &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant.</p><h2>Results</h2><h3>Sample characteristics</h3><p>A total of 5,306 adults with normoglycemia (41% of the sample) and prediabetes (59%) were included in the weighted sample and reported consuming 13.9% of their total daily calories from added sugar. There were no statistically significant differences in consumption of added sugar between groups (normoglycemia vs. prediabetes). <a href=\"#pone-0286759-t001\">Table 1</a> shows the overall characteristics of adults ≥20 years and by normoglycemia and prediabetes status.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286759.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286759.t001</a></p><p>In the overall sample, the average age was 47 years and included more females (51.1%) than males (48.9%) and mostly non-Hispanic White adults (65.7%), followed by Hispanic including Mexican American and Latino (14.9%), non-Hispanic Black (10.8%), Asian American (4.8%), or Other Race (3.8%) adults. The majority of the sample had obesity (36.8%), reported engaging in moderate and/or vigorous physical activity (54.7%), reported being non-smokers (77.5%), had more than a high school degree (63.2%), and reported a family income that represented a PIR &gt;1.85 (67.8%). The average HbA1c was 5.4% and the average FPG was 101 mg/dL. Usual intakes for total calories were 2,067 kcal/day and usual intakes of total added sugar were 72 grams (290 kcal/day).</p><p>Comparing between participants (normoglycemia vs prediabetes), those with prediabetes were more likely to be older (51 years), to be male (54.2%), to identify as being of Hispanic including Mexican American (15.6%), Asian American (4.9%), or Other Race (4.3%), have overweight (34.9%) or obesity (43.7%), be less likely to engage in moderate and/or vigorous activity (50.1%), identify as a non-smoker (78.2%), report having a high school (26.2%) or less than high school degree (13.9%) and report a family income that represented a PIR &gt;1.85 (68.4%). Those with prediabetes had an average HbA1c of 5.6% and a FPG of 107 mg/dL compared to an average HbA1c of 5.2% and FPG of 93 mg/dL among adults with normoglycemia. Between the normoglycemia and prediabetes groups, total calories per day and added sugar intake was similar (2,084 vs 2,046 total kcal/day [<em>p</em> = .07]; 71 vs. 73 g/day added sugar [<em>p</em> = .26]; 285 vs. 293 kcal/day of added sugar [<em>p</em> = .26]). Total energy intake from added sugar for both groups was 13.9% (<em>p</em> = .92). Percent intakes of added sugar were also similar between groups (<a href=\"#pone-0286759-t001\">Table 1</a>).</p><h3>Added sugar intake and prediabetes risk</h3><h4>Total added sugar intakes.</h4><p>Findings from both unadjusted and adjusted models (<a href=\"#pone-0286759-t002\">Table 2</a>) indicated that total added sugar (g/day) intake did not significantly increase the odds of having prediabetes (unadjusted: OR: 1.01, 95% CI: .99–1.00, <em>p</em> = .26; adjusted: OR: 1.00, 95% CI: .99–1.00, <em>p</em> = .91). The addition of dietary variables to the model (fiber, total fat, saturated fat, and total antioxidant capacity) did not change this association (S1 Table in <a href=\"#pone.0286759.s001\">S1 File</a>). Differences in the odds for having prediabetes were observed for some covariates in the adjusted model. For example, being older, being Hispanic, Asian American or Other Race, and having obesity was associated with a greater odds of having prediabetes, whereas being a non-smoker or having an education beyond a high school degree (relative to no high school degree) was associated with a lower odds of having prediabetes (<a href=\"#pone-0286759-t002\">Table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286759.t002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286759.t002</a></p><p><a href=\"#pone-0286759-t003\">Table 3</a> reports the estimated probability (i.e., risk) for prediabetes at mean (73 g/day) and tertial intakes (43 g/day, 64 g/day, 93 g/day) for total added sugar estimated from unadjusted and adjusted models. In both unadjusted and adjusted models, differences in the estimated risk for prediabetes and total added sugar intake were not statistically significant (unadjusted: <em>p</em> = .26; adjusted: <em>p</em> = .91). For example, in the unadjusted model, the estimated risk for prediabetes at mean and tertial intakes for total added sugar ranged from 55.8% (mean) and from 55% to 55.6% to 56.4% (tertile). Estimated risk percentages were converted from the ‘estimates’ reported in <a href=\"#pone-0286759-t003\">Table 3</a> (e.g., .550 equates to 55%). Similarly, in the adjusted models, the estimated risk for prediabetes at mean and tertial intakes for total added sugar ranged from 60.7% (mean) and from 60.6% to 60.6% to 60.8% (tertile) indicating very little difference in estimated risk of prediabetes between varying amounts of total added sugar.

Similar to the findings for the total added sugar intake models (<a href=\"#pone-0286759-t003\">Table 3</a>), differences in the estimated risk for prediabetes in the percent intake models were relatively small and not statistically significant (unadjusted: <em>p</em> = .51; adjusted: <em>p</em> = .22). For example, in the unadjusted model, the estimated risk for prediabetes by percent intakes ranged from 54.3% to 56.1% to 56.7% and in the adjusted model ranged from 57.7% to 61.4% to 62.5% (<a href=\"#pone-0286759-t005\">Table 5</a>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286759.t005\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286759.t005</a></p><h3>Total and percent intake of added sugar by race and ethnicity</h3><p>Results from the sensitivity analyses (Tables <a href=\"#pone-0286759-t006\">6</a> and <a href=\"#pone-0286759-t007\">7</a>) indicated that the association between total and percent intakes of added sugar and risk for prediabetes did not differ by race/ethnicity (Type 3 tests for interaction of race/ethnicity by total added sugar: unadjusted model [<em>p</em> = .27]; adjusted model [<em>p</em> = .33] and percent intake of added sugar: unadjusted model [<em>p</em> = .21]; adjusted model [<em>p</em> = .11]).

In the study, added sugar accounted for 13.9% of the sample’s total energy intake. Similarly, total energy intake from added sugar in adults with normoglycemia and prediabetes was 13.9%. The findings of this study suggest that even after controlling for total calorie intake, BMI, and pertinent health behaviors/sociodemographic factors, all sources (i.e., total) of added sugar consumed as part of a usual diet, do not appear to significantly increase an individual’s odds for having prediabetes. Average intakes for added sugar in this study exceeded current dietary guideline recommendations and were very close to average intake estimates reported for the total U.S. population (13.9% total energy intake/290 calories per day vs. 13% total energy intake/270 calories per day respectively) [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>].</p><p>The main hypothesis of this study, that total added sugar consumption would be associated with and increase the risk of prediabetes, was not supported by the findings from this study. Nonetheless, the results are not in complete contrast to what has previously been reported in the literature. Evidence from both observational and experimental findings on this topic have been mixed with many studies suggesting that added sugar increases the risk for prediabetes [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>] and fewer studies reporting no such relationship [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref061\" class=\"ref-tip\">61</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref067\" class=\"ref-tip\">67</a>]. Yet, differences between study designs (observational vs experimental), characterization of prediabetes risk, inclusion of representative minority groups, and operationalization of added sugar (i.e., proxies such as SSB or fructose-only beverages used to represent total added sugar intake) lend themselves to the inconsistent findings between many studies.</p><p>For example, experimental and observational studies have used a wide range of glycemic variables to assess prediabetes risk. In experimental studies, insulin sensitivity has been measured using the hyperinsulinemic clamp [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref063\" class=\"ref-tip\">63</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref065\" class=\"ref-tip\">65</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref068\" class=\"ref-tip\">68</a>], the hepatic insulin sensitivity index [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>], or a 75 g oral-glucose tolerance test (OGTT) [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>] whereas insulin resistance has been measured via the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref062\" class=\"ref-tip\">62</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref064\" class=\"ref-tip\">64</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref066\" class=\"ref-tip\">66</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref069\" class=\"ref-tip\">69</a>]. In observational studies, HOMA-IR has commonly been used to assess insulin resistance [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>]. Interestingly, only a single, prospective cohort study has reported a significant association between added sugar and incident prediabetes measured via FPG and OGTT [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>]. In contrast, prediabetes risk in this study was defined using HbA1c and FPG. Because OGTT was not collected in the 2017–2018 NHANES dataset, it was not used to identify prediabetes. It is possible that including all prediabetes measurements (HbA1c, FPG, and OGTT) may have resulted in a significant association between added sugar and prediabetes risk.</p><p>Sample characteristics have also varied widely between studies with experimental studies predominately using a homogenous sample of either male-only [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref063\" class=\"ref-tip\">63</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref064\" class=\"ref-tip\">64</a>] or female-only participants [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref062\" class=\"ref-tip\">62</a>] whereas observational studies have mainly included heterogeneous samples [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>]. Most of the studies failed to consider differences in added sugar intake by race/ethnicity status which limits the generalizability of past findings. In this study, a diverse and heterogeneous sample was included to test whether the associations between added sugar consumption and prediabetes differed by race/ethnicity. The findings of this study do not indicate prediabetes risk differs by race/ethnicity status for total or percent added sugar intakes. However, one notable finding from this study was that the highest risk estimates for prediabetes (irrespective of added sugar intake) was observed among Asian American adults. This is of interest since national estimates indicate that Asian American adults have a lower prevalence of prediabetes in the U.S. compared to other racial/ethnic groups (i.e., 37.3% compared to 39.2% for non-Hispanic Black, and 38.7% for non-Hispanic White adults) [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. Research suggests Asian American adults often have higher rates of prediabetes at lower BMIs (underweight to obese class I) [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>]. Participants in this study were predominately overweight or obesity; however, differences in BMI status by race/ethnicity were not estimated. Future studies should specifically include Asian Americans to better characterize their prediabetes risk.</p><p>Operationalization of added sugar has also varied widely between studies. For example, a plethora of observational studies have primarily relied on added sugar proxies (e.g., SSB sweetened with HFCS) to approximate total added sugar intake which has been shown to be positively correlated with risk for prediabetes and T2D [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>]. Moreover, this relationship has been consistently observed in large prospective cohort studies in both the U.S. and Europe. Interestingly, studies have indicated that a dose relationship exists between SSB intake and T2D with &gt; 1 to 2 servings per day (~355 mL or 12 ounces) attributed to a greater risk [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. Notably, one study assessed 100% fruit juice and SSBs individually and combined as a single category (i.e., sugary beverages). Results indicated that ≥ 0.50 servings/day of sugary beverages, SSBs, and 100% fruit juice over 4 years was associated with a 16%, 9%, and 15% higher risk for T2D respectively [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]. Yet, a similar cohort study found that 100% fruit juice was not associated with T2D risk and in fact, greater intake (967 mL/week) was attributed to a decreased risk of T2D [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. Given the clear distinction between SSBs that contain added sugars and 100% fruit juices that contain natural sugars [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>], future studies should ensure that these beverages are clearly defined and categorized to ensure consistency in how added sugars are operationalized in the context of disease risk.</p><p>Other studies have used fructose to represent added sugar and have found that greater concentrations of fructose (15% to ≥ 25% of total calories) promote insulin resistance [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>], increase fasting plasma glucose concentrations [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>], and impair insulin sensitivity [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>]. Yet, in the U.S., a typical ad libitum diet consists of different types (e.g., sucrose, glucose, fructose, HFCS) of added sugar that are consumed in both solid and liquid form (e.g., baked goods or beverages like sodas and fruit drinks) [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref070\" class=\"ref-tip\">70</a>]. Aware of this knowledge, the objective of this study was to examine the relationship between all (i.e., total) added sugars (consumed as part of a usual diet) and risk for prediabetes among U.S. adults. Because this was a cross-sectional study, causal inferences could not be made to determine why total added sugar intake did not increase the risk for prediabetes in the study sample. With much of the literature pointing to SSBs as a driving factor for diabetes risk [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>], it may be that liquid sources (e.g., SSBs) of added sugar compared to solid sources (e.g., baked goods, confectionaries) pose a greater risk for prediabetes. This was beyond this scope of this study; however, a few studies have found that added sugar consumed from liquids are responsible for impaired glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance in children (8–10 years) [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref071\" class=\"ref-tip\">71</a>] and positively correlated with HOMA-IR in adults whereas similar correlations have not observed for solid food consumption [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref072\" class=\"ref-tip\">72</a>]. Experimental research is needed to explore these differences in the context of prediabetes.</p><p>Lastly, it should be noted that the findings from this study are not in complete contrast to what has been previously reported in the literature. In a study by Lowndes et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref066\" class=\"ref-tip\">66</a>], added sugar represented ~18% of the sample’s total energy intake and did not impair fasting glucose concentrations in adults without diabetes (pre- or type 2). In comparison, consumption of added sugar in this study was slightly lower than what was used in the study by Lowndes et al. It is possible that average intakes of ~14% to ~18% added sugar may not pose a significant risk for prediabetes in adults. However, experimental studies assessing varying intakes of total added sugar as part of an ad libitum diet are needed since Lowndes et al. supplemented sucrose to participants in liquid form (via unsweetened milk), which may have differing effects on risk for prediabetes [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref071\" class=\"ref-tip\">71</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref072\" class=\"ref-tip\">72</a>].</p><h3>Strengths and limitations</h3><p>This study has some major strengths. This is the first known study to assess the associations between total and percent intakes of added sugar and risk for prediabetes in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. Differences by race and ethnicity status were also examined to improve the generalizability of the study results. Additionally, the NCI method was used to estimate usual individual intakes for added sugar for use in a disease model which helps account for between- and within-person variation in intake [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref056\" class=\"ref-tip\">56</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref073\" class=\"ref-tip\">73</a>].</p><p>This study also has limitations. First, the cross-sectional nature of this study did not allow for the assessment of causal or temporal inferences between added sugar and risk for prediabetes. Second, self-reported 24-hour dietary recalls were used to estimate usual intake of added sugars and total calories which may be subject to under- or over-reporting due to concerns of social desirability [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref074\" class=\"ref-tip\">74</a>]. Optimal estimates for usual intake over a longer time period can be obtained using Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQ) [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref075\" class=\"ref-tip\">75</a>]. However, they were not utilized in this study due to their incompatibility with the NCI method to estimate usual dietary intake of added sugar in the context of a disease model [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref058\" class=\"ref-tip\">58</a>]. Third, HbA1c is reported to have a lower sensitivity at cut-points of 5.7–6.4% and is associated with greater diagnostic inaccuracy in the presence of certain medical conditions that increase red blood cell turnover (e.g., sickle cell disease, pregnancy, erythropoietin therapy)<sup>1</sup> and are not reported in NHANES. Differences by race and ethnicity status have also been reported with HbA1c levels registering higher in non-Hispanic Black adults compared to non-Hispanic White adults who had similar fasting glucose levels [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>]. It is possible some individuals were incorrectly classified as having prediabetes (or T2D); however, including both FPG and HbA1c likely improved identification of prediabetes among the study sample [<a href=\"#pone.0286759.ref076\" class=\"ref-tip\">76</a>].</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>This study found that added sugar averaged 13.9% of the sample’s total energy intake and was the same for adults with normoglycemia and prediabetes. Total and percent intakes of added sugar did not increase the risk for prediabetes in this nationally representative study of U.S. adults ≥20 years, including no significant differences in risk by race/ethnicity status. As this topic continues to evolve, additional experimental studies are needed to determine if there are any direct effects from consuming total added sugar, as part of a usual diet, on prediabetes risk. As rates of prediabetes and T2D continue to rise, evidence-based research should determine what role added sugar plays in diabetes management and prevention to help advance the field of precision health and nutrition.</p><h2>Supporting information</h2><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286759.s001\">S1 File. </a></h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286759.s001\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286759.s001</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(DOCX)</p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>The authors sincerely thank Dr. Greg Pavela for his conceptual, methodological, and statistical expertise required for completion of this manuscript and for his critical manuscript review.</p><h2>References</h2><h3>Subject Areas <div id=\"subjInfo\">?</div>\\n    <div id=\"subjInfoText\">\\n      <p>For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/PLOS/plos-thesaurus/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link opens in new window\">here</a>.</p>\\n      <span class=\"inline-intro\">We want your feedback.</span> Do these Subject Areas make sense for this article?

Previous novelty measures however had a few limitations. First, the majority of previous measures are based on recombinant novelty concept, attempting to identify a novel combination of knowledge elements, but insufficient effort has been made to identify a novel element itself (<em>element novelty</em>). Second, most previous measures are not validated, and it is unclear what aspect of newness is measured. Third, some of the previous measures can be computed only in certain scientific fields for technical constraints. This study thus aims to provide a validated and field-universal approach to computing element novelty. We drew on machine learning to develop a word embedding model, which allows us to extract semantic information from text data. Our validation analyses suggest that our word embedding model does convey semantic information. Based on the trained word embedding, we quantified the element novelty of a document by measuring its distance from the rest of the document universe. We then carried out a questionnaire survey to obtain self-reported novelty scores from 800 scientists. We found that our element novelty measure is significantly correlated with self-reported novelty in terms of discovering and identifying new phenomena, substances, molecules, etc. and that this correlation is observed across different scientific fields.</p><p><strong>Citation: </strong>Yin D, Wu Z, Yokota K, Matsumoto K, Shibayama S (2023) Identify novel elements of knowledge with word embedding.

Introduction</h2><p>Novelty constitutes a core value in science [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>]. Novelty serves as an important criterion for the assessment of scientific performance and for decision makings such as employment and funding allocation [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. It is thus critical that scientific novelty be reliably measured. Several bibliometric indicators for novelty have been proposed [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>], but there remain a few fundamental limitations.</p><p>First, most previous measures have not been validated. As novelty is a multifaceted concept, it is not entirely clear what aspect of novelty is captured or even whether novelty is measured at all. Second, the dominant approach of measuring novelty in previous studies appears to emphasize a specific type of novelty at the cost of overlooking other types. Namely, previous approaches mostly are based on the concept of <em>recombinant</em> novelty [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>], with which a scientific document is considered novel if it includes a new or rare combination of knowledge elements (e.g., keywords and cited references) [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. In contrast, few studies address the newness of a knowledge element itself [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>]. This is intriguing as the novelty of an element (\"element novelty\" hereafter), which serves as a building block of recombinant novelty, is conceptually and practically more fundamental [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>]. Third, due to technical constraints, some of the previous measures can only be computed in certain scientific fields, which is a critical flaw when the boundary of disciplines becomes increasingly ambiguous [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>]. This study thus aims to develop a validated and field-universal approach to computing scientific novelty based on the element novelty concept.</p><p>Element novelty being underserved is attributed to a few technical challenges. One simple approach to measure element novelty is to draw on text information and consider a document to be novel if it includes a new word [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>]. However, this approach faces a challenge when a document includes a new word that is merely a synonym of or similar to an existing word. Such an issue can be addressed by constructing controlled vocabulary dictionaries, but it requires substantial manual work and such efforts tend to be constrained within specific expertise areas.</p><p>To overcome these challenges, we drew on a natural language processing (NLP) technique to develop a word embedding model that covers all scientific fields. The technique extracts the semantic information of text data and maps each word onto a high-dimensional vector space [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>], which functions as a vocabulary dictionary. After validating that our word embedding model does capture semantic information, we apply the model to measure element novelty. Word embeddings allow us to quantify the distance between a pair of text data. Thus, we can measure distances between documents and thereby identify a <em>novel</em> document that is distant from other documents. To validate this novelty measure, we carried out a questionnaire survey, asking the authors of sampled scientific articles to self-evaluate multiple novelty aspects of the articles they authored. We confirm that our novelty measure is correlated with the self-reported novelty of a knowledge element in various scientific fields. We further compare our novelty measure with a few previous novelty measures and demonstrate the advantage of our approach.</p><p>The contribution of this study is twofold. First, this is the first to provide a validated and field-universal approach to computing element novelty. Second, our word embedding model offers a technical basis to interpret scientific text information, which can be applied not only for calculating novelty but also for describing other qualities of knowledge such as the diversity of a knowledge portfolio and the temporal evolution of knowledge [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>].</p><p>This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews previous novelty measures and technical backgrounds to compute novelty. Section 3 outlines the construction of the word embedding model and validates the model. Section 4 explains the operationalization of the novelty measure based on the word embedding and presents the result of validation analyses. Section 5 summarizes the results and conclude.</p><h2>2. Related works</h2><h3>2.1 Measures of novelty</h3><p>Novelty is one of the core values in science as it drives the progress of science fundamentally [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>]. Scientists can make novel contributions in various manners, such as proposing a new theory, discovering a new phenomenon, and developing a new method. For example, Guetzkow et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>] identified various dimensions of novelty (approach, theory, method, data, and findings) based on in-depth interviews of social scientists and suggested that relevant novelty dimensions can differ across scientific fields. Dirk [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>] conducted a questionnaire survey of life scientists and found that the respondents considered novelty in hypotheses more important than novelty in methods.</p><p>Given the multi-dimensionality of novelty, it is critical to understand what novelty aspect is captured by bibliometric novelty indicators, which has been insufficient due to limited validation efforts with a few exceptions [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>]. Nonetheless, previous measures are broadly categorized into two groups–recombinant novelty and element novelty–and thus might capture two aspects of novelty.</p><h4>2.1.1 Recombinant novelty.</h4><p>Recombination has been considered as a source of novelty widely in the literature. The creativity literature contends that linking remote elements is a path to creativity [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]. The management literature suggests that a novel invention results from a synthesis of diversified ideas [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>]. To operationalize this novelty concept, previous measures consider a document to be novel if it includes a new or rare combination of knowledge elements, where a knowledge element is operationalized differently.</p><p>The most straightforward operationalization is to use a word as a knowledge element. For example, Boudreau et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>] measured the novelty of a grant proposal based on a new combination of Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) keywords. Similarly, Zhang et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>] measured the novelty of a scientific paper based on a new combination of keywords that appeared in the abstract. These approaches are intuitive, but the ambiguity of text information (e.g., synonyms) is a concern, which could be sorted out by a controlled vocabulary dictionary.</p><p>The most widely used approach is to consider a cited <em>journal</em> as a knowledge element [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>]. A document is considered novel if it cites documents in two journals that have rarely been cited together. Citation implies that knowledge in a cited document is used by a citing document [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>]. Thus, a document citing a rare journal pair implies that a rare pair of knowledge is integrated. However, since a journal is a highly aggregated unit as a knowledge element, its validity is under dispute despite practical merits [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>].</p><p>The third operationalization is to use a cited <em>reference</em> as a knowledge element instead of a journal. A document is considered novel if it cites a set of documents that have rarely been cited together. Dahlin et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>] proposed an indicator for the novelty of patents based on a rare combination of cited patents. Trapido [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>] applied this approach to scientific documents in the field of electrical engineering, and Matsumoto et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>] further extended it to all fields. These operationalizations draw on citation network analysis to assess the newness of a reference combination.</p><h4>2.1.2 Element novelty.</h4><p>The key limitation of recombinant novelty is that it overlooks the novelty of a knowledge element itself. Radically new ideas often have no discernible antecedent, and fundamental breakthroughs often result from exploring an uncharted knowledge space [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>]. Such isolated incidents of novelty may not be captured by the recombinant novelty measures. In line with this notion, Ahuja et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>] and Trajtenberg et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref038\" class=\"ref-tip\">38</a>] measured the novelty of patents by considering a patent that has no reference to be novel, though this operationalization is not applicable to scientific documents.</p><p>A more generally applicable approach is to draw on the first appearance of a word(s) in a document. If a document includes a certain word or a sequence of words (N-gram) that is new to the world (e.g., the name of a previously unknown chemical compound), it implies that the document delivers novel information. For example, Chen et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>] and Packalen et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>] use the first appearance of n-gram in medical papers to measure the novelty of a scientific documents. Balsmeier et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>] and Arts et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>] also assess the novelty of a patent based on whether it refers to a certain word for the first time. Though this is intuitive, the newness of a word can be misleading as it overlooks synonyms and similar words.</p><p>A solution to this problem is to draw on controlled vocabulary dictionaries. Azoulay et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>] computed the average age of MeSH keywords to evaluate the novelty of an article. Similarly, Strumsky et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>] measured the originality of patents by the appearance of new patent classes. These are nonetheless an imperfect solution as building dictionaries takes substantial expert effort and existing dictionaries are often field-specific.</p><h3>2.2 Word embedding</h3><p>The word embedding technique addresses the limitations in the above-mentioned approaches. Word embedding is a technique to project a word into a high-dimensional vector space. It computes a vector for each word based on the co-occurrences of words in a text corpus [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>]. By inferring the meaning of words from the context surrounding the word, the technique captures semantic relationships from unstructured text data and encodes it in a concise expression. It also reduces noises caused by synonyms and disciplinary jargons. Furthermore, a word embedding model can be extended to multiple languages. Importantly, the process of training word embedding models requires little human intervention or expert knowledge. Though training a model takes computer resources, such trained models can be repeatedly used. Thus, a word embedding model serves as a machine-generated vocabulary dictionary. The word embedding technique is gaining popularity as the performance of machine learning has been improving. In fact, word embeddings have been applied to scientific text for various purposes. For example, Tshitoyan et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>] captured the structure of extant knowledge in material sciences with word embeddings and predicted future discoveries in the field.</p><p>A few studies have used word embeddings to measure novelty. As a word embedding model assigns a vector to each word, one can quantify the distance between any pair of words. By aggregating word vectors at the document level, semantic information included in a document can be expressed as a vector, and thus, the distance between a pair of documents can be computed. This offers the technical basis for measuring novelty. A measure of recombinant novelty based on word embeddings was proposed by Shibayama et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>], in which the distance between cited references and thus the newness of a reference combination is computed. Shibayama et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>] drew on an existing word embedding model in biomedicine (<em>scispaCy</em>), and its applicability to other fields has not been examined. Hain et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>] similarly used the word embedding technique to measure distances between patent documents, and operationalized novelty by the average distance between a focal patent and a set of previous patents. This serves as a measure of element novelty in which a patent document itself is considered as the unit of knowledge element. Unfortunately, the validity of this measure is not examined.</p><p>Some pre-trained word embedding models are publicly accessible, such as <em>scispaCy</em> in biomedicine [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref046\" class=\"ref-tip\">46</a>], <em>mat2vec</em> in materials sciences [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref047\" class=\"ref-tip\">47</a>] and <em>ES2Vec</em> in earth science [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref048\" class=\"ref-tip\">48</a>], but no word embedding trained on field-unspecific scientific vocabularies is publicly available yet. To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first to build a word embedding model for the whole universe of scientific text to measure element novelty and test its validity.</p><h2>3. Developing word embedding model</h2><h3>3.1 Training word embedding model</h3><p>To train a word-embedding model for scientific text, we collected all scientific publications in English in the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) from the Web of Science (WoS) database. The database includes publications from all fields except for social sciences and humanities. We drew on 23 million (23,350,859) records with both titles and abstracts published between 1998 and 2018. We focused on titles and abstracts rather than full text for greater accessibility and for conciseness and efficiency in computation, although full text might provide more detailed and comprehensive information.</p><p>For each publication, we combined the title text and the abstract text and carried out a series of cleaning procedures with the Python library–Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). Specifically, we lowercased the text, removed words consisting purely of numbers and special symbols, and stemmed each word. To further improve the computing efficiency and avoid the noise from trivial or misspelled words, we also removed words that appeared less than five times in the entire database. Using this cleaned text of the 23 million documents, we trained their word embeddings with the <em>word2vec</em> model through Python’s Gensim package (<a href=\"https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/\">https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/</a>). Word2vec reduces the high dimensionality of the word space by training a neural network model while preserving semantic relationships between words. The trained model assigns to each word a \"word embedding\", which is a vector typically in several hundred dimensions. In training our word embedding model, we set default values for most parameters. Among others, we set the vector size as 300 following the original study of <em>word2vec</em> [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>]. Finally, we obtained 300-dimensional word vectors for 3,208,589 unique words. The median number of distinct words in a document is 127.</p><p>To examine the coverage of the words, we compared them with WoS keywords and found that 76% of WoS keywords are included in our model. Thus, a quarter of WoS keywords are not included possibly because they are used only infrequently and thus dropped from our model training.</p><h3>3.2 Validating word distance</h3><p>Before developing the novelty measure, we test whether our word embedding model conveys semantic information of a word. Specifically, we examine whether our model properly represents the distance between words–i.e., related words have similar vectors and unrelated words have remote vectors. For this test, we draw on an extant word embedding model, <em>scispaCy</em> (<em>en_core_sci_lg</em>: <a href=\"https://github.com/allenai/scispacy\">https://github.com/allenai/scispacy</a>). <em>ScispaCy</em> is an established and publicly available word embedding model, offering vector representations of 600,000 vocabularies specializing in biomedical texts [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>]. Shibayama et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>] used <em>scispaCy</em> to develop a measure of recombinant novelty and validated it with survey data, which gives confidence in the performance of the model. Here, we randomly sampled 5,000 words common to <em>scispaCy</em> and to our word embedding model and made all possible pairs of the 5,000 words. For each word pair, we compute 1) the cosine distance based on our word embedding and 2) the cosine distance based on <em>scispaCy</em> word embedding. Finally, we assessed the correlation between the two distance scores, finding a strongly significant correlation (<em>r</em> = .411, p &lt; .001). This suggests that two words that are considered (dis)similar in <em>scispaCy</em> are also considered (dis)similar in our model, supporting the validity of our word embedding model.</p><h3>3.3 Validating document distance</h3><p>Next, we test whether our word embedding model can measure distances between documents by aggregating word vectors. For this analysis, we randomly sampled 1,000 pairs of research articles in five broad disciplines (biology, chemistry, medicine, engineering, and physics) respectively, in which both articles in each pair are published in the focal field in 2018. For each pair, we compute their distance in two approaches–one based on our word embeddings and the other based on a previously established approach–and assess if they are sufficiently correlated.</p><p>We first compute the document distance based on our word embedding model by aggregating the word vectors at the document level. For simplicity, we took the mean of the vectors of all words included in the title and abstract of a focal document. Then, we computed the cosine distance of the vectors of two documents.</p><p>Second, as a previously established approach, we drew on co-citation information of a document pair [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>]. Namely, the distance between a pair of documents <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> is given by:\\n<a name=\"pone.0284567.e001\" id=\"pone.0284567.e001\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0284567.e001\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(1)</span></span>\\nwhere <em>ref</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> is the number of references cited by <em>i</em> and <em>coref</em><sub><em>ij</em></sub> is the number of references cited by both <em>i</em> and <em>j</em>. This is based on the assumption that a pair of documents are similar if they cite a similar set of documents. In sampling document pairs we included only those with at least one co-cited reference. If we had sampled document pairs completely randomly, it would be highly unlikely that they share any reference. Since the co-citation distance is not a perfect measure of document distance, we expect only a modest correlation between the two distance scores. We did find a significant correlation (<em>r</em> = .22, p &lt; .001), suggesting that our word embedding model conveys semantic information at the document level.</p><h4>3.3.1 Field difference.</h4><p>It is plausible that the validity of the word embedding model differs across scientific fields due to potential differences in the nature of knowledge. We thus split the sample into five fields and found some differences in the magnitude of correlations (<a href=\"#pone-0284567-g001\">Fig 1</a>). Relatively higher correlations are found in physics (<em>r</em> = .23) and engineering (<em>r</em> = .22) while lower correlations are found in chemistry (<em>r</em> = .089) and biology (<em>r</em> = .084) (light bars).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec3.sec1.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec3.sec1.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>Pearson’s correlation coefficient with the co-citation distance.

That is, our training data include more publications in some fields (e.g., medicine) and less in other fields, which may affect the performance of the word embedding model. To investigate this possibility, we also trained five sets of word embedding models with text data only in a certain field. We then replicate the correlation analysis in each field by computing document distance based on the word embedding trained with the text data in the focal field (dark bars). In fact, the correlation coefficients become larger with the field-specific model in all fields except for medicine. This suggests that the performance of the word embedding technique may be improved by limiting the scope of knowledge areas.</p><h4>3.3.2 Time difference.</h4><p>In the main analysis, the training data for modelling the word embedding include publications up to 2018, and the test data are publications in 2018. We then investigated how the temporal gap between training data and test data influences the measurement of documents’ distance (<a href=\"#pone-0284567-g002\">Fig 2</a>). First, we applied our model to older documents (light bars). Namely, we sampled 3,000 document pairs in three 3-year time windows (2010–12, 2013–15, and 2016–18) and replicated the correlation analysis. If the evolution of knowledge is fast, distances between older documents can be measured less effectively. To the contrary, if the knowledge structure is stable over time, distances between older documents can be measured more precisely because words in older documents have a longer history of use and thus the model is better trained. The result showed greater correlation coefficients in the 2010–12 window than in the 2016–18 window, which appears consistent with the latter argument. Next, to investigate whether the word embedding model can be applied for future documents, we developed another word embedding model with training data up to 2010. Then, we apply this model to the same three windows of document pairs (dark bars). The result shows lower correlation coefficients in more recent years, probably because words in more recent documents are less likely to be included in the training data.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec3.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec3.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>Pearson’s correlation coefficient with the co-citation distance.

Measuring novelty</h2><h3>4.1 Operationalization</h3><p>Based on the word embedding, we computed a series of element novelty measures in the following steps. First, we assigned a vector to each document by taking the mean of the word vectors of all words included in the title and abstract text of the document. The document vector of document <em>i</em> is given by\\n<a name=\"pone.0284567.e002\" id=\"pone.0284567.e002\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0284567.e002\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(2)</span></span>\\nwhere <em>v</em><sub><em>ik</em></sub>∈ℝ<sup>300</sup> is a word vector of the <em>k</em>-th word and <em>w</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> is the number of words included in document <em>i</em>.</p><p>Second, for each focal document <em>i</em>, we computed its distance from all other documents published before document <em>i</em>. Suppose that document <em>i</em> has <em>N</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> documents previously published. For each of the <em>N</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> documents, denoted by <em>j</em>∈{1,…,<em>N</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>}, we computed the cosine distance given by:\\n<a name=\"pone.0284567.e003\" id=\"pone.0284567.e003\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0284567.e003\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(3)</span></span></p><p>The cosine distance ranges from 0 to 2 with a larger value indicating a larger distance.</p><p>Finally, we computed the element novelty of each document. We sort all distance scores <em>d</em><sub><em>ij</em></sub> and use the <em>q</em>-percentile values as novelty scores (<em>ElementNovel</em><sub><em>q</em></sub>), where the 100-percentile is the maximum and the 0-percentile is the minimum. The intuition is that a document is considered novel if it is distant from other documents. Even if the minimum distance is still high, it indicates that the document is distant from all other documents. Therefore, low percentile values are of our particular interest. We computed a series of scores (<em>q</em>∈[0,100]) but mainly use the lower-percentile scores (<em>q</em> = 0, 1, 5, 10, …).</p><h3>4.2 Questionnaire survey for validation</h3><p>To test the validity of the proposed novelty measure, we conducted a questionnaire survey and draw on self-reported novelty scores. We sampled the respondents in the following steps. First, we identified contact authors whose email addresses are available in WoS publication records. We then selected contact authors who had published at least four English-written papers (\"article\", \"letter\", or \"proceedings paper\"). This is to ensure that the authors have sufficient research experience and can reasonably assess novelty. For each author, we selected one paper that was most recently published (as of 2018). To avoid recall bias we dropped authors whose latest paper was published in 2015 or before. Finally, we randomly sampled 10,357 author-paper pairs. After three waves requests, 1,020 were bounced back and 825 responses were collected (response rate = 8.8%). The scientific fields of the papers are biology (28%), chemistry (28%), medicine (13%), engineering (13%), physics (14%), and other fields (5%). We found no significant response bias in terms of scientific fields.</p><p>The survey inquired into various qualities of scientific papers, of which this study draws on one section including three items concerning scientific novelty. We developed the questionnaire items partly informed by previous surveys on scientific novelty [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>] and tested them with a small-scale pilot survey. The items assess how the respondent’s selected paper make contribution in three aspects: A) in creating/developing something (e.g., methods, materials, data, chemicals), B) in discovering/identifying something (e.g., phenomena, substances, molecules), and C) in understanding/explaining something (e.g., mechanisms, theories). Each aspect is assessed on a 3-point scale–\"not applicable\" (previously reported or irrelevant), \"improved\" (improvement over previously reported findings), and \"novel\" (not previously reported) (<a href=\"#pone-0284567-g003\">Fig 3</a>). For the following validation we mainly use three dummy variables (<em>Novel</em><sub><em>A</em></sub>, <em>Novel</em><sub><em>B</em></sub> and, <em>Novel</em><sub><em>C</em></sub>), each assigned 1 if the response is \"novel\" and 0 otherwise. We also use 3-point ordinal variables <a href=\"#pone.0284567.s001\">S1 Fig</a>.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0284567.g003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0284567.g003</a></p><h3>4.3 Validating novelty measures</h3><p><a href=\"#pone-0284567-g004\">Fig 4</a> illustrates the histograms of element novelty measures (<em>q</em> = 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50) for the survey respondents’ papers. All measures are well distributed though somewhat right-skewed.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec4.sec3.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec4.sec3.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>The histogram of element novelty measures with various <em>q</em>’s (A: 0, B: 1, C: 5, D: 10, E: 20, and F: 50).</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0284567.g004\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0284567.g004</a></p><p><a href=\"#pone-0284567-g005\">Fig 5</a> plots the correlation coefficients between element novelty measures and the survey novelty scores in three aspects. Although it presents the whole range (<em>q =</em> [0,100]) of element novelty measures, element novelty in lower <em>q</em> values is of our interest. The result indicates significant correlation between our element novelty measure and <em>Novel</em><sub><em>B</em></sub> survey score (\"discovering and identifying\"). This is consistent with our expectation in that \"discovery\" and \"identification\" (e.g., phenomena, substances, molecules) tend to be represented by a word or relatively short expressions–i.e., literally elemental. In contrast, correlations with <em>Novel</em><sub><em>C</em></sub> (\"understanding and explaining\") are largely insignificant. This is also understandable in that \"understanding\" and \"explanation\" (e.g., mechanisms, theories) are likely to be composite knowledge and less easy to capture in an isolated element. Interestingly, correlations with <em>Novel</em><sub><em>A</em></sub> (\"creating and developing methods, materials, data, chemicals\") are negatively significant, though rather modestly.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec4.sec3.fig2.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec4.sec3.fig2.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>N = 754. *p&lt;0.05. **p&lt;0.01.***p&lt;0.001.</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0284567.g005\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0284567.g005</a></p><p>As the nature of novelty may differ across fields [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref049\" class=\"ref-tip\">49</a>], we split this correlation analysis into five fields (<a href=\"#pone-0284567-g006\">Fig 6</a>), finding somewhat different patterns between fields. First, the significant correlation with <em>Novel</em><sub><em>B</em></sub> (\"discovering and identifying\") is stable in all fields except engineering. <a href=\"#pone.0284567.s001\">S1 Fig</a>, nonetheless, shows modest correlations between <em>Novel</em><sub><em>B</em></sub> and 3-point survey scores of novelty in engineering. Thus, our novelty measure seems to be associated with elemental advancement in all fields. Second, <em>Novel</em><sub><em>C</em></sub> (\"understanding and explaining\") is largely insignificant except in medicine. This may imply that new mechanisms and theories in medicine tend to be expressed in simpler terms. Third, <em>Novel</em><sub><em>A</em></sub> (\"creating and developing\") is found significantly negatively correlated in engineering and physics. This implies that new methods and materials in these fields tend to be closely related to existing knowledge.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec4.sec3.fig3.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec4.sec3.fig3.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>A series of element novelty scores (<em>q</em> = 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20) are displayed. <sup>†</sup>p&lt;0.1. *p&lt;0.05. **p&lt;0.01.***p&lt;0.001.</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0284567.g006\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0284567.g006</a></p><p>This field difference may be partly attributed to the difference in the performance of our word embedding model (<a href=\"#pone-0284567-g001\">Fig 1</a>). Thus, we replicated the correlation analysis by using field-specific word embedding models (<a href=\"#pone-0284567-g007\">Fig 7</a>). For easier comparison we used a 10-percentile value (<em>q</em> = 10) among the novelty measure series (<em>ElementNovel</em><sub><em>10</em></sub>). <a href=\"#pone-0284567-g007\">Fig 7A</a> is based on the word embedding trained by the full publication data (10-percentile values extracted from <a href=\"#pone-0284567-g006\">Fig 6</a>), whereas <a href=\"#pone-0284567-g007\">Fig 7B</a> is based on the word embedding trained by the text only in the focal field. The difference between the two panels (A and B) is rather subtle. We observed largely similar patterns for <em>Novel</em><sub><em>A</em></sub> (\"creating and developing\") and <em>Novel</em><sub><em>C</em></sub> (\"understanding and explaining\"). The correlation with <em>Novel</em><sub><em>B</em></sub> (\"discovering and identifying\") turns insignificant in medicine and physics, suggesting that the full model serves better to detect this novelty aspect. Thus, even though field-specific word embedding models may perform better in measuring document distances (<a href=\"#pone-0284567-g001\">Fig 1</a>), we do not have a strong reason to use field-specific models in measuring novelty, especially when the boundary between scientific fields is becoming ambiguous [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec4.sec3.fig4.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec4.sec3.fig4.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>(A) Full model.

The first is an element novelty measure based on new words [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>]. We assessed whether a scientific document contains any word that appears for the first time with the WoS publishing date. Many words first appeared in the early years of our dataset (1998–2018). To avoid detecting such spurious novelty, we set a baseline pool of words that appeared in the first five years (1998–2002). After excluding words in the baseline pool, we identified 1.4 million unique new words in 1.2 million documents published after 2003. We prepared a dummy variable coded 1 if a document contains at least one new word and 0 otherwise (<em>NewWord</em>).</p><p>The second is a recombinant novelty measure computed with the word embedding technique [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. Their measure is based on the distance between cited references of a focal paper. Shibayama et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>] used an existing word embedding (<em>scispaCy</em>) to compute document vectors of all references, computed the cosine distance for all pairs of references, and took the maximum distance as the novelty measure. We employed this procedure with our word embedding model (<em>RecombNovel</em>).</p><p><a href=\"#pone-0284567-g008\">Fig 8</a> presents the correlations between the existing novelty measures and the survey scores in all fields as well as in respective fields. Regarding the new-word element novelty, the correlations are rather small and insignificant overall (<a href=\"#pone-0284567-g008\">Fig 8A</a>). Still, compared with our element novelty (<a href=\"#pone-0284567-g007\">Fig 7A</a>), somewhat larger correlations are found for <em>Novel</em><sub><em>A</em></sub> (\"creating and developing\") in chemistry, <em>Novel</em><sub><em>B</em></sub> (\"discovering and identifying\") in engineering, and <em>Novel</em><sub><em>C</em></sub> (\"understanding and explaining\") in biology and physics. As to the recombinant novelty measure, the correlation with <em>Novel</em><sub><em>B</em></sub> (\"discovering and identifying\") turns rather modest except in medicine, and the correlation with <em>Novel</em><sub><em>A</em></sub> (\"creating and developing\") becomes stronger, though still modest, in chemistry, medicine, and engineering (<a href=\"#pone-0284567-g008\">Fig 8B</a>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec4.sec4.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec4.sec4.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>(A) <em>NewWord</em>.

Discussion</h2><p>As novelty is a core value in science [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>] and technological progress [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>], several bibliometric measures for novelty have been proposed [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. Nonetheless, a few fundamental limitations remain, which this study aims to address by offering a validated and field-universal approach to compute element novelty.</p><p>To this end, we first developed a word embedding model based on large-scale scientific text data. The word embedding technique draws on machine learning to extract semantic information from text data as high-dimensional vectors assigned to every word. We confirmed that word distances measured by our model are largely consistent with an established but field-specific word embedding model (<em>scispaCy</em>). We also found that document distances measured by our model are consistent with co-citation distances. Overall, these results give confidence to the performance of our word embedding model. A breakdown by scientific fields suggests that the performance of word embedding models varies across fields, and using a field-specific word embedding model may be suitable depending on the purpose.</p><p>Second, using the developed word embedding model, we computed element novelty measures. The validation with our survey scores suggests that the proposed novelty measure is strongly correlated with <em>Novel</em><sub><em>B</em></sub> (\"discovering and identifying\") across most scientific fields. This is consistent with our expectation in that discovering and identifying phenomena, substances, molecules tend to be represented by a new word or short expressions. We also computed element novelty with field-specific word embedding models without finding substantial improvement. Finally, compared with previous novelty measures, our element novelty measure is more strongly and stably correlated at least with <em>Novel</em><sub><em>B</em></sub>. Therefore, our element novelty measure based on our own word embedding model seems to provide a strong approach to quantify element novelty in terms of discovering or identifying something new.</p><p>This study offers a few contributions. First, we provide a robust and versatile measure of element novelty. Despite its fundamental importance [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>], element novelty has been underserved in comparison to recombinant novelty [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]. Our approach based on word embeddings is robust and efficient in comparison to existing measures of element novelty based on keywords [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>]. Further, our approach is applicable irrespective of scientific fields. Some of the existing novelty measures are applicable only in certain fields [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>], which is a critical flaw given increasing interdisciplinarity [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>].</p><p>Second, this study offers self-reported novelty data from multiple angles, with which previous and future bibliometric novelty measures can be tested. Previous novelty measures were often not validated. As novelty is a multifaceted concept [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>], it has been unclear what aspect of novelty is captured by previous measures. Our validation analyses clarify the novelty dimension that our measure captures as well as its differences from other bibliometric measures.</p><p>Third, this study presents a field-universal and validated word embedding model. It offers a technical basis to interpret scientific text information, which can be applied not only for calculating novelty of scientific articles but also for broader purposes. For example, the novelty score can be computed for any text information (e.g., funding applications). We can apply the word embedding to a collection of knowledge (e.g., research portfolio of individuals, organizations, etc.) and measure its qualities such as diversity. We can also apply it to text data over a certain time period and investigate the temporal evolution of knowledge.</p><p>This study nonetheless has a few limitations. First, we examined our word embedding model and the novelty measure in all fields except for social sciences and humanities. When science is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary, establishing a methodology applicable in these fields as well would be beneficial. Second, we need to further explore what aspect of novelty is captured by the novelty measure. Particularly, the validation analysis in different fields presents mixed results, and the interpretation is not always straightforward. Third, differences between various novelty indicators need further investigation. For example, we expected that our element novelty measure corresponds to <em>Novel</em><sub><em>B</em></sub> whereas previous recombinant novelty measures capture better new composite knowledge (<em>Novel</em><sub><em>A</em></sub> and <em>Novel</em><sub><em>C</em></sub>), but the result is not perfectly clear.</p><h2>6. Conclusions</h2><p>This study offers a new bibliometric indicator of element novelty, drawing on a word embedding model trained on scientific publications in all disciplines, and validated it with self-reported novelty scores from our original survey. To further advance the methodology, a few directions of exploration are possible. First, the word embedding model can be further improved. Our main goal was to provide a validated and scalable method to measure element novelty, and we did not aim to optimize its performance once the validation analysis demonstrated satisfactory results. Nonetheless, the word embedding model can be improved with more advanced techniques such as Sentence-BERT or SciBERT [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref050\" class=\"ref-tip\">50</a>]. Also, the parameter setting of the machine learning can be fine-tuned, while we mostly followed the default setup. Further, we could expand the scope of the word embedding including documents from social sciences and humanities. Second, we can further explore correspondence between different aspects of novelty and various novelty indicators including ours. Our measure does not seem to capture a few aspects of novelty (<em>Novel</em><sub><em>A</em></sub> and <em>Novel</em><sub><em>C</em></sub>). While this is desirable in that our measure has specificity, we need alternatives to measure these aspects. Recombinant novelty measures may serve the purpose, and future analyses should examine what novelty aspects are captured by various recombinant novelty operationalizations [<a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0284567.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]. We can also examine the correspondence in respective fields more thoroughly with larger validation data.</p><h2>Supporting information</h2><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0284567.s001\">S1 Fig. </a>Correlation between element novelty scores and survey scores.</h3><p class=\"preSiDOI\">A series of element novelty scores (<em>q</em> = 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20) are displayed. <sup>†</sup>p&lt;0.1. *p&lt;0.05. **p&lt;0.01.***p&lt;0.001.

The world’s energy resources, especially non-renewable sources, are vanishing by leaps and bounds. However, agencies like the Paris Climate Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable development have defined some preventive measures to consider while consuming energy. The main issue in Pakistan is that the consumer is not supplied with electric power in a managed way, and the way of installation causes a lot of impairment to the expensive tools in the power distribution system. The motivation of this research focuses on energy management, making the distribution authority more powerful, digitalization, and protection of expensive components in electrical power systems. The proposed methodology uses current and voltage sensors to remotely monitor the amount of power being supplied to the consumer continuously, along with a microcontroller responsible for activating the relay in case of over-consumption and the Global System for Mobile (GSM) network to warn the consumer and inform the authority. This research work prevents manual and laborious meter readings and protects electrical instruments. Further, this work can enable online billing, pre-paid billing, and energy saving and provide a base for power theft detection.</p><p><strong>Citation: </strong>Shah MH, Khan S, Khan A, Khan I, Eldin SM (2023) Sustainable energy management using the Internet of Things (IoT).

Countries must fully utilize their available natural resources to reduce the consumption of resources and costs of electricity as much as possible [<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. Mostly, the electric energy of the entire world is generated in power plants by burning fossil fuels, which are non-renewable resources and produce adverse impacts on the environment [<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>]. Recent researches recommend that if fossil fuel consumption rates stay uniform and constant, the world reserve for fossil fuels will hardly last for 55–65 years [<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. Furthermore, the Paris Climate Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development have set goals to minimize environmental emissions [<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. If the power shortage crises remain imminent, modern civilization will be paralyzed. The tip of society will collapse.</p><p>Also, in Pakistan, without proper energy and load management, excessive fuel sources can be easily observed [<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. Another issue in Pakistan is that the main service lines are connected directly to the consumers’ meters without any protective measures, which causes severe losses and damages [<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. It threatens the most expensive elements in electric power distribution, such as transformers [<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. A power transformer, is shown in <a href=\"#pone-0283754-g001\">Fig 1</a> is considered the backbone and most critical equipment in electrical power conversion, so it requires better stability and reliable protection [<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0283754.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0283754.g001</a></p><p>In Pakistan, only eight power-providing companies had damaged many power transformers. It results in a loss of almost 1.5 billion Pakistani Rupees. The <a href=\"#pone-0283754-t001\">Table 1</a> shows the number of transformers damaged in three months this year in those companies [<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0283754.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0283754.t001</a></p><p>Unfortunately, every year in Pakistan shortage of electricity and no power availability is caused by the destruction of transformers as a result of overloading given in <a href=\"#pone-0283754-g002\">Fig 2</a>, as well as creating a financial load on the treasure of the government, and no preventive measures are taken to prevent the loss [<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. It is impossible to achieve an immune electrical distribution system using the traditional manual operating and managing system [<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. Also, consumers in this modern world demand more cost-effective and reliable energy [<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0283754.g002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0283754.g002</a></p><p>Furthermore, Pakistan has two types of energy meters: single-phase and three-phase energy meters [<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. In a single-phase energy meter, the consumer can use a maximum power of up to 5KW at a time. Similarly, in three phase energy meter, 15KW power is allowed to be used at a time [<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. A 100KVA transformer is set up for 20 single-phase energy meters [<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]. There is no absolute check on the consumer’s side to prevent excessive overloading, but when one of the consumers tends to exceed the threshold, the transformer is blown out [<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>] as shown in the <a href=\"#pone-0283754-g003\">Fig 3</a>.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0283754.g003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0283754.g003</a></p><p>So, the proposed energy meter is designed for fixed power provision and can be easily graded according to the customer’s demand. The consumer would be supposed to pay only by the power consumed. Everyone will be able to apply to the authority for its respective demands. The most significant feature of this energy meter is that no one can overload it. If any consumer dares to overload it, the energy meter will be tripped, generating two messages with the help of a GSM module: one to the consumer as a warning and the other to the regulatory authority for notification [<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]. In such a way, the distribution transformer is protected, which is the core objective of this study. This research work aims to provide efficient and continuous readings from sensors to avoid billing errors and reduce maintenance costs. Empowering the authority to provide specific power, along with notification with the help of the GSM network to consumers as they try to drag more power. The main contribution of this proposed research is to protect the expensive elements like transformer from consumer’s side, while considering sustainability and not using chemicals, gases, or oil on transformer’s side.</p><p>In short, this methodology will help:</p><h2>Related work</h2><p>With the invention of electricity, it was felt necessary to measure the amount of power consumed by an entity [<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. An instrument, an energy meter, was required to do the job. The energy meter from then to now undergoes four generations: the first generation includes induction-type meters, also called mechanical meters. The second generation comprises electro-mechanical meters <a href=\"#pone-0283754-g004\">Fig 4</a>, the third generation contains electronic meters, also known as static meters shown in <a href=\"#pone-0283754-g005\">Fig 5</a>, and the fourth generation is the current smart meters [<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0283754.g004\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0283754.g004</a></p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0283754.g005\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0283754.g005</a></p><p>Energy meters are made smarter for many purposes. Theodore Paraskevakos stood first in introducing The Automated Meter Reading (AMR) system while using advanced technology composed of wiring and wireless tools such as cable networks, power lines, RF modules, GSM modules and LCD for display purposes. M.V. Shinde and P.W. Kulkarni developed energy meter reading system using ZigBee and GSM architecture [<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>]. Y. B Mandak <em>et al</em>. developed an Automated Energy Meter that could monitor and control the reading remotely, but the energy measurement remained laborious and tiresome [<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>].</p><p>Md.

Their results show 74% efficiency [<a href=\"#pone.0283754.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>]. Himshekhar Das and L.C. Saika proposed the same methodology with the integration of Virtual Instrumentation that can be operated in any computer for functioning as In-Home Display (IHD) for an Energy Management System (EMS).

But energy management is not catered to properly in terms of the usage of the Internet of Things (IOT), nor the consumer satisfaction ever considered, and the protection of the transformer from the consumer side is also not addressed. Therefore, this research aims to fill these gaps using Smart Energy Meter (SEM).</p><h2>Materials and methods</h2><p>The proposed methodology as shown in the <a href=\"#pone-0283754-g006\">Fig 6</a> comprises an energy meter, current and voltage sensors, an Arduino microcontroller, a GSM module, a Relay module, and an LCD for display. When the lines of the energy meter are energized, the current and voltage sensors read their value continuously to calculate the amount of power flow, as power is the product of both current flow and voltage applied. The Arduino microcontroller reads the values from the sensors and displays these values on LCD. The Arduino Microcontroller is the main element responsible for comparing the amount of power flow with the preset conditions. The GSM and Relay modules are connected to the Arduino microcontroller for actuation.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0283754.g006\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0283754.g006</a></p><p>Whenever a customer tries to drive more power than the authority’s allotted amount, the current and voltage sensors will input the data to the Arduino microcontroller. The microcontroller will compare these. If the dragged power is more, the microcontroller will trip the energy meter by actuating the Relay module and generating two text messages with the GSM module’s help, as shown in <a href=\"#pone-0283754-g007\">Fig 7</a>. One message, “Dear Customer, you have overloaded the transformer. Therefore, your meter is tripped off” will be sent to the customer. The other message, “The meter no…. is tripped off due to overloading the transformer” will be sent to the authority. As all customers do not need the same amount of power, they are all provided only with 5KW and 15KW power in Pakistan. Here, the factor of energy management is introduced so that any customer can be provided with the desired amount of power, which will be considered the preset condition, and the customer is to be charged accordingly. So, the proposed energy meter can be graded based on customers’ demands.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0283754.g007\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0283754.g007</a></p><h3>Software simulation</h3><p>The simulation is carried out with the help of Proteus Simulating Software using version 8 professional, as shown in <a href=\"#pone-0283754-g008\">Fig 8</a>. Simulation in Proteus is very efficient and gives almost 100% realistic imitation of the work done physically.

In addition, the developed system provides remote supply connectivity, disconnectivity, and configuration capability in contrast to the existing smart meter. Furthermore, the developed system provides a cost-efficient solution to the consumer by 61%. The conventional mindset is one of the major hindrances in adopting the concept. Still, the lesser cost associated with the developed system makes it an ideal solution for the consumer.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The central aim is to provide a consumer-friendly electric energy measuring system with the least human fatigue and labour, with the help of implementing modern techniques and technology which is even integrable with the traditional system. Different sensors measure the amount of power consumed by an entity. If the power dragged more than the prescribed amount, the Arduino microcontroller is there to cut off the main line of the consumer by actuating the 2-Relay module. This system also employs the GSM module to keep bidirectional communication strong between customers and authorities. The authority is made powerful as this device helps it get notified in case of unwanted situations. Furthermore, energy management is also being practised as this system can be graded, and the desired amount of power can be allotted to a customer. The proposed system provides an energy-friendly and sustainable environment within the community and can be helpful to keep Pakistan standing among the row of electrically-smart nations.</p><h2>Future work</h2><p>The proposed system can be customized for further objectives like;</p><p>This can be beneficial enough for the industries to eliminate the penalties due to the low power factor.</p><h2>References</h2><h3>Subject Areas <div id=\"subjInfo\">?</div>\\n    <div id=\"subjInfoText\">\\n      <p>For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/PLOS/plos-thesaurus/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link opens in new window\">here</a>.</p>\\n      <span class=\"inline-intro\">We want your feedback.</span> Do these Subject Areas make sense for this article?

It considers financial inclusion as a dependent variable. It describes ATMs and the number of commercial banks’ depositors as proxy variables. In contrast, financial inclusion is considered an independent variable. We used the ratio between broad and narrow money to describe it. We employ several statistical tests such as lm, Pesaran, and shin W-stat, a- tests for cross-section dependence, and unit root and panel granger causality with NARDL and system GMM approaches. The empirical results reveal the significant nexus between these two variables. The outcomes suggest that adaptation and diffusion of financial innovation play catalyst roles in bringing unbanked people into the financial network. In comparison, the inflows of FDI establish mixed positive and negative effects, which vary with model estimation following different econometrical tools. It is also revealed that FDI inflow can augment the financial inclusion process, and trade openness can play a directive role and enhance the financial inclusion process. These findings suggest that financial innovation, trade openness, and institutional quality should continue in the selected countries to enhance financial inclusion and promote capital formation in the selected countries.</p><p><strong>Citation: </strong>Qamruzzaman M (2023) Does financial innovation foster financial inclusion in Arab world? examining the nexus between financial innovation, FDI, remittances, trade openness, and gross capital formation.

Introduction</h2><p>Saving money and financial resources for future use is a natural habit. Households choose to forego some current consumption and save money for increased spending in the future regardless of their social or spiritual identity and character. Typically, the saved money was stashed in one’s property, such as an attic, under the ground, and in a mattress or cushion. With the advent of the modern banking and finance system, households started depositing surplus funds into banks, initially for the safe custody of their money. Then banks started offering them retunes on their savings under various schemes. Some households and firms prefer keeping their savings or surplus money in cash. However, most individuals and institutions prefer to use banks to convert their idle surplus money into investments through banks and financial bodies [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. In this way, banks serve as an intermediary between those who want to invest and those who want to be invested. Thus, banks facilitate the smooth functioning of the economy’s financial sector. Recently, with the advent of technologies and the inclusion of scientific knowledge in banking, the financial industry underwent a transformation phase and entered into a new era of development. With this innovative emergence of digital and wireless technologies, the banking industry has transformed from the traditional style of banking, where the customer’s physical appearance was a must for the banking transaction, to an innovative banking style where financial technology and innovation give birth to branchless banking [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>]. An individual can either walk into a bank for his banking transactions or go online and do the same with convenience in terms of time and costs. This innovation and emerging branchless or online banking trend are changing how payments, savings, borrowing, and investment services are, regardless of the developing and developed world.</p><p>With the emerging demands of individuals and business firms and the development in technology and innovation, banking has become sturdier than in the past. Nowadays, the query may be raised about whether the banks will shy away from bringing everyone into the financial system. That might result in low per capita economic performance, a decline in lending and investments, and a drop in employment. For achieving the macroeconomic objectives and goals, the significance of the financial sector as a prime stimulant is well understood, realized, and documented; plenty of scholarly work shows a close link between financial inclusion (hereafter FI) and financial innovation (hereafter FIN). Consequently, financial inclusion has gotten the attention of scholars, authorities, institutions, international organizations, and social activists. It has become an essential agenda in the development programs and policies of governments and international institutions, including the UN. Given the limits of previous research, this work aims to close the gap by incorporating a few proxy measures to quantify financial inclusion (FI) and Financial Innovation (FIN.) We incorporated a few macroeconomic indicators as control variables to boost the estimation’s robustness.</p><p>The present study considered financial innovation and FDI inflows in the financial inclusion equation in Arab nations. Financial innovation has become increasingly important in achieving financial inclusion globally. It has enabled millions of people to access financial services, such as loans and savings, that they may have otherwise been excluded from due to a lack of resources. Financial innovation helps to foster financial inclusion by providing access to financial services to members of society and individuals who previously lacked such access [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>]. Financial innovation provides different types of services that can be tailored and adapted to the needs of different individuals, including those who were previously unable to access financial institutions or services. Through technology, new financial products that are more affordable or have lower entry requirements than traditional financial products can be created. That allows individuals who would otherwise not have access to such services due to limited income, lack of financial education, or other barriers to gain access to these services, enabling them to manage their finances better and build their assets [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. Additionally, financial innovation can help reduce the cost of financial services, allowing more people to access such services. Financial inclusion is increased by providing access to more people, allowing individuals and businesses to obtain the capital they need to achieve their economic goals.</p><p>Foreign direct investment can help promote financial inclusion by improving access to capital, technology, and markets for small businesses, particularly in developing countries. By providing much-needed capital and resources to entrepreneurs and small businesses, FDI can help increase access to financial services and products, such as bank accounts and credit cards, boosting the overall financial inclusion rate. FDI also brings technological advances that can increase the speed and efficiency of financial services. Additionally, access to new markets created through FDI can help stimulate economic growth, creating new opportunities for entrepreneurs and small business owners. All of these effects have the potential to enhance overall financial inclusion levels.</p><p>As a case study, the present study has considered Arab nations in a panel data investigation. One of the most significant objectives of financial inclusion is to decrease poverty and foster economic growth in emerging nations. Through expanding access to financial services, individuals in these nations can establish companies, purchase houses, and send their children to school. Notwithstanding the advantages of financial inclusion, there are currently 1,7 billion people without bank accounts worldwide. In addition, many individuals in underdeveloped nations continue to depend on informal financial services such as payday lenders and pawn shops. This is often because official financial institutions are either too far away or too costly for them to utilize. Technology can help bridge the divide between individuals with and without access to financial services. In Kenya, for instance, mobile money services such as M-Pesa enable individuals to send and receive money without a bank account [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. Moreover, mobile devices may be used to access banking services, make payments, and transfer funds. Financial inclusion is a crucial strategy for supporting economic growth in underdeveloped nations. Expanding access to financial services can help alleviate poverty and expand opportunities for everyone [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>].</p><p>The motivation of the study is to gauge the effect of financial innovation, FDI, remittances, trade openness, and gross capital formation as a determinant of financial inclusion in Arab nations by employing the robust panel date estimation.</p><p>To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first research in the Arab World to use the variables mentioned above for Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lagged (NARDL) and system GMM modeling in the Arab context. In doing so, we hope to add to the extant literature on this crucial topic and uncover relevant findings for developing long-term policies for inflows of FDI in Arab countries. In Arab countries, we look at possible nonlinear interactions between FI, FIN, Economic growth (Y), Gross Capital Formation (GCF), foreign direct investment (FDI), Tide openness (TO), and personal remittances (PR). The previous literature on Arab countries focuses on FIN’s critical role in FI. As a result, the current research examines the long-term correlations between several variables in Arab economies.</p><p>The current work focuses on FIN as a critical indicator for understanding FI. It considers the possibility of nonlinear interactions between FI and FIN, previously overlooked in paned data analysis. This study is the first to investigate the nonlinear interactions between these variables in Arab economies. The present work examines the connection between technology and the financial sector to study the effects of technology on FI and FDI for the 22 selected Arab countries. The study uses the data from 2004 to 2020, employs panel data analysis, and considers FI as dependent variables, the ratio between broad money and small money, and ATMs and the number of depositors with commercial banks as proxy variables to describe it. We employ several statistical tests. The data and methodology section gives precise details of these tests and techniques. It is found that there are only a few analytical studies on the Arab countries from financial innovation and FI perspectives. Therefore, there is a dire need to fill this gap by conducting a thorough empirical investigation. The present study considers financial innovation a key indicator for explicating FI and incorporating the possible nonlinear relationships between FI and FNI. The present study attempts to meet this need and to add a constructive addition to the existing literature on government expenditure and trade balance.</p><p>This study’s formation is as follows: Section 2 briefly analyzes the existing studies related to the topic. Our research approach, model specification, and data are presented in section 3. The following section summarizes the empirical findings, analysis, and interpretations. Moreover, the summary of the main findings and conclusion of the study, followed by suggestions, is provided in the last section.</p><h2>2. Literature review</h2><p>To begin, we will examine the evidence regarding financial inclusion. The current research concentrates on the linkage between Financial Inclusion and Innovation, primarily mediated by FDI inflows. The current purported work is summarized into three categories for coherence.</p><h3>2.1. Studies on financial inclusion</h3><p>Financial innovation is a concept that involves the introduction of new products, services, or processes in the financial sector. It has been designed to improve access to financial services by providing more inclusive and cost-effective products suited to the needs of low-income and underserved populations. Financial innovation has enabled financial institutions to increase the reach of their services and provide greater access to financial inclusion for those traditionally excluded from the banking system. Financial innovation has also helped to reduce transaction costs, reduce risks associated with accessing finance, and make financial products more accessible to vulnerable communities, ultimately improving access to opportunities for individuals, households, and businesses that may otherwise have been excluded from the financial sector [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>]. As a result, financial innovation has become an essential tool in the drive to promote global financial inclusion. Financial innovations have contributed significantly towards expediting financial inclusion, allowing more people access to banking and credit services, even in remote areas with limited infrastructure. For instance, mobile banking technology, such as mobile payments, has allowed more people to bank without having to visit an ATM or a bank branch physically. Additionally, financial inclusion is supported by technological advancements such as blockchain and digital ledgers, enabling financial institutions to facilitate financial services to those previously excluded due to financial or geographic constraints. This has created unprecedented financial inclusion, providing access to financial services to those previously unable to access them. In conclusion, financial innovations have revolutionized financial inclusion and enabled financial institutions to provide services that were not previously available [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>].</p><p>Financial innovation is essential in increasing people’s access to financial services and enabling them to manage their finances better. The increased accessibility of banking services has enabled more people to become financially included by being able to open bank accounts, transfer money safely and securely, access credit and manage their finances better. As a result, financial inclusion has increased sharply in recent years due to the availability of these innovative solutions. Moreover, financial innovation has significantly impacted the availability and accessibility of financial services for individuals and businesses in the developing world [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>]. This increased accessibility of banking services has enabled more people to become financially included by being able to open bank accounts, transfer money safely and securely, access credit and manage their finances better. As a result, financial inclusion has increased sharply in recent years due to the availability of these innovative solutions.</p><p>Numerous types of research have revealed that FI has anti-poverty significance, enables capital mobility, raises savings, advances financial stability, and drives long-term economic prosperity [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]. Similarly, [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>] unearths that financial inclusion has an important influence on restructuring and alleviating poverty in emerging countries. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>] pooled data from the International Monetary Fund’s Financial Access Survey and two distinct techniques to create a multifaceted financial inclusion scale for a broad cohort of 95 nations from 2004 to 2015. The findings report that financial inclusion has generally enhanced over the research period. The study revealed that financial inclusion seems to be linked to GDP per capita, jobs, bank competitiveness, intellectual progress, regulatory quality, and internet activity significantly. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>] disclose that increasing SME financial inclusion boosts growth and employment in the Middle East and Central Asia (MENAP and CCA) regions. Thereby shall garner efficiency of fiscal and monetary policies and aid in financial stability in the region. The study estimated that annual economic growth might be improved by up to 1% in some circumstances, driving up to 16 million new jobs in these purported regions by 2025. Kim, Yu &amp; Hassan (2018) investigate the connection between financial inclusion and economic growth in OIC economies. Based on the panel Granger causality tests, it is revealed that financial inclusion has a favorable impact on OIC countries’ economic growth. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>] demonstrate that financial inclusion improves business sales growth using 55,596 firms’ data from developing and emerging countries. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>] proposes that the government and regulators build legal and supervisory frameworks and encourage financial inclusion activities in the MENA region to improve the accessibility of financial systems. In the very vein [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>] demonstrate that financial inclusion programs result in a more significant proportion of the population participating in financial intermediation, promoting financial development and economic prosperity, which entails institutional structures. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>] inspected the influence of financial inclusion and bank concentration on company performance using a sample of 55,596 enterprises from 79 countries. The study reveals that financial inclusion has a favorable impact on firm performance.</p><p>[<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>] investigated that financial inclusion could help alleviate poverty by investigating 79 countries based on their socioeconomic levels. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>] reveal that financial institutions’ openness, depth, efficiency, and development positively affect the economic growth in seven European Union (EU) countries. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>] evaluated the association between financial inclusion and economic growth in 11 African economies, finding that financial inclusion is strongly and positively correlated with economic growth. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>] studied the macroeconomic factors of financial inclusion in 27 African countries through dynamic panel data techniques. It is revealed that the lagged value of financial inclusion, GDP per capita, and mobile infrastructure are all highly and positively related. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>] employed dynamic panel methodology and Granger causality tests in 55 nations from the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. The relationship between financial inclusion and economic growth was explored. The results show that financial inclusion stimulates economic growth. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>] report that Financial inclusion has evolved into a critical tool for alleviating poverty and increasing prosperity. Thus, the above-cited studies can be deduced that financial inclusion is vital in supporting employment, economic growth, and economic resilience.</p><h3>2.2. Studies on financial inclusion and financial innovation</h3><p>Another dimension of the purported research corresponds to studies unlocking that financial innovation and technology can improve financial inclusion. Over the last decade, financial innovation, such as new delivery channels, products, and intermediaries, has aided in the rapid expansion of financial inclusion in several countries. Interestingly, financial innovation in Fintech is gaining more interest because studies have revealed the importance and adoption of technologies in many dimensions of the landscape of financial products. For the case of south Asian countries, [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>], through the Panel ARDL, reveal the long-term and short-term favorable relationship between financial innovation and financial inclusion in the case of six South Asian countries—Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, and Srilanka. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>], through time-series data from 1980 to 2016, explores the relationship between financial innovation and economic growth in Lesotho. The NARDL model evaluates the relevance of financial innovation’s short-term and long-term effects on economic growth. In contrast, the ARDL bounds testing approach appraises long-run cointegration. The results of the limits tests suggested that financial innovation and economic growth in Lesotho are long-run cointegrated.</p><p>[<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>] employ the Panel ARDL in a linear and nonlinear framework to examine the link between financial inclusion and financial innovation, as well as financial development and remittance inflows, in the case of six South Asian countries—Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, and Srilanka—using monthly data from 1990M1 to 2018M12. A Granger-causality test has also been used to analyze directional causality using System GMM specification. The outcomes of the Panel ARDL study corroborated the long-term and short-term favorable relationship between financial innovation and financial inclusion. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>] emphasizes the importance of introducing modern financial technologies and their benefits. In line, Neural networks [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>], Artificial Intelligence &amp; the Internet of Things [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>], and the growth of Bitcoin hardware [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref038\" class=\"ref-tip\">38</a>] are among the adoption technologies researched. Studies reveal that financial and technological advances are inseparably linked, and they progress together throughout time. Financial innovations provide a way to fund innovative technology ventures, while technical advancement lays the groundwork for new financial solutions. Fintech and blockchain technology, in particular, have given rise to the most recent financial advances [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>]. The current financial institutions, such as banks and other financial organizations, provide the bulk of accessibility to financial products and services.</p><p>In today’s world, however, technology allows non-financial entities like telecommunication companies to provide financial services, a phenomenon known as fintech innovation. People who previously had no access to financial services are now empowered thanks to fintech advancements. Mobile money is a fintech invention frequently hailed as a crucial enabler of financial inclusion [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>] unfold that Fintech is one technology innovation that has arisen as a remedy to financial service inaccessibility, mainly via technology such as mobile phones. Studies have brought the positive approach and possible benefits of financial innovation. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>] highpoints the benefits of sustainable financial innovations that reduce financial system defects by lowering risk, closing the information gap, cutting transaction costs, and minimizing tax payments. Financial innovations are used in investment decisions to secure a high return on investment projects, reduce investment risk and transaction costs, and enhance access to varied investment options [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref045\" class=\"ref-tip\">45</a>]. In line, financial innovation deployed appropriately can enhance revenues (financial revenues) while cutting prices (financial costs), strengthening the company’s profitability and significance [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref046\" class=\"ref-tip\">46</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref047\" class=\"ref-tip\">47</a>].</p><p>Endogenous factors prompt financial institutions’ ability to create stiff competition amongst financial institutions (both traditional and non-traditional), short-term financial outcomes, the quest for revenue opportunities (other than interest revenues), and the escalating prominence of the risk management framework are all examples of new solutions [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref048\" class=\"ref-tip\">48</a>]. Globalization, accelerated financial market volatility, deregulation of capital flows, and the development of communication technology are the central exogenous factors inducing the increased activity of financial institutions in creating and implementing financial innovations. Studies have revealed that ATMs, telephone services, and Internet banking have boosted bank performance [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref049\" class=\"ref-tip\">49</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref050\" class=\"ref-tip\">50</a>]. Innovative product offerings and solutions, including real-time transaction and credit monitoring, branchless banking, peer-to-peer lending, and Robo-advisory services, including using social trading platforms in investing, are strengthening the financial services firm. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref051\" class=\"ref-tip\">51</a>]. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref052\" class=\"ref-tip\">52</a>] explored the liaison between financial innovation and economic growth in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. In the dataset of South Asian countries for Q1 1975 to Q4 2016, the ARDL bounds test was used to analyze long-run connections. The NARDL test examined the asymmetry between financial innovation and economic growth. The limits tests report long-run cointegration between financial innovation and economic development. NARDL also demonstrated that significant advances in financial innovation are tied to long-term economic growth. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref053\" class=\"ref-tip\">53</a>] addresses the long- and short-term effects of innovation and financial development on significant economic areas and integrate innovation with the finance-growth nexus at distinct income levels. This research shows that the finance–growth and innovation–growth links shift with timescales and income brackets, centered on a panel of data for 48 countries from 1971 to 2015. The importance of innovation in the growth process is considered in this study, which asserts that financial progress is not simply a remedy for sustainable economic growth.</p><p>Selected regional studies are brought to the fore. Using a panel of MENA nations from 2001 to 2012, [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref054\" class=\"ref-tip\">54</a>] looked into the linkages between financial inclusion, cell phone activity, and economic status. Mobile banking has a favorable effect on financial level and financial inclusion. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref055\" class=\"ref-tip\">55</a>] Investigate the association between fintech loans to businesses, consumers, and critical areas of financial development using data from 109 countries collected between 2015 and 2017. The study reveals that in nations where financial depth is declining, marketplace lending to consumers is increasing, emphasizing the significance of fintech credit in filling the credit gap left by traditional lenders. The findings demonstrate that low-income countries are exploiting the consumer fintech credit potential. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref056\" class=\"ref-tip\">56</a>] report that in Sub-Saharan Africa, new technologies are being developed and adopted that can alter the competitive landscape in the financial sector. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref057\" class=\"ref-tip\">57</a>] unlocks that China’s fintech companies have risen significantly faster than those in the United States. This experience has significant implications for comprehending financial innovation and building inclusive financial systems. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref058\" class=\"ref-tip\">58</a>] investigated the introduction of fintech companies into the American retail bank market. They found evidence of a favorable association between fintech financing and business growth.</p><p>There is evidence of a strong link between mobile phone penetration and financial inclusion [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref059\" class=\"ref-tip\">59</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref060\" class=\"ref-tip\">60</a>]. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref061\" class=\"ref-tip\">61</a>] reveal that FinTech (financial technology) is a crucial enabler of financial inclusion. Overall, the findings support the UN-2030-ASD and G20-HLP-DFI goals. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref062\" class=\"ref-tip\">62</a>] reports that FinTech lending has emerged as a potentially promising approach to reduce the cost of borrowing and enhance financial inclusion. The study reveals that FinTech credit can improve financial inclusion while outperforming traditional credit scoring. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref063\" class=\"ref-tip\">63</a>] reveal that Central banks in developed and developing nations have taken numerous steps to promote financial inclusion.</p><p>Further, the stipulated theme has also garnered global appeal, with the G-20, IMF, and World Bank Group engaging in generating and monitoring financial inclusion metrics and supporting efficient techniques to enhance financial inclusion. There is the mark of an encouraging association between mobile money use and consumer and corporate financial involvement. Household members with a mobile bank account are more likely to be banking. Further, they receive and send remittances more consistently and save additional money [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref064\" class=\"ref-tip\">64</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref065\" class=\"ref-tip\">65</a>]. Through its influence on expanded credit accessibility, Mobile payment has also been favorable to impact SME financial inclusion [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref066\" class=\"ref-tip\">66</a>]. FinTech is increasingly being viewed as a crucial enabler of financial inclusion. Mobile financial services are seen as the FinTech with the most remarkable ability to yield lower-income people into the economic mainstream [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref067\" class=\"ref-tip\">67</a>]. The study by [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref068\" class=\"ref-tip\">68</a>] unearths that in 49 countries, mobile phone innovation enhanced financial inclusion. In line, [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref069\" class=\"ref-tip\">69</a>] reveal noteworthy progress has been made in using financial innovations to increase financial inclusion in African countries over the last two decades. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref064\" class=\"ref-tip\">64</a>] reveal that financial innovations such as the handiness and use of cellulars provide financial services that encourage household savings and increase the amount saved in selected countries in sub-Saharan Africa. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref070\" class=\"ref-tip\">70</a>] reveal that formal financial services in the Arab world are available to 21% of the population, excluding the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Further, the Arab world falls behind other countries regarding account ownership and formal financial institution credit. Taken together, it can be deduced from the studies that financial innovation has accelerated the growth of financial inclusion in several countries.</p><h3>2.3. Studies on the role of FDI in providing financial inclusion through financial innovations</h3><p>The third dimension of the purported framework cover studies that investigate the role of FDI in providing a more comprehensive financial inclusion through financial innovations. FDI is critical for reshaping a stationary market into a vibrant one by ensuring the deployment and spread of technology, accelerating capital accumulation, and raising total factor productivity, which helps accelerate economic growth [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref071\" class=\"ref-tip\">71</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref072\" class=\"ref-tip\">72</a>]. Indeed, long-term capital investment is bolstered by the flow of foreign direct investment into the economic system and technological advancement and innovation [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref073\" class=\"ref-tip\">73</a>]. In the host country, FDI has become a critical avenue for transferring technological know-how, advanced technology, innovative ideas, reliable capital flows, and improved managerial abilities [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref074\" class=\"ref-tip\">74</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref075\" class=\"ref-tip\">75</a>]. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref076\" class=\"ref-tip\">76</a>] reveal that the results of the entirely feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) and panel-corrected standard errors (PCSE) estimators posit that FDI spurs FD in the zone both intrinsically and extrinsically via the supply of money. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref077\" class=\"ref-tip\">77</a>] unfold that most governments attempt to attract foreign investment to gain access to new technology, create jobs, and boost economic growth. New technology brought in by FDI can progress the host country’s production capacity and innovative capabilities. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref078\" class=\"ref-tip\">78</a>] uncover that developing the technology environment is critical to developing less developed countries’ economies. These countries can benefit from technologically advanced countries thanks to FDI. FDI is expected to provide a broader range of services and better access for different socio-economic communities through increased money supply [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref079\" class=\"ref-tip\">79</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref080\" class=\"ref-tip\">80</a>]. Overall, it is discerned that there is a shortage of studies on regional economic blocs. The Arab region entails critical studies on the thematic matter of financial inclusion and financial innovation. Thus, the present study investigates the linkage between Financial Inclusion and Financial Innovation with the mediating Role of Inflow of FDI in the Arab region. This study aims to lessen the research deficit on the purported theme. This endeavor shall enhance insight into Financial Inclusion and Innovation in the Arab region. The study’s findings shall aid policymakers in a better understanding of financial inclusion in Arab countries and improvise the financial inclusion policy [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref081\" class=\"ref-tip\">81</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref082\" class=\"ref-tip\">82</a>].</p><h2>3. Data and methodology</h2><p>We have selected 22 Arab countries and included data from 2004 to 2020. The GDP, exports, imports, and remittances are extracted from World Development Indicators (WDI) and OECD National Accounts data files. Data for FDI, number of ATMs, number of depositors, broad money, and little money are extracted from the Financial Access Survey (FAS), International Financial Statistics, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) balance of payment.</p><p>As outlined in the previous section, the prime focus of this study is to evaluate the influence of financial innovation on financial inclusion in Arab countries. Financial inclusion indicates a few characteristics, including accessibility, availability, and usability of financial services [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref083\" class=\"ref-tip\">83</a>]. It extends financial services to the unbanked population with the least cost through an efficient financial institution by offering various financial services, i.e., savings, loans, and fund transfers [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref084\" class=\"ref-tip\">84</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref085\" class=\"ref-tip\">85</a>]. Some studies employ proxy variables to capture the outcome of financial inclusion. However, the majority of them use depositors’ numbers with commercial banks as the primary proxy [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref086\" class=\"ref-tip\">86</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref087\" class=\"ref-tip\">87</a>], while others use proxies like several automated teller machines (ATMs) [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref088\" class=\"ref-tip\">88</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref089\" class=\"ref-tip\">89</a>]. Furthermore, financial innovation is a term for financial institutions that introduce noble products and improved services [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref090\" class=\"ref-tip\">90</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref091\" class=\"ref-tip\">91</a>]. This leads to efficient financial intermediation in the economy. Although there is no specific indicator to represent financial innovation, a few studies [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref090\" class=\"ref-tip\">90</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref092\" class=\"ref-tip\">92</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref093\" class=\"ref-tip\">93</a>] show the ratio of Narrow-to-Broad money to represent financial innovation.</p><p>This paper attempts to fill the gap by introducing proxy variables to measure financial inclusion (FI) and financial innovation (FIN). We consider financial inclusion (FI) represented by a few proxy variables, i.e., several automated telling machines (ATMs) depositors’ numbers with commercial banks, as dependent variables. In contrast, financial innovation (FIN) is indicated by the ratio between broad money (BM) and little money (NM) as the dependent variable. To increase the robustness of estimation, we have also included a few macroeconomic variables as control variables, i.e., GDP growth (Y), gross capital formation (GCF), foreign direct investment net inflows (FDII) (%of GDP), trade openness (TO) is the sum of export and import (%of GDP), and personal remittances (PR).</p><p>We examine the possible nonlinear relationships among FI, FIN, Y, GCF, FDII, TO, and PR in Arab countries. The existing literature on Arab countries pays little attention to the critical role of FIN on FI. Hence, the current study identifies the long-term relationships of certain variables in Arab economies. The present study focuses on FIN as a crucial indicator to explicate FI. It mainly incorporates the possible nonlinear relationships between FI and FIN, previously excluded in paned data analysis. Besides, this study is the first attempt to uncover the nonlinear relationships of the aforestated variables in the Arab economies. To reach our goals, this study adopts the following econometric steps: 1) we apply test Im, Pesaran, and Shin W-stat to detect the existence of unit roots, 2) we conduct cross-sectional dependence (CSD) test alternatively termed as CIPS and CADA recommended by [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref094\" class=\"ref-tip\">94</a>]. 3) After confirming the unit root in the existing panel dataset, we apply asymmetric [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref095\" class=\"ref-tip\">95</a>] panel cointegration tests following wastelands (error correction based) along with panel NARDL and system GMM approach. The details of panel NARDL and system GMM and methods are discussed later.</p><h3>3.1. Model specification</h3><p>Existing literature examined the relationships among FI, FIN, Y, GCF, FDI, TO, and R with mixed results but ignored the importance of FIN as a key factor of FI, particularly in Arab countries. We attempted to contribute to the existing stock of literature by extending the model suggested by [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref096\" class=\"ref-tip\">96</a>], which can be shown as follows:\\n<a name=\"pone.0287475.e001\" id=\"pone.0287475.e001\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.e001\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(1)</span></span>\\n<a name=\"pone.0287475.e002\" id=\"pone.0287475.e002\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.e002\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(2)</span></span></p><p>Subscripts t and I indicate periods and the number of countries, respectively. We have included Y, GCF, FDII, TO, and PR as control variables and ε<sub>t</sub> as the error term.</p><h3>3.2. Cross-sectional dependence</h3><p>The Arab economies have certain commonalities because of their mutual economic associations. Therefore, we apply the cross-sectional dependence (CSD) test [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref097\" class=\"ref-tip\">97</a>] in our panel dataset with the null hypothesis of cross-sectional independence. This test generates efficient and reliable results [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref098\" class=\"ref-tip\">98</a>]. Some studies apply the CSD test before estimating the results to confirm the absence of CSD [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref099\" class=\"ref-tip\">99</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref101\" class=\"ref-tip\">101</a>]\\n<a name=\"pone.0287475.e003\" id=\"pone.0287475.e003\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.e003\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(3)</span></span></p><h3>3.3. Unit root test</h3><p>The first-generation econometrics that ignores the presence of CSD are unit root tests used by ADF. This has been modified [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref094\" class=\"ref-tip\">94</a>] that focused on cross-section augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF) and CIPS (Crossectional -augmented IPS, 2003) tests for testing both stationarity and heterogeneity present in panel data [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref102\" class=\"ref-tip\">102</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref103\" class=\"ref-tip\">103</a>]. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref094\" class=\"ref-tip\">94</a>] modified CADF and CIPS unit root tests by applying a standard structure. The CADF test is calculated based on OLS estimation procedures with the standard Dickey-Fuller (DF) regression:\\n<a name=\"pone.0287475.e004\" id=\"pone.0287475.e004\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.e004\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(4)</span></span>\\nwhere y<sub>it−1</sub> and Δy<sub>it−1</sub> denotes the cross-sectional averages of lagged and first difference value of the dependent variable, respectively, whereas CIPS statistics indicate the average of individual CADF statistics such as:\\n<a name=\"pone.0287475.e005\" id=\"pone.0287475.e005\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.e005\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(5)</span></span></p><p>CADF and CIPS tests allow for the null hypothesis of unit root against the alternative hypothesis with at least a single unit of the panel stationary. The main goal of the unit root test is to determine whether the shocks to FI FIN, Y, GCF, FDII, TO, and PR are permanent or temporary. These tests also suggest information on decomposing the variables. The static variables will indicate a temporary impact, i.e., financial inclusion, financial innovation, GDP growth, GCF, FDI, export, import, TO, and PR. The variables are assumed to be stable after any external shock. On the contrary, if any variable exhibits a unit root, its impact will last long, and consideration must be given to its volatility. Besides, a long-run relationship between the variables and the system’s unit root will only have temporary effects.</p><h3>3.4. Asymmetric cointegration analysis</h3><p>To avoid spurious regression, we test the cointegration properties of related variables within the panel data. We conduct a linear cointegration test before the asymmetric cointegration test. Since CSD is a crucial issue for the cointegration test, we conduct a particular cointegration test, as Westerlund (2007) suggested, which controls for CSD in the panel dataset and applies an error correction approach to detect the potential cointegrating relationships in the panel. Hidden cointegration is another novel test that examines the cointegrating relations between the positive and negative shocks on the variable [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref095\" class=\"ref-tip\">95</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref104\" class=\"ref-tip\">104</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref106\" class=\"ref-tip\">106</a>]. It assumes that cointegrating relations can be hidden within the positive and negative elements of the variable.</p><p>In contrast, there can be no relation in the only positive form of the variable because of the incidence of possible unknown dynamics within a non-cointegrated relation which moves away from the component of the variables rather than the variables themselves. Besides, the decomposition of FI, FIN, Y, GCF, FDII, TO, and PR is essential because of changes in financial and economic policies over the years, which can create a structural break in the model and thus fail to capture the effect in the long run. Throughout the study period (1980–2020), various financial and economic changes took place globally, such as the economic crisis of 2008 and the oil price shock in 2014.</p><h3>3.5. Panel NARDL</h3><p>Before introducing the panel NARDL model, let us begin with the following structure of Panel ARDL [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref107\" class=\"ref-tip\">107</a>]:\\n<a name=\"pone.0287475.e006\" id=\"pone.0287475.e006\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.e006\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(6)</span></span></p><p>Under the asymmetric ARDL, we examine the positive and negative effects of independent variables in the equation. We test only one asymmetric relation, such as the financial innovation (FIN) response to financial inclusion (FI). The following equation represents the panel NARDL model adopted in this study:\\n<a name=\"pone.0287475.e007\" id=\"pone.0287475.e007\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.e007\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(7)</span></span></p><p>FIN+, FIN- and FDII+, FDII- represent positive and negative changes in financial innovation and foreign direct investment inflow.

Panel granger causality test</h3><p>We test system GMM-based panel granger causality as [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref108\" class=\"ref-tip\">108</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref111\" class=\"ref-tip\">111</a>] recommended. We adopt a causality test with a panel error correction framework to detect the causal direction among financial inclusion, financial innovation, GDP growth, GCF, FDII, export, import, TO, and PR. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref108\" class=\"ref-tip\">108</a>] suggest two steps: firstly, estimating dynamic-OLS for retrieving the residuals, and secondly, estimating DOLS with an error correction term (ECT) with first-lagged values that allow the presence of long-run causality. Both short-run and long-run causality equations are as follows:\\n<a name=\"pone.0287475.e017\" id=\"pone.0287475.e017\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.e017\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(11)</span></span>\\n<a name=\"pone.0287475.e018\" id=\"pone.0287475.e018\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.e018\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(12)</span></span>\\n<a name=\"pone.0287475.e019\" id=\"pone.0287475.e019\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.e019\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(13)</span></span>\\n<a name=\"pone.0287475.e020\" id=\"pone.0287475.e020\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.e020\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(14)</span></span>\\n<a name=\"pone.0287475.e021\" id=\"pone.0287475.e021\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.e021\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(15)</span></span>\\n<a name=\"pone.0287475.e022\" id=\"pone.0287475.e022\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.e022\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(16)</span></span>\\n<a name=\"pone.0287475.e023\" id=\"pone.0287475.e023\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.e023\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(17)</span></span></p><h3>3.7. Dynamic panel system generalized method of moments (SYS-GMM)</h3><p>In this study, we also adopt the extended version of dynamic panel models like moments of the method (GMM) introduced by [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref112\" class=\"ref-tip\">112</a>] and further modified by [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref113\" class=\"ref-tip\">113</a>]. We focus on the dynamic panel system generalized method of moments (SYS-GMM) model to address the problem of possible simultaneity and to further examine the relationship among FIN, FI, Y, GCF, FDII, EX, IM, too, and R. We exclude the first difference GMM method due to its biased estimation from the weak instrument with small sample size and the issue of endogeneity as the variables tend to follow random walk process [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref113\" class=\"ref-tip\">113</a>]. Therefore, we consider SYS-GMM to overcome the limitations of the first difference GMM [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref114\" class=\"ref-tip\">114</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref115\" class=\"ref-tip\">115</a>]. Since we have different groups, we apply Sargan and Hansen J statistics to test the over-identification problem of the instruments.</p><h2>4. Data analysis and interpretation</h2><p>The study began with a preliminary data properties assessment of typical dynamism and sharing properties. The study performed cross-sectional dependency among the selected variables for the study by performing [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref097\" class=\"ref-tip\">97</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref116\" class=\"ref-tip\">116</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref118\" class=\"ref-tip\">118</a>], and the test of heterogeneity following [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref119\" class=\"ref-tip\">119</a>]. The cross-sectional dependency and heterogeneity test results are displayed in <a href=\"#pone-0287475-t001\">Table 1</a>. The estimation test statistics confirm the presence of typical dynamism among the units, i.e., the rejection of cross-sectional independence; moreover, the test statistics of heterogeneity, i.e., Δ and adj.Δ. Study findings establish the availability of heterogeneous properties in the selected data set by rejecting the null hypothesis of homogeneity at a 1% level of significance.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.t001</a></p><p>Next<strong>, the</strong> study moves to gauge the variable’s order of integration by performing both conventional panel unit root, following Levin–Lin–Chu test [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref120\" class=\"ref-tip\">120</a>], the Im–Pesaran–Shin test [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref121\" class=\"ref-tip\">121</a>] and the Fisher-ADF [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref122\" class=\"ref-tip\">122</a>] which have the null hypothesis all the panel contains a unit root and results display in <a href=\"#pone-0287475-t002\">Table 2</a>; furthermore, panel unit root tests are efficient in handling the presence of cross-sectional dependency in the data set, commonly known as CIPS and CADA proposed by [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref094\" class=\"ref-tip\">94</a>]. The results of panel unit root tests are exhibited in <a href=\"#pone-0287475-t003\">Table 3</a>. Referring to the results report in <a href=\"#pone-0287475-t002\">Table 2</a>, it is manifested that variables are stationary either at level or/. After the first difference, neither variable is exposed to stationary after the seco<sup>nd</sup> difference.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.t002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.t002</a></p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.t003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.t003</a></p><p>The following results of panel unit root tests with CIPS and CADF are displayed in <a href=\"#pone-0287475-t003\">Table 3</a> under the assumption of constant and constant &amp; trends. Test statistics under both estimations ascertain the variables are stationary in mixed order, implying variables are stationary either at a level or/and first difference. Now, we can perform empirical target models with econometrical methodology.</p><p>Before gauging the long-run elasticity running from financial innovation to financial inclusion in the empirical assessment, here, the study evaluates long-run cointegration by performing a panel cointegration test initiated by [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref123\" class=\"ref-tip\">123</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref124\" class=\"ref-tip\">124</a>], Kao residual test [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref125\" class=\"ref-tip\">125</a>], and ECM-based cointegration test introduced by [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref126\" class=\"ref-tip\">126</a>]. The results of the panel cointegration test are exhibited in <a href=\"#pone-0287475-t004\">Table 4</a>. Panel–A in <a href=\"#pone-0287475-t004\">Table 4</a> reports Pedroni panel cointegration test statistics. Nine out of eleven coefficients are statistically significant at a 1% significance level. Findings ascertain the long-run association in the empirical model. The Kao residual test results, see panel–B in <a href=\"#pone-0287475-t004\">Table 4</a>, ADF test statistics documented as statistically significant at a 1% level, implying the rejection of the null hypothesis of no-cointegration. Panel C in <a href=\"#pone-0287475-t004\">Table 4</a> displays the results of the panel cointegration test following [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref126\" class=\"ref-tip\">126</a>]. It is apparent from the associated p-value that all the test statistics are statistically significant at a 1% significant level, indicating the rejection of the null hypothesis of \"no-cointegration.\" Hence, the panel cointegration tests suggest the availability of a long-run association between financial innovation and financial inclusion in the Arab world.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.t004\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.t004</a></p><p>Next, the study moves to perform the preliminary assessment for detecting the association between financial innovation and financial inclusion through the execution of OLS, Random effects (RE, hereafter), and fixed effects (FE, hereafter). Results of baseline estimation are displayed in <a href=\"#pone-0287475-t005\">Table 5</a>. Referring to the Hausman test’s test statistics, the fixed effects model can efficiently estimate the elasticity of variables in the equation. Study findings document positive, statistically significant effects from financial innovation to financial inclusion in model -1 (a coefficient of 0.634) and model -2 (0.898). Study findings suggest that the financial system’s adaptation and diffusion of financial innovation play a catalyst in accumulating unbanked populations into formal financial institutions. On the other hand, the inflows of FDI establish mixed positive and negative effects, which vary with model estimation following different econometrical tools. However, according to target model estimation, i.e., the FE model documents a positive and statistically significant tie between financial inclusion and inflows of FDI in the model (a coefficient of 0.058) and model 2 (a coefficient of 0.459). Inflows of FDI can augment the financial inclusion process so that the Arab world can exercise progress in the financial sector with foreign cash flows.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.t005\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.t005</a></p><p><a href=\"#pone-0287475-t006\">Table 6</a> displays model estimation results following econometrical techniques of GMM and system-GMM with financial innovation measures by access to financial services (for model -1) and access to financial products (for model -2). For model -1, the coefficient of financial innovation documents positive and statistically significant association with financial inclusion in both GMM (a coefficient of 0.271) and system-GMM estimation (a coefficient of 0.180). The finding suggests that the development of financial innovation in the economy can play an essential role in accelerating financial inclusion. Financial innovation allows the unbanked population to avail of financial services and incorporates them into the formal financial system. The existing literature supports our study findings; see [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref127\" class=\"ref-tip\">127</a>]. In particular, a 10% development in financial innovation can facilitate unbanked population inclusion into the formal financial system by 1.8% to 2.71%. Financial innovation and inclusion are helping countries get out of poverty to have a more inclusive economy. It is becoming increasingly common for people to use internet banking, mobile banking, short message service banking, electronic banking (e-banking), agents, mobile money accounts, and mobile wallet banking. This is bringing the unbanked into the financial system.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.t006\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.t006</a></p><p>Refers to FDI impacts on financial inclusion. The study establishes a positive, statistically significant association, suggesting that continual foreign capital inflows induce the scope of financial services available to the population. The study findings align with the existing literature [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref088\" class=\"ref-tip\">88</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref128\" class=\"ref-tip\">128</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref129\" class=\"ref-tip\">129</a>]. Specifically, a 10% growth in FDI inflows can augment the speed of unbanked population inclusion into a formal system by 3.19% in GMM estimation and 2.55% in system-GMM estimation by offering a diversified financial services economy. FDI’s impact on financial inclusion can be addressed directly and indirectly. Refers to the direct linkage between FDI and financial inclusion, existing literature postulated that financial intermediation and efficiency boost and attract foreign investors; thus, the host economy continuously ensures improved financial products and services and easy access to formal financial systems. It suggests that inflows of FDI inject pressure to offer better financial institutions and financial facilities, eventually augmenting the financial inclusion process that unbanked population inclusion into the formal financial channel. While in terms of the indirect impact of FDI on financial inclusion, inflows of FDI accelerate economic progress and host country population income possibilities. Excess money flows in the economy induce financial integration, implying that people tend to move savings propensity for future consumption. The actions of populations inclined toward financial institutions act as a catalyst and perused financial institutions to offer better and improved financial products and services, eventually augmenting the development of financial inclusion at large. Furthermore, since personal remittances and economic growth adversely cause the present trend of financial inclusion, trade openness plays a directive role in further developing financial inclusion.</p><p>For model -2, access to financial products is a proxy for financial inclusion. Study findings disclosed the positive association between financial innovation (a coefficient of 0.490 for GMM estimation) and (a coefficient of 0.298 for system-GMM estimation) and financial inclusion. These findings suggest that a 10% growth in financial innovation in the financial system can accelerate financial inclusion, i.e., the unbanked population can avail of the benefits of finical products offered by the financial instructions by 2.98% to 4.9%. On the other hand, inflows of FDI document an adverse statistically significant connection with financial inclusion (a coefficient of -0.03 in GMM estimation) and (a coefficient of -0.011 in the system–GMM). These findings suggest that foreign capital inflows in the economy deter the inclusion process by offering financial products, such as credit facilities, in the economy. The possible explanation is that the availability of money supply may discourage the population from reaching financial institutions to expand existing capacity through credit extension. Moreover, according to the control variables’ impact on financial inclusion, it is apparent that gross capital formation and economic growth positively cause financial inclusion. However, adverse effects can be observed from personal remittances and trade openness, validated in GMM and system-GMM estimation.</p><p>The nonlinear effects of financial innovation and inflows of FDI on financial inclusion investigate by following the nonlinear framework introduced by shin. Results of asymmetric estimation are displayed in <a href=\"#pone-0287475-t007\">Table 7</a>, consisting of three output panels. For long-run elasticity (see panel–A in <a href=\"#pone-0287475-t007\">Table 7</a>), study findings reveal asymmetric shocks in financial innovation, i.e., the positive shocks (a coefficient of 0.128) and the negative shock (a coefficient of 0.169) positively liked with financial inclusion, which is measured by access to financial services. These findings suggest that the positive and negative shocks critically influence the progress of the unbanked population inclusion into the formal financial system in innovativeness in the financial system. A 10% shock in either direction can result in 1.28% development with favorable financial innovation variations. In contrast, downward movement can be observed by 1.69% due to negative innovation in the financial system. Hence, it is apparent that negative shock magnitudes are more robust than favorable variations in cause-effects output.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.t007\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.t007</a></p><p>Study findings suggest that the financial sector must accelerate financial inclusion in credit product accessibility. It implies that excessive innovativeness is destructive in including the unbanked population in the formal financial system. On the other hand, (see, Panel-A, model -2), the asymmetric effects of financial innovation, that is, positive shocks (a coefficient of -0.058) and adverse shocks (a coefficient of -0.086) documents positively tied with financial inclusion, which is measured by access for credit products in the financial system. The asymmetric effects of FDI inflows that are positive and negative on financial inclusion establish a positive, statistically significant tie in the long run. Precisely a 10% augmentation in FDI inflows can accelerate financial inclusion by 0.80% in model 1 and by 0.94% in model 2 due to positive shock; at the same time, negative variations can result in a decrease in the inclusion process by 0.45% in model-1 and by 0.25% in model-2. It is apparent from the elasticities of asymmetric effects from FDI inflows on financial inclusion that persistent inflows of FDI can catalyze the unbanked population inclusion in the formal system. Therefore, economic policy pertinent to international capital flows can also increase financial inclusion in the financial system.</p><p>Findings suggest the role of financial innovation in accelerating financial inclusion. For the short-run (see panel-B), the coefficients of error correction document negative statistically significant (a coefficient of -0.451) in model -1 and (a coefficient of -0.142) in model 2, indicating the long-run convergence due to prior year shocks in variables. Asymmetric shocks in financial innovation, negative variations, exhibit negative linkage (a coefficient of -0.001) in the model– 1. Positive shocks (a coefficient of 0.015) and adverse shocks (a coefficient of 0.001) establish positive statistically significant linkage in model -2. However, in terms of coefficient elasticities, the minimal effects can address. During the asymmetric effects of FDI on financial innovation, only the positive shocks establish a statistically significant linkage with financial inclusion, such as a coefficient of 0.013 in model -1 and 0.025 in model -2, respectively. These findings suggest financial inclusion process can be intensified by the continual receipt of FDI in the economy, but the effects are minimal.</p><p>Panel–C in <a href=\"#pone-0287475-t007\">Table 7</a> displays the results of the symmetry test. Study findings document the long-run asymmetry of financial innovation to financial inclusion, which applies to both model estimations. Only model 2 exposes asymmetry associations between financial innovation and financial inclusion in the short run. Moreover, the Wald test statistics confirm the asymmetric association between FDI inflows and financial inclusion in the long and short run. These conclusions apply to both model implementations.</p><p>Next, the directional causality between financial innovation and financial inclusion is gauged by performing a granger causality test with System-GMM specification following [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref109\" class=\"ref-tip\">109</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref130\" class=\"ref-tip\">130</a>]. The causality test results in <a href=\"#pone-0287475-t008\">Table 8</a> consist of two output panels. Panel–A in <a href=\"#pone-0287475-t008\">Table 8</a> shows causalities among selected variables where financial inclusion is measured by access to financial services. Study findings document several directional causalities in estimation. The study disclosed the <em>feedback hypothesis</em> holds for explaining the causality between financial innovation and financial inclusion [FIN←→FI], gross capital formation and financial inclusion [GCF←→FI] and trade openness and financial inclusion [TO←→FI]. Furthermore, unidirectional causality runs from financial inclusion to inflows of FDI [FDI←FI] and financial inclusion to remittances [PR←FI]. On the other hand, Panel B in <a href=\"#pone-0287475-t008\">Table 8</a> reports causality test results where financial inclusion is proxied by access to financial services. The study ascertains the bidirectional causality running between financial innovation and financial inclusion [FIN←→FI], gross capital formation and financial inclusion [GCF←→FI], and trade openness to financial inclusion [TO←→FI]. Moreover, unidirectional causality runs from financial inclusion to inflows of FDI [FI→FDI] and financial inclusion to remittances [FI→PR].</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.t008\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.t008</a></p><h3>4.1.

The study documented a positive and statistically significant link between financial inclusion and financial innovation with a coefficient of 0.535 (0.269). Furthermore, the effects of FDI inflows on financial inclusion exposed positively and statistically significant, with a coefficient of 0.025 (0.084). Considering the nexus between explanatory variables and financial inclusion, it is conclusively revealed that each coefficient’s sign and significance align with System-GMM estimation, which is the study’s prime output.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.t009\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287475.t009</a></p><h2>5. Discussion</h2><p>Study findings reveal asymmetric shocks in financial innovation, i.e., the positive shocks (a coefficient of 0.128) and the negative shock (a coefficient of 0.169) positively liked with financial inclusion, measured by access to financial services. These findings suggest that the positive and negative shocks critically influence the progress of the unbanked population inclusion into the formal financial system in innovativeness in the financial system. A 10% shock in either direction can result in 1.28% development with favorable financial innovation variations. In contrast, downward movement can be observed by 1.69% due to negative innovation in the financial system. Hence, it is apparent that negative shock magnitudes are more robust than favorable variations in cause-effects output. Financial innovation is revolutionizing how consumers access and use financial services, providing greater inclusion and access to financial products and services than ever before, and has been achieved by introducing new technologies, such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing, enabling innovative financial product development. These products can expedite access to financial services for those traditionally excluded from the mainstream, such as those without bank accounts or poor credit ratings. Financial innovation has improved the consumer experience by providing convenient, cost-effective, and tailored financial services. Additionally, it has reduced transaction costs and time associated with conducting transactions in different countries. All in all, financial innovation has played an essential role in advancing financial inclusion across the world[<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref132\" class=\"ref-tip\">132</a>].</p><p>By leveraging technology and alternative data sources, financial innovation can provide more accessible, affordable, and secure financial services to those previously underserved, particularly for the unbanked and underbanked population, who are often left out of traditional financial services due to limited access or lack of resources. Also, financial innovation has enabled advances in digital payments, remittances, and other financial services, making it easier for the unbanked and underbanked populations to access greater financial inclusion. By utilizing technology and alternative data sources, financial innovation can provide more accessible, affordable, and secure financial services to those previously left out of traditional banking systems due to limited access or lack of resources. Consequently, this has been highly instrumental in increasing financial inclusion for people who would otherwise not have access to these vital services.</p><p>In conclusion, financial innovation has enabled millions of people to access financial services, such as loans and savings, that they may have otherwise been excluded from due to a lack of resources. Financial innovation has made it easier for people to save, invest, and manage their money more efficiently. This has resulted in greater financial inclusion and stability for individuals, businesses, and governments worldwide. By leveraging the power of technological advancements such as blockchain and AI, financial innovation’s impact on global finance will only increase over time.</p><p>Foreign direct investment (FDI) can positively and negatively affect financial inclusion. It can help to create financial opportunities for individuals, businesses, and economies. However, it can also contribute to excluding certain groups from access to financial services and resources. On the one hand, FDI can lead to increased access to capital for companies in emerging markets, which in turn helps them invest in their businesses and expand their operations, which leads to more employment and economic growth opportunities for those otherwise excluded from traditional finance systems due to a lack of access or resources. On the other hand, FDI can negatively affect local communities if it comes with an influx of foreign workers who can pay higher salaries than locals because they are not subject to the same labor laws or regulations. This can lead to a situation where locals cannot compete with foreign workers, creating further exclusion from access to finance.</p><p>Moreover, foreign direct investment (FDI) is an essential source of capital for many countries. It can have a positive impact on financial inclusion. FDI can help to create jobs, increase access to financial services, improve the quality of services, and reduce poverty. It also encourages the development of better infrastructure. It increases economic competition, which can lead to more efficient markets. As such, FDI can potentially improve access to banking services, credit products, insurance products, investments, and other financial instruments for individuals currently excluded from these services due to low incomes or lack of experience using traditional banking channels. In this way, FDI may help close gaps in levels of financial inclusion among various groups in society by creating more opportunities for all individuals regardless of income level or experience with traditional banking</p><h2>6. Conclusion and policy suggestions</h2><p>Bringing the unbanked people into the financial network is one of the deterministic facts in achieving sustainable development goals. Therefore, financial institutions have relentlessly worked on financial inclusion by adapting and diffusing FI in the financial sector over the recent decades. The current study seeks to determine whether financial innovation accelerates financial inclusion in the Arab world. We performed several econometric tools with two empirical models to gauge the association and magnitudes running from financial innovation to financial inclusion, and the key findings of the study are summarized as follows:</p><p>First, the study begins with an elementary assessment before initiating focused model estimation. The panel unit root test outcomes ascertain that both variables are interpreted in mixed order, either at a level or after the first difference. The association, in the long run, ascertains the panel cointegration test application following [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref123\" class=\"ref-tip\">123</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref124\" class=\"ref-tip\">124</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref126\" class=\"ref-tip\">126</a>]. Furthermore, preliminary empirical model estimation executed by implementing OLS, RE, and FE and the Hausman test ascertains that the FE model is efficient and consistent.</p><p>Second, the estimations of GMM and system–GMM estimation for gauging the magnitudes of financial innovation and FDI inflows on financial inclusion in the Arab world reveal that positive and statistically significant impacts are moving from financial innovation to financial inclusion in both estimations. This finding aligns with empirical literature [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>]. These outcomes suggest that innovativeness in the financial system produces ample diversification opportunities in offering financial products and services, thus allowing greater ease of extension for unbanked people into the formal banking network. [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref133\" class=\"ref-tip\">133</a>] postulated that a robust financial system could offer various financial products and services to unbanked people. Access to formal financial products and services will encourage the poor and unbanked people to invest in education and human development projects, positively impacting the economy [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref134\" class=\"ref-tip\">134</a>]. Similarly, the inflows of FDI disclose a positive tie with FI, supported by the empirical literature. FDI inflows contribute to the economy in diversified ways; however, the financial sector’s impact is more evident since foreign investors prefer to reallocate capital to those economies with higher efficiency and lower cost [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref135\" class=\"ref-tip\">135</a>]. FDI in the financial sector, especially in the banking sector, allows foreign participants in the baking industry and their presence to play catalyst roles and establish financial stability [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref136\" class=\"ref-tip\">136</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref140\" class=\"ref-tip\">140</a>].</p><p>Third, the asymmetric impacts of financial innovation and inflows of FDI on FI are evaluated by performing empirical models with a nonlinear model familiarized by [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref141\" class=\"ref-tip\">141</a>]. The Wald test results for symmetry document long-run asymmetry effects from financial innovation and inflows of FDI. Moreover, considering the magnitudes of financial innovation’s asymmetric effects, positive and negative shocks expose a positive, statistically significant linkage in model -1 and a negative, statistically significant tie in model -2. These findings suggest that over a long period, FIN impact varies with the appropriate selection of measures for FIN, implying that FI inclusion with augmenting financial services is case adaptation. Diffusion of FIN can result in positive growth. In contrast, controlled FIN can be an appropriate strategy for FI financial inclusion by offering financial products to the unbanked population.</p><p>Fifth, the directional association among researched variables is evaluated using the granger causality test with system-GMM following the specifications of [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref109\" class=\"ref-tip\">109</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref130\" class=\"ref-tip\">130</a>]. The estimation ascertains the presence of bidirectional causality between FIN and FI, which aligns with [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref142\" class=\"ref-tip\">142</a>]. In addition, our findings are also aligned with [<a href=\"#pone.0287475.ref133\" class=\"ref-tip\">133</a>], who advocated that giving financial access to firms and households through a variety of banking services and increasing the number of female users of these services lead to higher economic growth. Moreover, the sectors dependent on external finance grow more rapidly in countries with high FI levels. Lastly, the above findings suggest that financial innovation, trade openness, and institutional quality should continue in the selected countries to enhance financial inclusion and promote capital formation in the selected countries.</p><p>Taking account of the above study findings, the following policy suggestions have proposed for further development. There is a need for more financial inclusion in Arab nations in order to spur economic growth and development. However, the current financial landscape in Arab nations is not conducive to financial inclusion. In particular, there is a lack of access to formal financial institutions and products, as well as a lack of awareness of financial services among the population. There are several policy suggestions that could help increase financial inclusion in Arab nations. Firstly, there needs to be greater access to formal financial institutions and products. This can be achieved through initiatives such as providing subsidies for those who open bank accounts, or by increasing the number of banking outlets in rural and underserved areas. Secondly, awareness-raising campaigns are needed to educate the population about the importance of financial inclusion and the available services. Lastly, regulation needs to be put in place to ensure that financial institutions are providing inclusive products and services that meet the needs of all segments of the population. The above policy suggestions would go a long way in promoting financial inclusion in Arab nations and contributing to economic growth and development.</p><p>The future study can be initiated by taking account of country specific assessment in order to formulate more exact policy formulation and implementation that is sectoral data for empirical infestation</p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>The authors wish to thank anonymous referees for all value comments.

We examined the survival rates of patients and grafts for hospital inpatients admitted during weekends and those admitted during weekdays. To be included, the study had to be in English and had to provide discrete survival data around weekends versus weekdays, including patients who were admitted as inpatients over the weekend.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Five studies (n = 163,506 patients) were examined. The hazards ratio (HR) of the survival rate of patients with weekend transplantation was 1.01 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96 to 1.06) when compared with patients with weekday transplantation. Patients who had renal transplant on weekends had an overall allograft survival HR of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.03) and death-censored allograft survival HR of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.98 to 1.04).

Introduction</h2><p>The “weekend effect” is the finding of worse outcomes in patients admitted on the weekend than in those admitted during weekday and that patients admitted on the weekend had higher rates of adverse events and death [<a href=\"#pone.0287447.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>]. Over the past several decades, the issue of the weekend effect has been reported by several studies [<a href=\"#pone.0287447.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287447.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>], which have suggested an increasing global mortality in patients admitted to hospitals during weekends compared with those admitted during weekdays. Many studies [<a href=\"#pone.0287447.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287447.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>] have shown a significantly worse outcome among patients admitted on a weekend for various emergency medical and surgical conditions, including myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, or stroke, and many other critical illnesses requiring admissions in the intensive care units. Al Zamel et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287447.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>] pointed out that the reduction of experienced staff during weekends may lead to insufficient nursing care, which, in turn, may lead to aggravation or irreversibility of illness. Groves et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287447.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>] believe that patients admitted to hospitals on weekends may be unwilling to undergo surgery or experience delay in receiving necessary intervention, which leads to poor prognosis. Another possibility is that there may be differences in the severity of diseases or complications between patients admitted on weekends and those admitted on weekdays [<a href=\"#pone.0287447.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. Some studies [<a href=\"#pone.0287447.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>] have reported a difference in graft survival rate between patients admitted in hospitals on weekends and weekdays. However, whether there is a weekend effect in patients who undergo renal transplantation is uncertain. Because of the inconsistency between studies on the existence of this effect, we aimed to determine, through a meta-analysis, whether weekend transplantation had any influence on graft and patient survival rates. In this study, we also aimed to examine the association between the day (weekend versus weekday) of kidney transplant surgery on both complications and rejection.</p><h2>2. Methods</h2><h3>2.1. Data sources and searches</h3><p>We performed a literature search (January 2000 to January 2023) of multiple databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Two reviewers (Haifeng Wang and Yi Yi) independently evaluated the full article of each abstract. Any dispute was resolved by a third reviewer (Xiaoli Huang). The terms “weekend,” “weekend effect,” and “renal or kidney transplantation” were searched in the title and abstract. The related-articles function was used to broaden the search, all conference abstracts, and retrieved studies.</p><h3>2.2. Study selection</h3><p>To be included in the systematic review, the study had to be in English and had to provide mortality data on weekends (including holidays) versus weekdays, including patients who were admitted as inpatients over the weekend. We excluded studies that were letters, editorials, case reports, and so on.</p><h3>2.3. Data extraction</h3><p>Three experienced investigators (Tan Xiao, Aiqing Li and Yongfei Liu) independently analyzed the final defined articles for the primary and secondary parameters. The primary parameters included patient, overall, and death-censored graft survival, and secondary parameters included the initial length of hospital stay after transplantation, delayed allograft function (defined as use of dialysis in the first week after transplantation), and acute rejection (if treated for acute rejection, with or without biopsy) within the first year after transplantation. Unexpected discrepancies were carefully discussed and resolved during this process.</p><h3>2.4. Quality assessment</h3><p>Standard quality evaluation of the five included studies [<a href=\"#pone.0287447.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287447.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>] was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale.</p><h3>2.5. Data synthesis and analysis</h3><p>Relevant parameters explored using RevMan software (Version 5.3; Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) included operative time, warm ischemia time, estimated blood loss, and length of hospital stay. For continuous data, we calculated the weighted mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For dichotomous data, odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with 95% CI. Heterogeneity among studies was measured using the I<sup>2</sup> and Cochran’s Q tests (Mantel‐Haenszel χ<sup>2</sup> test). In cases of significant heterogeneity (χ<sup>2</sup> <em>P</em> value ≥0.1), a fixed-effect model was selected. Otherwise, a random-effects model was used.</p><h2>3. Results</h2><h3>3.1. Literature selection and screening</h3><p>A literature search retrieved 987 unique citations, of which 187 studies were obtained from PubMed, 456 articles were from EMBASE, and 344 articles were from the Cochrane Library. Thirty-seven publications were subsequently eliminated because they were obvious duplicates, and another 570 were excluded after title and abstract review, which included irrelevant research studies, reviews, and case reports. Three hundred eighty publications were full-text articles, of which only five articles (n = 163,506 patients) met the criteria mentioned above and were recommended for this meta-analysis. Across all five articles, 28% and 72% of the patients underwent transplantation on a weekday and a weekend, respectively. The study selection and screening process is shown in <a href=\"#pone-0287447-g001\">Fig 1</a>.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287447.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287447.g001</a></p><h3>3.2.

Patient survival was defined as the time from kidney transplant to death (from any cause) or last contact with the patient alive. The pooled studies were homogenous (<em>P</em> = 0.78). With the fixed-effects model, the HR of the survival rate of patients with weekend transplantation was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.96 to 1.06) when compared with patients with weekday transplantation.

Overall graft survival was defined as the time from kidney transplant to death (from any cause), graft failure, or last contact, whichever occurred first. There was no associated heterogeneity (<em>P</em> = 0.51).

Discussion</h2><p>This meta-analysis examined five retrospective studies involving 163,506 patients and compared the clinical outcomes between the weekend and weekday groups to determine whether kidney transplants performed during weekends have worse outcomes than those performed during weekdays. Results showed no significant differences in patient and graft survival. Most deceased-donor kidney transplants are emergency operations, and the time point of transplantation depends on the time point of kidney acquisition. The cold ischemia time of most deceased-donor kidneys is around 5–10 hours, and a longer cold ischemia time can lead to an increase in the proportion of delayed renal function recovery after transplantation [<a href=\"#pone.0287447.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287447.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>].</p><p>Our data also conflict with published observations on the weekend effect that would be considered relevant to deceased-donor kidney allograft recipients. By integrating the latest research results, our study found no difference in survival between patients and allografts. As all transplantation-related standardized procedures, including matching, allocation, scores promoting special subgroups of patients, immunosuppression protocols and early post-op care are standardized for years. Furthermore, a well-trained and experienced transplant surgeon can greatly promote the effectiveness of transplantation. The decision-making algorithm during the transplantation process is clear, and low-level physicians always consult with senior attending physicians over the phone (if necessary) in individual cases of problems or any uncertainty. When the kidney transplant is performed in the middle of the night, the surgeon may not be able to concentrate due to fatigue, which may be related to the better effect of the operation at the beginning of the day on weekends, but the overall results of transplantation on weekends and weekdays are the same [<a href=\"#pone.0287447.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>].</p><p>Early allograft failures attributed to vascular complications were more common in weekend transplants than in weekday transplants. Most failures caused by vascular complications occur within the first 7 days post-transplant, leading to short-term transplant failure and long-term reduced patient and graft survival rates. One reason is that the majority of post-kidney transplantation care is ward-based but remains predominantly led by senior medical or surgical reviews all days of the week, possibly shielding kidney allograft recipients from any weekend effect [<a href=\"#pone.0287447.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>]. In addition, there are the most experienced transplant team members who can access vascular imaging services in a timely manner, especially for patients with a large burden of vascular diseases involved in complex vascular/anastomotic transplantation. Nevertheless there are different service systems in different transplant centers, always there is some system of duty-on-call, allowing to coordinate the presence of licensed transplant surgeon during week-ends, to perform the procedure, effectively avoiding the occurrence of transplant complications. Transplantation doctors undergo specialized training and are more alert than regular surgeons. Therefore, they are very adept with technology and and treatment of complications, and there is little impact between the two groups in this regard.</p><p>However, our study also has limitations. First, only a few studies were included, and the limited sample size may have affected the results of the included studies. Second, confounding factors, such as differences in research time, technological innovation, and the contribution of resource limitations, have impact on research [<a href=\"#pone.0287447.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287447.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>]. Finally, the meta-analysis should be tested for a heterogeneity. If heterogeneity exists, it is best to analyze the causes of heterogeneity. We will follow up more relevant research, update data in time and report the latest research results.</p><p>Nevertheless, our study is meaningful. The results of a single-center study are independent. Meta-analysis combines the effects of these studies, which can better evaluate the impact of the two groups on renal transplantation.</p><p>In conclusion, the weekend effect of renal transplantation is very weak; thus, weekend and weekday transplantations are both appropriate.</p><h2>Supporting information</h2><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287447.s001\">S1 Fig. </a>Funnel plot of patient survival.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287447.s001\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287447.s001</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(TIF)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287447.s002\">S1 Table. </a>PRISMA 2020 main checklist and PRIMSA abstract checklist.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287447.s002\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287447.s002</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(DOCX)</p><h2>References</h2><h3>Subject Areas <div id=\"subjInfo\">?</div>\\n    <div id=\"subjInfoText\">\\n      <p>For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/PLOS/plos-thesaurus/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link opens in new window\">here</a>.</p>\\n      <span class=\"inline-intro\">We want your feedback.</span> Do these Subject Areas make sense for this article?

The objective is to investigate the impact of functional strength training on the physical capabilities of football players and to develop a machine learning-based approach for posture recognition. A total of 116 adolescents aged 8 to 13 participating in football training are randomly assigned to either an experimental group (n = 60) or a control group (n = 56). Both groups underwent 24 training sessions, with the experimental group engaging in 15–20 minutes of functional strength training after each session. Machine learning techniques, specifically the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) in deep learning, are utilized to analyze the kicking actions of football players. Movement speed, sensitivity, and strength are employed as input vectors for the BPNN to compare the images of players’ movements, while the similarity between the kicking actions and standard movements served as the output result to enhance training efficiency. The experimental group’s kicking scores are compared to their pre-experiment scores, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement. Moreover, statistically significant differences are observed in the 5*25m shuttle running, throwing, and set kicking between the control and experimental groups. These findings highlight the significant enhancement in strength and sensitivity achieved through functional strength training in football players. The results contribute to the development of training programs for football players and the overall improvement of training efficiency.</p><p><strong>Citation: </strong>Cao X, Zhao X, Tang H, Fan N, Zereg F (2023) Football players’ strength training method using image processing based on machine learning.

Introduction</h2><p>The popularity of competitive sports, particularly football, has grown in tandem with cultural and economic advancements [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. Modern football is characterized by its aggressive nature, high volume, intensity, extended duration, and demanding physical and technical requirements. To excel in this sport, football players must undergo rigorous training to optimize their physical fitness and adaptability [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>]. Physical fitness plays a crucial role in determining a player’s performance on the football field. However, Chinese football players tend to have lower overall physical fitness levels compared to their international counterparts [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>]. This discrepancy can be attributed to the absence of scientific training plans and the focus on technical aspects rather than physical attributes, which is more prevalent in Asian countries. The decline in youth fitness levels in China is a concerning trend, prompting the government to implement measures aimed at improving the health and fitness of the general population [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. It is important to tailor training approaches to different age groups. For example, children aged 7 to 9 should prioritize improving inter-muscular coordination through physical activities. Children aged 10 to 13 should focus on developing strength. Therefore, players require appropriate physical training methods to achieve maximum efficiency. Immersive glasses technology based on virtual reality has been developed by some researchers to enhance perception and improve athletes’ training outcomes [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. This technology integrates cutting-edge information technologies such as human-computer interaction and virtual reality, providing a more immersive training experience. Functional training has gained significant attention from researchers worldwide, who have conducted extensive studies to explore its scientific foundations and efficacy.</p><p>This paragraph compiles several studies examining the effects of functional training on the strength and performance of football players. A study focused on the high-intensity tactical training program employed by the United States Marine Corps, which shares similarities with high-intensity functional training, and its growing popularity among military personnel. The authors also assessed the benefits and drawbacks of high-intensity functional training for the military [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. A literature review has examined the effectiveness of high-intensity functional training in improving athletic performance [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. The findings indicated that untrained and amateur participants experienced positive outcomes in terms of aerobic capacity, anaerobic performance, and muscle endurance. However, there were no significant changes observed in muscle strength and power. Functional training’s impact on postmenopausal women was examined in a 16-week study, which revealed significant improvements in body composition, functional adaptation, and lipid profiles [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>]. Additionally, research has focused on the training of football players, considering the physical demands and tactics involved in the game, such as sprinting, stopping, turning, falling, jumping, and rushing. A study identified functional task deficits in soccer players experiencing chronic hip and groin pain [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>]. Machine learning has been applied to athlete motion analysis, with one study successfully using hidden Markov patterns to accurately recognize badminton strokes [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. This work highlighted the variations in acceleration among athletes executing identical stroke actions. Social network analysis combined with machine learning was employed to quantify individual player performance and team efficacy using football match data [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. Video tracking techniques, specifically kernel correlation filtering, effectively monitored football player physical performance with minimal tracking errors and maintained frame rates [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>]. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been utilized to identify table tennis strokes, achieving an accuracy range of 85.0% to 95.0% [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. Similarly, the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) algorithm successfully recognized different hand movements with an accuracy exceeding 95% [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. The BPNN combined with Kinect technology was also employed to recognize human actions, demonstrating accurate recognition capabilities based on learned action features [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>].</p><p>Despite the available research, there is a dearth of studies investigating the specific relationship between functional training and football players. Machine learning algorithms have demonstrated proficiency in recognizing human and athletic movements. While functional training has shown the potential to enhance athletes’ strength, there is a limited body of evidence specifically focused on the impact of functional training on the strength of football players. Furthermore, the imbalanced nature of sample data for feature extraction during changes in athletes’ actions presents a challenge in the recognition task. Further investigation is warranted in this area to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of functional training on the strength and performance of football players.</p><p>In this work, the movements of football players are identified using machine learning techniques to investigate the effectiveness of strength training in football. A total of 116 young participants aged 8 to 13, engaged in football team training, were randomly selected. Both groups undergo 24 training sessions, with the experimental group receiving an additional 15–20 minutes of functional strength training after each session. Machine learning algorithms are employed to recognize the distinct postures adopted by football players during training. Specifically, a BPNN is utilized to analyze the kicking motion of the players. By comparing images of the players’ movements using the BPNN, incorporating factors such as speed, sensitivity, and strength as input vectors, the output result measures the similarity between the players’ kicking action and the standard action. This approach aims to enhance training efficiency. Subsequently, the experimental scores of the kicking motions for both the experimental and control groups are compared against the standard movements. The findings of this work offer a valuable theoretical foundation for the development of training programs for football players, with the potential to enhance training efficiency and overall performance.</p><h2>2. Method</h2><h3>2.1 Research subject</h3><p>A total of 116 students within the age range of 8 to 13, who are actively engaged in football training, are selected as participants for this work. These students are randomly assigned to either the experimental group (consisting of 60 students) or the control group (comprising 56 students). Over the course of this work, both groups undergo a series of twenty-four training sessions, with each group following its own specific curriculum. Prior to participating in this work, the minors involve, along with their respective guardians, provided informed consent by signing a consent form, thereby indicating their willingness to take part in the experiment.</p><h3>2.2 Research methods</h3><h3>2.3 Content of functional strength training</h3><p>Functional strength training is a training approach that aims to improve the overall muscular contraction strength and efficiency of individuals, taking into account their specific characteristics and needs. Unlike traditional training methods that focus on isolated muscle development for specific movements, functional strength training emphasizes a balanced approach. It encompasses a range of exercises that target opposing movements such as pushing and pulling, as well as exercises that address different areas of the body, such as the hips and knees. The primary goal of functional strength training is to enhance the ability to engage a greater number of muscle fibers rather than solely focusing on muscle hypertrophy. This approach leverages the body’s elasticity to generate explosive power. By promoting the activation of multiple muscle groups and optimizing neural coordination, functional strength training contributes to the improvement of maximum strength and power output. The concept of functional training seeks to establish a standardized training method that can benefit athletes across various sports. It recognizes the importance of the body’s kinematic chain and aims to enhance overall coordination and functional performance. Through the incorporation of functional strength training, individuals can unlock their full potential and achieve improved physical capabilities in sports and other activities of daily life.</p><p>The functional strength training program utilized here includes the following exercises:</p><p>This exercise aims to target and strengthen the rectus abdominis and iliopsoas muscles. Participants lie on their backs, gripping a football with their feet to prevent it from rolling away. The exercise involves lifting the leg quickly and lowering it slowly while simultaneously lifting the hands and head off the ground. Each round consists of two sets, with each set comprising ten repetitions of leg lifts and drops.</p><p>This drill focuses on enhancing the hip flexors and iliopsoas muscles. Participants lie on their back with arms extended to the sides. They bend their knees to a 90-degree angle while gripping a solid ball between their knees. The exercise involves twisting the hips from left to right while maintaining steady breathing and engaging the abdominal muscles. Each participant performs two sets of 15 repetitions for each movement.</p><p>The aim of this exercise is to target multiple muscle groups, including the latissimus dorsi, erector spinae, gluteus maximus, deltoid muscle, rectus abdominis, and abdominal oblique muscles. Participants start in a prone position and bend their left elbow joint to support their body weight, while simultaneously raising their right arm forward. During the training, the participants straighten their left leg to support the ground and lift the front of their right foot. It is important to maintain steady breathing throughout the entire training process, keep the back tightened, and avoid any shaking of the raised arm and leg. Each set consists of 15 repetitions, and participants perform two sets of training.</p><p>The objective of this exercise is to target the hip muscles and quadriceps of the players. Participants begin by assuming a standing posture with their weight on the right foot, maintaining balance. They then extend the left leg backward, placing the right hand behind the ears. The exercise involves squatting down, touching the right foot with the left hand, and standing back up. It is crucial to avoid bending over during the squatting movement. Participants should perform two sets of training, with each set comprising 15 repetitions.</p><p>The purpose of this exercise is to target the players’ rectus abdominis and iliopsoas muscles. Participants lie on their backs with their feet clamped around a football to prevent it from dropping during training. Using the waist as the axis, they swing their legs from left to right, with their hands placed on both sides of the body to maintain balance. The upward swing should be swift, while the downward swing should be done leisurely. Each set consists of 10 repetitions, and participants perform two sets of training.</p><p>This exercise focuses on exercising the players’ rectus abdominis and iliopsoas muscles. Participants lie on their backs with their feet pinned to the football, lifting their legs, curling their abdominals, and raising their hands. They slightly raise their head and lift their legs straight off the ground. Each set comprises 15 repetitions, and participants perform two sets of training.</p><p>These exercises have been incorporated into the functional strength training program to specifically target and strengthen the rectus abdominis and iliopsoas muscles of the football players. Participants can enhance their core stability, abdominal strength, and overall lower body muscular endurance by including supine leg swinging and supine head leg crunches with feet clamping a football.</p><h3>2.4 Experimental teaching methods</h3><p>Over the course of one month, specifically from July 2019 to August 2019, the experimental group underwent regular training sessions from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. daily, while the control group attended scheduled classes from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. each day. Both groups implemented game-based learning strategies to ignite the students’ enthusiasm for football. The training primarily focused on application drills such as passing and dribbling, aiming to enhance the players’ skills in these areas.</p><p>Following each training session, the experimental group participated in 15–20 minutes of functional strength training. Throughout the entire project, three coaches were involved, ensuring the elimination of potential instructor bias. There were no changes made to the training aids used by either the experimental or control groups during the duration of this work.</p><p>Data were collected and analyzed using a machine learning-based posture identification technique, focusing on ten football players and their seven postures: inaction, walking, running, juggling, kicking, catching, and lifting the ball. Each motion was recorded fifty times, resulting in a total of 5000 samples. The participants assumed standard football positions based on their typical physical activity levels during the data collection process.</p><h3>2.5 Test indicator selection</h3><p>The indicators examined in this work encompassed the player’s speed, sensitivity, and strength. To assess speed, the 10-meter and 30-meter sprints were employed as performance measures. Sensitivity was evaluated using the Illinois agility test and the 5*25-meter shuttle run. Lastly, strength was evaluated through throws and set kicking drills, which provided a measure of the players’ overall strength capabilities.</p><h3>2.6 Football players’ posture recognition using machine learning</h3><p>Data on acceleration and angular velocity were collected from football players’ positions. <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287433.e001\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span>, <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287433.e002\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span>, and <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287433.e003\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span> represent the <em>n</em>-th sampling point’s acceleration on the <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em> axes. <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287433.e004\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span>, <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287433.e005\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span>, and <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287433.e006\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span> represent the <em>n</em>-th sampling point’s angular velocities on the <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em> axes. Eq (<a href=\"#pone.0287433.e007\">1</a>) shows the acceleration’s vector sum at the <em>n</em>-th point.</p><p>Similarly, Eq (<a href=\"#pone.0287433.e008\">2</a>) shows the angular velocity’s vector sum at the <em>n</em>-th point.</p><p>The data acquisition module captures three acceleration vectors and three angular velocity vectors. The vector sum of acceleration and angular velocity is computed using Eqs (<a href=\"#pone.0287433.e007\">1</a>) and (<a href=\"#pone.0287433.e008\">2</a>), resulting in a total of eight vectors. These eight vectors are then combined to form a single 8-dimensional feature matrix. During data collection, <em>N</em> sampling points are gathered, with each sample representing an <em>N</em>×8 feature matrix. The mean and variance are utilized as time-domain features for gesture recognition in football players. The following quotation presents the mean values for each sample point.</p><p>Eq (<a href=\"#pone.0287433.e010\">4</a>) shows each sample point’s variance.</p><p>The time-domain features extracted comprise a total of 16 dimensions of attitude parameters. These include:</p><p>Acceleration sensors: x-axis, y-axis, z-axis, and the mean value of the acceleration vector sum.</p><p>Angular velocity vector sensors: x-axis, y-axis, z-axis, and mean value of the angular velocity vector sum.</p><p>Acceleration sensors: x-axis, y-axis, z-axis, and variance of the acceleration vector sum.</p><p>Angular velocity vector sensors: x-axis, y-axis, z-axis, and variance of the angular velocity vector sum.</p><p>These 16 dimensions provide valuable information about the attitude and movement characteristics of football players.</p><p>Following feature extraction, a 32-dimensional feature parameter set is generated for football players’ posture recognition. However, to improve the recognition performance and efficiency of the classifier, it is important to filter out irrelevant or redundant feature parameters that are closely related to the football player’s hand gestures. This can be achieved by selecting relevant features to reduce the dimensionality of the data. In this work, the principal component analysis (PCA) method was employed for feature parameter selection after conducting experimental tests. PCA helps identify the most informative features and reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, thereby enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of football hand gesture recognition.</p><h3>2.7 Acquisition of ball-kicking data of players</h3><p>The deep learning (DL) method aligns with the concept of an artificial neural network (ANN), which serves as a machine learning architecture. The neural network, functioning as an algorithm, trains the weights connecting individual units within the network. Drawing inspiration from the workings of the human brain, ANN algorithms have the capacity to learn and adapt to new scenarios. In the human brain, input signals are received and processed through the nervous system, while external stimuli are sensed through neurons that convert electrical signals from nerve endings. DL-based neural networks are mathematical models that emulate the neural system of the human brain. These networks exhibit high fault tolerance, fast learning and self-adaptation rates, and the ability to approximate nonlinear functions. They can be effectively employed for tasks such as binary image recognition, prediction, and fuzzy control of binary images. The BPNN is an example of a three-layer feedforward neural network comprising the input, hidden, and output layers. The structure of the BPNN is illustrated in <a href=\"#pone-0287433-g001\">Fig 1</a>.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287433.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287433.g001</a></p><p>In the BPNN, each layer consists of n neurons, and there are connections between each layer. However, the neurons within a single layer are not interconnected. The BPNN algorithm involves two main processes: error backpropagation and forward information propagation [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. The detailed steps of these processes are depicted in <a href=\"#pone-0287433-g002\">Fig 2</a>.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287433.g002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287433.g002</a></p><p>In the forward propagation process, the input object is divided into n input vectors. The weight coefficient is denoted as “<em>w</em>” and the bias vector as “<em>b</em>”. The input vector “<em>x</em>” undergoes a linear operation, as shown in Eq (<a href=\"#pone.0287433.e011\">5</a>).</p><p>In Eq (<a href=\"#pone.0287433.e011\">5</a>), “<em>z</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>” represents the output of the <em>i</em>-th neuron. The network performs calculations layer by layer, starting from the input layer until reaching the output result. In BPNN, the sigmoid function is commonly used as the activation function for the neurons in the hidden layers to enhance the algorithm’s expressive ability. Eq (<a href=\"#pone.0287433.e012\">6</a>) represents the sigmoid function “<em>g</em>(<em>z</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>)”.</p><p>The domains of the mentioned functions are sets of real numbers, and their range is [0, 1]. After obtaining the outputs from all the hidden layers, the cross-entropy loss function is used to measure the discrepancy between the predicted values and the observed values, thus evaluating the predictive capability of the model. The loss function can be represented by Eq (<a href=\"#pone.0287433.e013\">7</a>).</p><p>In Eq (<a href=\"#pone.0287433.e013\">7</a>), the variable <em>y</em> stands for the actual output.</p><p>During the error backpropagation process, the gradient of the loss function is propagated backward from the output layer to the hidden layer, and the loss value is distributed to each layer of neurons. Through continuous iteration, the parameters between layers are updated to minimize the error between the actual output and the expected output values. This procedure enhances the robustness of the BPNN by adjusting the weights and thresholds associated with the smallest error [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]. According to the gradient descent method based on the loss function, the largest gradient descent occurs along the backpropagation process.</p><p>In Eqs (<a href=\"#pone.0287433.e014\">8</a>) and (<a href=\"#pone.0287433.e015\">9</a>), <em>w</em><sub><em>i</em>+1</sub> represents the updated weight coefficient, <em>w</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> refers to the current weight coefficient, <em>lr</em> signifies the learning rate for each iteration, and ∇ represents the gradient of the loss function.</p><p>The selection of the number of nodes in the hidden layer is a challenging aspect of feature layer fusion based on BPNN. Currently, there is no standardized method for determining the number of nodes in the hidden layer, which directly affects the overall performance of the network. Therefore, careful consideration must be given to the selection of hidden layer nodes [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>]. The concept of a “suitable amount” should be applied when choosing the number of hidden layer nodes. Having an excessive number of nodes in the BPNN may lead to longer training times and may not achieve the desired learning outcome. On the other hand, having too few nodes results in an overly simplistic BPNN structure with lower recognition accuracy, robustness, and interference resistance [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>]. The number of hidden layers can be determined using Eq (<a href=\"#pone.0287433.e016\">10</a>).</p><p>In Eq (<a href=\"#pone.0287433.e016\">10</a>), <em>N</em><sub><em>h</em></sub> stands for the desired number of hidden layer nodes, <em>N</em><sub><em>1</em></sub> signifies the number of input nodes, <em>N</em><sub><em>0</em></sub> represents the number of output nodes, and <em>L</em> refers to an integer between 1 and 10. Based on practical training experience, <em>L</em> is typically chosen as a large value, generally greater than half of the sum of the input and output nodes.</p><p>For this work, a dataset was collected by inviting twenty male football players who had different heights and weights to perform kicking actions. Among the players, one player stood out as being taller than the rest, and his kicking action data was used as the standard action. High-speed cameras were utilized to capture the kicking action data, with a frame rate of 25fps and a resolution of 1024×1280. The BPNN algorithm was employed to analyze the similarity between the kicking actions of young players and the standard action, providing valuable insights for their football training.</p><h3>2.8 Evaluation criteria for similarity of image features</h3><p>The calculation of image feature similarity plays a crucial role in the accuracy of subsequent image retrieval. Different similarity measurement functions can yield diverse image retrieval results. In this work, the following similarity measurement function is utilized:</p><p>In Eq (<a href=\"#pone.0287433.e017\">11</a>), <em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> and <em>y</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> represent the feature vectors of image <em>x</em> and image <em>y</em>, respectively, and <em>n</em> represents the dimension of the image feature vector.</p><p>In football players’ joint point detection, a CNN is used to convolve the input images and generate confidence maps, also known as hot spot maps, for detecting the joint points. Multi-stage learning is employed, where each stage refines the learning and detection results of the previous stage, aiming to bring the final results closer to the target values. Let <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287433.e019\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span> represent the confidence map of the <em>k</em>-th athlete, and <em>x</em><sub><em>jk</em></sub> denote the actual value of the <em>j</em>-th joint point for this athlete. The predicted value at point <em>P</em> can be expressed using the following Gaussian function:\\n<a name=\"pone.0287433.e020\" id=\"pone.0287433.e020\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287433.e020\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(13)</span></span></p><p>After detecting the joint points, it is necessary to connect them to form a complete human body model. However, if the connection is solely based on the confidence of the detection points, errors may occur when multiple points are involved. A local affinity domain method incorporates limb direction information into the predictions to address this issue, generating a two-dimensional (2D) vector code. Typically, the human body model can be represented as a simple connection of multiple joint points. After polynomial fitting of the body joint points in the x-axis and y-axis directions, the coefficients of the polynomial fitting are used as features for data analysis. PCA is then applied to perform data dimension reduction. PCA aims to reduce the dimensionality of the data by utilizing the eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix. It constructs an orthogonal transformation that minimizes the mean square error (MSE). Through this transformation, the characteristics of the samples are decomposed into orthogonal components, revealing the fundamental components of the data information.</p><p>In the data training phase, several steps are followed to prepare the data for classification using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). First, the average of the training data samples is calculated, and this average is subtracted from each training data point. Next, the covariance matrix and eigenvalues are computed. The dimension of the matrix is then reduced based on the contribution rate of the calculated eigenvectors. This reduction helps to eliminate redundant or less informative dimensions. Finally, the final training data is obtained by multiplying the difference between each training sample and the average data by the dimensionality reduction matrix. During the data testing phase, a similar process is applied. The average of the training data is subtracted from each testing data point, and the resulting difference is multiplied by the dimensionality reduction matrix.</p><p>Once the data is prepared, it is fed into SVMs for classification and action recognition. SVMs are capable of handling nonlinear problems by using a kernel function to map the data into a higher-dimensional feature space (Hilbert space) where the problem becomes linearly separable. In this case, the Gaussian kernel function is typically used to transform the feature space, allowing the SVM training model to successfully recognize different actions.</p><h3>2.9 Statistical methods</h3><p>This work utilizes the Berkeley Multi-Channel Human Action Detection (MHAD) dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the BPNN algorithm for action recognition. The MHAD dataset includes reference background and depth images, which are used to extract the first-layer feature vectors. The dataset consists of 11 different movements performed by a group of seven men and five women. Each movement is repeated five times, resulting in a total of 660 action sequences. The recording duration for the dataset is approximately 82 minutes. This dataset provides a valuable resource for training and evaluating the BPNN algorithm’s performance in action recognition tasks.</p><p>The player training data is analyzed using IBM’s statistical software SPSS 26.0 (Statistical Product and Service Solutions 26.0), developed by IBM Corporation in New York, USA. In the analysis of the players’ basic situation, the data were presented using a percentile system. A single-factor analysis was conducted to examine the differences between different situations. In statistical analysis, a commonly used threshold for determining statistical significance is a p-value of less than 0.05. If the calculated p-value is less than 0.05, it indicates that the observed difference between the groups is statistically significant. In other words, there is a significant difference between the situations being compared.</p><h2>3. Results</h2><p>This section presents a comprehensive analysis of experiments conducted to validate the effectiveness of image processing technology based on DL in guiding football players during functional strength training. Each experiment result is thoroughly examined and discussed. The following subsections provide a clear overview of the findings:</p><p>Section 3.1 presents the accuracy results of the BPNN algorithm for recognizing single movements in the MHAD dataset.</p><p>Section 3.2 analyzes the statistical differences between the experimental and control football players in terms of movement speed, sensitivity, and strength test metrics. The focus is on highlighting the improvements observed in each testing metric within the experimental group.</p><p>Section 3.3 compares the performance of the experimental and control football players in 10-meter sprints, 30-meter sprints, and fixed-point kicks.

It is essential to assess data quality by examining the efficiency of records with varying lengths since data quality is directly related to the length of the record. Actions with longer recordings, such as “sit and stand” or “bend to raise hand” in the MHAD dataset, exhibit better performance compared to actions with shorter recordings. It is worth noting that the performance of the BPNN technique can be significantly enhanced by increasing the utilization of unlabeled data as input to the deep network. This characteristic makes the algorithm well-suited for practical applications where unlabeled data is abundant.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287433.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287433.t001</a></p><p>During the collection of sport posture data, participants perform specific football actions based on their exercise habits.

Discussion</h2><p>The declining physical fitness of football players is a concerning trend in the current landscape. In light of this, the present work aims to investigate the impact of functional strength training on the physical capabilities of football players. By exploring the relationship between functional strength training and the physical fitness of football players, this research seeks to shed light on potential strategies for improving and maintaining their physical performance levels.</p><p>The experimental findings provide evidence that functional strength training is effective in enhancing the strength and sensitivity of football players. The observed improvements in strength can be attributed to the training’s ability to target and strengthen the players’ core muscles. Functional strength training stimulates the core muscles, particularly when there are imbalances in other body parts, resulting in improved utilization of athletic abilities and increased core strength during exercises. This, in turn, contributes to improved overall performance. However, the immediate impact on speed is not as evident. This could be due to the fact that speed performance improvement is closely tied to specific speed training, which may not have been explicitly included in the functional strength training program. Both the experimental and control groups likely had similar speed training components, resulting in comparable speed outcomes after the experiment. It is worth noting that the athletes may have already possessed a higher level of speed quality prior to the experiment, which could explain the lack of significant differences in speed improvement between the two groups. Previous research has examined the effects of functional strength training in various contexts. For example, a study focusing on weightlifters aimed to improve snatch performance through functional strength (strength-strength-balance) training [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>]. The results showed a statistically significant improvement in both training and snatch performance. This supports the notion that functional strength training can positively impact specific athletic performance. Researchers have investigated the impact of periodic functional strength training on the functional movement screening (FMS) scores of high-risk sports college students [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>]. Their findings revealed a significant improvement in the total FMS score in the experimental group after 12 weeks of following the functional strength training program (P &lt; 0.05). Specifically, 45% of the volunteers who initially scored 14 on the FMS showed notable progress. These results align with previous studies, highlighting the superior effectiveness of functional strength training. Additionally, another study examined the effects of functional strength training on postural balance, gait, and functional strength in mentally-retarded teenagers [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>]. The experimental group demonstrated a statistically significant increase (P &lt; 0.05) in postural balance and muscle strength compared to the baseline, while the control group did not exhibit a similar improvement. Furthermore, a literature source recommended intelligent and personalized training that can be specifically tailored to individual training objectives [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>]. Consequently, functional strength training has the potential to enhance participants’ strength in their core muscle groups, leading to improvements in strength, sensitivity, and balance.</p><p>In this work, the focus is on the analysis of kicking actions in football players. The analysis of football movement serves as a training aid, providing timely feedback to players when their kicking action deviates from the desired technique. Functional strength training has been a subject of investigation in relation to its impact on the effectiveness of football practice sessions. Previous research has explored the efficacy of functional strength training in injury prevention for adult male football players. The research has also examined the actual outcomes of implementing functional strength training when teaching football skills. The results have consistently demonstrated that functional strength training methods effectively enhance athletes’ abilities and performance, supporting its application in football training [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>]. Additionally, academics have investigated the training and competition cycles of youth football players and highlighted the role of functional training in their physical preparation process. The integration of functional training into the workout plans of young athletes has been shown to be beneficial, enhancing their overall training outcomes [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>]. The effects of functional training on lower limb strength in football players have also been explored in the literature. The findings indicate that functional training can improve lower limb strength and explosive power in football players. This underscores the importance of incorporating functional training into the physical training programs of football players, as it has the potential to contribute to their overall performance on the field [<a href=\"#pone.0287433.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>]. The current study aligns with previous research, further supporting the notion that functional strength training can enhance athletes’ performance in the gym. The incorporation of functional training methods can significantly improve practice efficiency for adolescent football players, providing them with valuable tools to optimize their training and performance outcomes. By highlighting the existing literature and reinforcing the findings through this work, the benefits of functional strength training in the context of football training are further emphasized. This work conducted in this work contributes to the growing body of knowledge on functional training and its implications for football players, ultimately enhancing their overall athletic performance.</p><p>This article investigates the relationship between functional strength training and physical ability in soccer players. However, it is critical to acknowledge the limitations of this work, including the exclusion of speed training and the lack of clear conclusions regarding speed performance. Therefore, future research should consider incorporating speed training and expanding the sample size to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the developed program’s impact on improving the physical fitness of soccer players.</p><h2>5. Conclusion</h2><p>This work aims to investigate the relationship between functional strength training and speed and power in football players. The results indicate that functional strength training effectively increases strength and sensitivity in football players. However, this work did not find a significant correlation between functional strength training and players’ speed. These findings provide a theoretical basis for improving training methods and efficiency in teenage football players. However, there are limitations to consider. The small sample size used in this work may introduce potential biases and chance factors. Future research should expand the sample size to ensure more accurate results. Additionally, further investigation is needed to examine the impact of functional strength training on speed quality in football players. Exploring the link between motions and skills would also contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.</p><h2>Supporting information</h2><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287433.s001\">S1 Data. </a></h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287433.s001\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287433.s001</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(XLSX)</p><h2>References</h2><h3>Subject Areas <div id=\"subjInfo\">?</div>\\n    <div id=\"subjInfoText\">\\n      <p>For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/PLOS/plos-thesaurus/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link opens in new window\">here</a>.</p>\\n      <span class=\"inline-intro\">We want your feedback.</span> Do these Subject Areas make sense for this article?

At the start of the pandemic, many healthcare workers cared for critically ill patients, creating long work hours and work stress for themselves and their immediate family due to increased exposure and risk of contracting the SARS CoV2 virus which causes COVID- 19 [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. The COVID-19 pandemic also created a shift in personal and home responsibilities, particularly among those with children and elderly persons in the home whose typical care or activities were disrupted. Thus, essential healthcare workers were placed in situations which necessitated high-stress vocational work and unique stresses in dependent care [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. As a result, sections of the healthcare workforce experienced a worker exodus at the onset and throughout the pandemic [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. Furthermore, healthcare workers continue to leave, leading to major projected shortages in the healthcare field in the months and years to come [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>].</p><p>Intention to leave one’s job refers to a person’s thoughts related to job separation and is considered a proxy predictor of voluntary turnover among workers [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>]. Causes for turnover among healthcare workers include control of one’s schedule, job satisfaction [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>], work environment [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>], and burnout or emotional exhaustion [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. Few studies have examined gender differences related to work-life balance and home-duties among healthcare workers [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. In a 2018 study, Ly et al. reported that married female physicians with children spent significantly more time daily on household activities and childcare duties than their male counterparts [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, several studies highlighted gender differences in job productivity and promotion in medical academia, most of which were attributed to the unequal distribution of additional home and childcare duties in the midst of school and daycare closures [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>].While several studies examined the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and healthcare worker attrition, few have examined the impact of gender on intention to leave and among multiple roles within healthcare [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>].</p><p>Smaller studies report that some groups seemed to be leaving healthcare at disproportionate rates, including females and nurses. We sought to understand these patterns and address the knowledge gap related to the longitudinal effects of the pandemic on the workforce. The use of a large, national registry such as the Healthcare Worker Exposure Response and Outcomes (HERO) registry permits further investigation of these relationships in the setting of the COVID pandemic.</p><p>Our aim was to evaluate whether female healthcare workers would be more likely than male healthcare workers to report intention to leave or change healthcare fields in the HERO registry, a large national registry that captures healthcare worker experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. We further sought to understand the experience of burnout and moral injury in those who expressed intent to leave.</p><h2>Methods</h2><h3>Data sources, study design and population</h3><p>The HERO Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04342806) was approved by the WIRB-Copernicus Group Institutional Review Board (WCG IRB). All participants provided written informed consent to participate in the registry. This manuscript was prepared according to the STROBE guidelines for observational studies. Details on governance, recruitment and data collection have been described previously [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>].</p><p>In brief, participant recruitment was conducted nationally, in collaboration with PCORnet®, the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network, and involved institution-wide emails from participating sites, print advertisements, social media advertisements, newsletters, and professional society solicitations. Participants completed informed consent and self-enrolled in the study online. The Registry population represents a convenience sample predominantly composed of adult healthcare workers, although community members were also eligible to enroll in the HERO registry. After the baseline data collection of COVID-19 exposure and experiences in May 2020, there were two additional HERO hot topic survey waves which were included in this analysis which occurred in May 2021 and December, 2021. ‘Hot topic’ surveys were administered for several months to ascertain the opinion of registry participants regarding timely topics related to COVID-19 (e.g., moral injury, vaccine willingness). Unique participants were included if they responded to the baseline surveys and at least one of the hot topic survey waves. All data collected in the study are participant-reported data [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>]. Data for this study was collected up through December 2021, analyzed in the summer of 2022, and submitted for publication in fall 2022.</p><h3>Primary exposure and outcome variables</h3><p>The primary exposure of interest was self-reported gender captured during the baseline assessment (male, female). There were 23 participants who identified as transgender/gender expansive (14), not listed (3), or missing/prefer not to answer (6), and these participants were excluded from the final analyses. In the HERO hot topic waves, participants were asked “As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, have you thought about leaving healthcare?” Response outcomes included: (0) No I have not thought about leaving; (1) I have thought about but not actively planning to leave healthcare; (2) I have thought about but not actively planning to change my field or area of healthcare; (3) I have already left the healthcare field; (4) I have already changed my field or area of healthcare; (5) I am actively making plans to leave the healthcare field; (6) I am actively making plans to change my field or area of healthcare.</p><p>The outcome variable was categorized as a binary outcome where “intention to leave/left” = yes for all participants with a response of 1–6 (those who had left, thinking about leaving or were actively planning to leave healthcare or their field or area of healthcare versus no intention to leave). In a sensitivity analysis, we created an alternative outcome dichotomizing “intention to leave” as those who had left or were actively planning to leave healthcare or their field or area of healthcare versus those with no intention to leave or thinking about leaving but not actively planning (options 3–6 above).</p><p>In both the May and December 2021 HERO hot topic surveys, participants who reported any intention to leave were asked about possible contributors, including burnout and moral injury. The item asked, “What factors have contributed to your thoughts about leaving or changing your field/area in healthcare (select all that apply)?” Response options included: Job-related burnout; Job-related moral injury; Concerns about infection; Financial stressors; Family reasons; Availability of other professional opportunities. Burnout was defined as “a state of physical or emotional exhaustion as a result of chronic workplace stress.” Moral injury was defined as “a state of psychological distress as a result of acting or witnessing behaviors that go against your values and/or moral beliefs.”</p><h3>Covariates</h3><p>Baseline covariates included age group of respondent in years (18–29, 30–49, 50–64, 65+); race/ ethnicity (White, Black/African-American, Hispanic/Latino, Asian/Pacific Islander, Other/mixed/prefer not to answer); region of the country (Northeast, Midwest, South, West); Healthcare worker role (Independent providers (Physician, Physician assistant, Nurse practitioner); Nurse (Registered Nurse or Licensed Practical Nurse); Emergency Worker (Paramedic/EMS); Ancillary clinical workers (Other Practitioners, Tech/Support and Other healthcare workers); Non clinical (Administrators or Research worker) and survey wave (May or December). Other covariates included family composition (adults, children, senior; 3 levels: yes/no/missing), healthcare facility type, healthcare location within facility (high infection risk unit, other unit, technical clinical service, non-clinical service, other) and weekly work hours (“before pandemic” and “in the past week”).</p><h3>Statistical analysis</h3><p>Descriptive statistics included the medians, ranges and proportions for each gender. Baseline characteristics and study outcomes used Chi-square test of proportions for univariate comparisons. We tested the proportional odds assumption to allow for the outcome to be analyzed ordinally. The outcome was non proportional between levels and the assumptions were not met. Thus, the primary analysis dichotomized the responses into a binary outcome as delineated above. Multivariable logistic regression modeled the primary outcome, intention to leave or change fields, by gender adjusting for the above covariates of age, race/ethnicity, healthcare worker role, survey wave, family composition, self-reported caretaker status, healthcare facility, healthcare location, and weekly work hours. We tested for effect measure modification between gender and healthcare worker role; test for an interaction was not statistically significant for the primary (p = 0.489) or the sensitivity ITL endpoints (p = 0.152) and these were not included in the models. Participants who answered the survey in both May and Dec contributed repeated measures, with the primary outcome measured separately at each time point. Multiple responses within the same participant were addressed in the models using GEE (with exchangeable working correlation matrix).</p><p>We did multiple exploratory analyses. Among those who reported intention to leave, we evaluated the proportions of burnout and moral injury by gender and across gradations of intent to leave (left or active planning versus thoughts but no active planning). Additionally, we determined if caregiver status (Caregiver defined as responding “Yes” to question: “Do you routinely look after a child or a sick, elderly, or disable person as caregiver?”) was associated with intention to leave. Adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) are reported.</p><h2>Results</h2><h3>Sample selection and characteristics</h3><p>Overall, there were 3320 respondents to both the baseline and one of the two hot topic waves (May or December 2021), of which 641 (19.3%) were male and 2679 (80.7%) were female (<strong><a href=\"#pone-0287428-g001\">Fig 1</a></strong>). The May 2021 survey included 2584 respondents (503 male, 2081 female) and the December 2021 survey included 1581 respondents (327 male, 1254 female). There were 845 participants who completed both the May and the December 2021 surveys, of which 189 were male and 656 were female. The median age of all respondents from either survey was 42.0 years (Interquartile range [IQR] 34, 52 years). The majority of respondents self-identified as white (81.9%). The distribution of respondents’ residence by United States geographic region was 23.3% Northeast, 23.5% Midwest, 41.2% South, and 12.0% West. Among respondents’ healthcare role 35.7% vs 17.4% of males and females identified as independent clinical providers (physician or advanced practice provider). There were 11.5% versus 32.6% males and females identified as nurses. Prior to the pandemic 72.5% of male vs 56.4% of female respondents reported working 40+ hours per week. Almost 10% of females reported being a caretaker of a dependent including children or elderly adults (<strong><a href=\"#pone-0287428-t001\">Table 1</a></strong>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287428.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287428.g001</a></p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287428.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287428.t001</a></p><h3>Primary outcome: Intention to leave</h3><p>Among the 4165 responses to either the May and December surveys, 1169/2584 (45.2%; May respondents) and 896/1581 (56.7%; December respondents) indicated they were thinking about, making plans, or had left their position or healthcare. Among the 4165 responses to either May or December surveys, female gender was associated with increased odds of intention to leave (42.2% males versus 51.4% females reported intent to leave; aOR 1.36 [1.13, 1.63]). Adjusted odds of intention to leave were higher among December responses compared with May responses (aOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.56, 1.94). Nurses had higher odds of intention to leave compared to administrative or research staff, who were the reference standard (aOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.37, 2.20) (<strong><a href=\"#pone-0287428-t002\">Table 2</a> and <a href=\"#pone-0287428-g002\">Fig 2</a></strong>). Results of the mixed effects model that used an unstructured covariance structure were similar.

Results were consistent with the main results, but confidence intervals were wider (<strong><a href=\"#pone-0287428-t002\">Table 2</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"#pone-0287428-g002\">Fig 2</a></strong>).</p><h3>Evaluation of burnout and moral injury</h3><p>In the May survey, 76% of female compared with 69% of male respondents who expressed intention to leave had reported burnout as a contributor. In the December survey, 75% females compared with 71% for males who expressed intention to leave reported burnout. Among those who expressed intention to leave, one third of participants reported experience of moral injury, with similar levels reported by females and males (May: 35% in female, 34% in male; Dec: 33% in both female and male). Higher proportions of burnout and job-related moral injury were seen in the groups with intention to leave but no active plans compared to those who had already left or were actively planning to leave (<strong><a href=\"#pone-0287428-t003\">Table 3</a></strong>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287428.t003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287428.t003</a></p><h3>Exploratory analysis</h3><p>We conducted a univariate analysis which included caregiver status and healthcare worker role on intention to leave. In this model, we found that nurses were significantly associated with intention to leave as compared to physicians/PA/NP on both the primary and secondary intention to leave endpoints. Caregiver status was not significantly associated with intention to leave at either endpoint.</p><h2>Discussion</h2><p>In this study of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, we found that female gender was associated with a 36% higher odds of intention to leave compared with their male counterparts. We also report that compared to other provider types; nurses had 74% higher odds of intent to leave compared to most other health professionals. Respondents of both genders reported job-related burnout, with higher levels of burnout and moral injury reported in women compared to men. Those who had intention to leave but not made plans to do so reported the higher proportion of burnout and moral injury, compared to those who had already made plans or left, indicating low control of their work/job situation.</p><p>Our study is similar to other studies that explore the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and healthcare worker attrition, but advances what is known in that few have examined the impact of gender on intention to leave among a geographically diverse population and across multiple roles within the healthcare field [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>]. Our study advances what is known about intention to leave healthcare among a geographically diverse population and across multiple roles within the healthcare field. Few if any other studies have utilized a national registry such as the HERO registry to examine these relationships and therefore are potentially less generalizable. Our study is similar to other studies that explore the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and healthcare worker attrition, but advances what is known in that few have examined the impact of gender on intention to leave among a geographically diverse population, in a longitudinal fashion and across multiple roles within the healthcare field [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>].</p><p>Delaney et al. reported in a single U.S. health system that women and caregivers were more likely to consider leaving the healthcare workforce or reducing their working hours secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. We build on these findings, by reporting similar results across multiple healthcare systems and across varied healthcare worker roles. Waqas et al. conducted an online survey of 197 U.S. dermatologists in 2020 and reported that there was a greater impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on females compared to males in terms of ability to work, particularly with respect to childcare duties for those respondents with children. The Waqas study did not assess for intention to leave the field but rather an intention to modify work hours due to the pandemic. There are a few small international studies that examined intent to leave healthcare among diverse groups of healthcare workers but none were powered to adequately examine the impact of a specific job-role, such as nurses versus other provider types, on intention to leave [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>]. Our study advances the literature by providing comparison among different healthcare worker roles and intention to leave.</p><p>Other studies have examined burnout among clinicians, and even prior to the pandemic, burnout rates were typically found to be higher in females as compared to males [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>]. Other studies have examined the relationship of burnout, moral injury and intention to leave healthcare in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>]. LeClaire et al. found that nurses were disproportionately impacted by burnout and moral injury as compared to physicians, and that those clinicians experiencing burnout had a two to four-fold greater odds of intention to leave their healthcare jobs [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>]. Our analysis builds on these prior studies by allowing further examination of the layers of intention to leave or change healthcare roles beyond a binary analysis of intention to leave versus no intention to leave. We found that the highest proportions of burnout and moral injury were among those groups who had intention to leave but no active plans to do so. This is perhaps due to further distress which could result from feelings of lack of control over one’s work situation and/or inability to make a change in job despite burnout and/or moral distress.</p><p>This study is limited in part by the study’s sample selection, which was composed of individuals who registered to participate in the HERO registry. While all 50 states and the District of Columbia are represented, this sample should be considered a convenience sample and not necessarily nationally representative, as participants were recruited in large part from academic medical centers which are part of the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet). As noted in a prior HERO registry publication, our sample nonetheless had demographic features consistent with the CDC’s April 2020 report on more than 9000 healthcare workers infected with COVID-19 [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>]. Due to the nature of distribution of the survey, a response rate cannot be calculated, but studies of providers typically report a response rate of approximately 20% [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>]. Since the HERO registry was voluntary, we assume that our response rate is at least 20%. Additionally, the baseline survey did not ask participants about their baseline intention to leave. Data collected before the COVID-19 pandemic reported that among physicians, intention to leave is approximately 20–30% [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>]. Additionally, given that our data was collected in 2021 and noting that the overall percentage of respondents identifying themselves as caregivers was relatively low, it is possible that caregivers of young or elderly dependents had already left the healthcare workforce by the time that our data was collected.</p><p>Additionally, the questionnaire did not adequately capture the degree to which multiple stressors may have played a role in respondents’ consideration of intention to leave. Many factors may contribute to intention to leave or change their healthcare field for females including: promotion inequality, unequal pay, and other factors including caregiving during a pandemic. Important variables such as ages of the children in the household was not available and may be in the causal pathway between female gender and intention to leave healthcare. Prior studies have shown that females, particularly those married with children, bear the majority of home and childcare-related responsibilities [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>]. We note that the majority of respondents were female, which is a limitation for conducting analyses which explore gender-differences. However, according to most recent U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the majority of healthcare workers are female, and additionally, the majority of respondents in survey-based studies are also female [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>]. Thus, our sample is considered representative. Nonetheless, the predominantly female respondent base of our study is a limitation to what we can infer about male workers and their intention to leave healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, there were a small number of participants who answered both the May survey and December survey, which limits our ability to make inferences about longitudinal trends over the course of 2021.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that among this geographically and vocationally diverse group of healthcare workers, women had a higher odds of intending to leave or change their healthcare field than men and also had higher self-reported burnout and moral injury, which may be important contributors to their intent to leave. Further research is needed to understand the degree to which family-related stressors play a role in intention to leave, particularly in the context of a global pandemic. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the healthcare system remains under stress. The downstream impact of the exodus of healthcare workers from the workforce is still being realized. In particular, there continue to be nursing shortages filled by an increase in the numbers of traveling nurses [<a href=\"#pone.0287428.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>]. Traveling nurses, while filling these important gaps in patient care, demand higher salaries (leading to health system financial strain) and may have less input and investment into a health systems organizational culture. The downstream ramifications of these and other changes within the healthcare workforce remain areas in need of ongoing research.</p><h2>References</h2><h3>Subject Areas <div id=\"subjInfo\">?</div>\\n    <div id=\"subjInfoText\">\\n      <p>For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/PLOS/plos-thesaurus/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link opens in new window\">here</a>.</p>\\n      <span class=\"inline-intro\">We want your feedback.</span> Do these Subject Areas make sense for this article?

Several Lso haplotypes have been identified. Among the seven haplotypes present in North America, LsoA and LsoB are transmitted by the potato psyllid, <em>Bactericera cockerelli</em> (Šulc), in a circulative and persistent manner. The gut, which is the first organ pathogen encounters, could be a barrier for Lso transmission. However, the molecular interactions between Lso and the psyllid vector at the gut interface remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the global transcriptional responses of the adult psyllid gut upon infection with two Lso haplotypes (LsoA and LsoB) using Illumina sequencing. The results showed that each haplotype triggers a unique transcriptional response, with most of the distinct genes elicited by the highly virulent LsoB. The differentially expressed genes were mainly associated with digestion and metabolism, stress response, immunity, detoxification as well as cell proliferation and epithelium renewal. Importantly, distinct immune pathways were triggered by LsoA and LsoB in the gut of the potato psyllid. The information in this study will provide an understanding of the molecular basis of the interactions between the potato psyllid gut and Lso, which may lead to the discovery of novel molecular targets for the control of these pathogens.</p><p><strong>Citation: </strong>Tang X-T, Levy J, Tamborindeguy C (2023) Potato psyllids mount distinct gut responses against two different ‘<em>Candidatus</em> Liberibacter solanacearum’ haplotypes.

Presently, at least 14 Lso haplotypes have been identified [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>]. The haplotypes are transmitted by several psyllid species, and they infect different plants; some of which are important crops.</p><p>Haplotypes LsoA and LsoB are vectored by the potato psyllid (also known as the tomato psyllid), <em>Bactericera cockerelli</em> Šulc (Hemiptera: Triozidae) and infect solanaceous crops and wild plants. Specifically, both haplotypes are associated with potato zebra chip disease, which has been responsible for millions of dollars of losses in potato-producing regions of the United States, Mexico, Central America, and New Zealand [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. They also affect the production of other important solanaceous crops such as tomato [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>]. Difference in virulence between these two haplotypes was found in association with their host plants and their insect vector: in both cases LsoB was more pathogenic [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. Currently, the most dominant control strategy available for the diseases associated with this pathogen is based on monitoring and managing psyllid populations by regular pesticide applications in an effort to limit the spread of Lso. However, frequent chemical applications negatively impact the environment and human health and contribute to the development of resistance in vector populations [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>].</p><p>Disrupting the transmission cycle of pathogens within the insect vector is a novel and effective approach to control diseases. Lso is transmitted in a circulative and persistent manner by the potato psyllid [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>]. Once ingested, Lso moves through the psyllid, from the gut lumen into the hemocoel and circulates to the salivary glands, from where it is disseminated to new host plants during psyllid feeding. Therefore, the gut represents the first significant barrier for the transmission of Lso by the psyllid after its ingestion. Indeed, the ability of Lso to infect the gut or to cross from the alimentary canal into the hemocoel could determine its transmission efficiency [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>]. Thus, disruption of this process could be an effective way to control the spread of this pathogen.</p><p>Despite our adequate understanding of the invasion route of Lso within the potato psyllid, the mechanisms underpinning the transmission process remain largely unknown. In a previous analysis of LsoA and LsoB transmission, we determined that the titer of LsoB increases faster in the gut of adult psyllids than LsoA and that significantly higher LsoB titers were measured between 4 and 12 days of acquisition access period (AAP). Further, this difference in the acquisition was linked with a difference in transmission efficiency: 30 days after a 7-day AAP 90% of the test plants were positive for LsoB, while only 30% of the test plants were positive for LsoA [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>]. In addition, the rates of Lso transmission also depend upon potato psyllid haplotypes, even with the same Lso haplotype [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>].</p><p>Transcriptome analysis is a powerful methodology to quantify global gene expression patterns in various contexts from a single cell to whole tissues. Our earlier transcriptome studies analyzed the potato psyllid’s responses to Lso at the whole-body level, where an abundance of genes such as vitellogenin and heat shock proteins were differentially expressed [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>]. That analysis also revealed that immune genes commonly induced in response to Gram-negative bacteria in other insects were absent [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>]. Similar results were found in the Asian citrus psyllid, which is known to transmit a related Liberibacter species [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>]. In addition, Ghosh et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>] found genes from the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) and the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways overexpressed in the gut of carrot psyllid <em>B</em>. <em>trigonica</em> after infection with Lso haplotype D. Although the above studies have contributed to our understanding of the molecular basis of the interactions between Lso and its insect vectors, the transcriptional responses of the potato psyllid gut to the infection with LsoA and LsoB have not been evaluated. Considering our previous results that identified differences in the acquisition of these two haplotypes [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>], evaluating the gut responses to each haplotype could be key to determine the molecular mechanisms involved in Lso acquisition. In turn, candidate genes to disrupt transmission could be identified.</p><p>Here, we took advantage of the existence of two bacterial haplotypes with different pathogenicity to identify key components involved in the gut responses to Lso based on transcriptome analyses. We compared the gut transcriptomes of potato psyllids after feeding on LsoA- or LsoB-infected tomato plants for 2 and 7 days, which correspond to early and late gut colonization times, respectively [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>]. Our two objectives were to: (1) compare the psyllid gut responses to two Lso haplotypes—LsoA and LsoB—to identify the similarities and differences between these responses, and (2) provide insights into how the potato psyllid gut responds in a temporal manner to LsoA or LsoB. This study will contribute to the knowledge of the mechanisms underpinning the interactions between the potato psyllid and Lso at the gut interface, which can serve as a basis for developing new strategies to control vector-borne diseases based on pathogen transmission disruption.</p><h2>Materials and methods</h2><p>All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.</p><h3>Insects and plants</h3><p>Moneymaker tomato plants were grown from seed (Victory Seed Company, Molalla, OR). The psyllid colonies (western haplotype) were maintained on tomato plants at room temperature 24 ± 1°C and photoperiod of 16: 8 h (L: D) in insect cages (24 × 13.5 × 13.5 cm, BioQuip, Compton, CA). LsoA- and LsoB-infected tomato plants were obtained by allowing psyllids from the LsoA- or LsoB-infected colonies to feed for one week on 6-week-old tomato plants [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>]. Three weeks after insect infestation, the plants were tested for Lso infection using the LsoF/OI2 primers [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>], the Lso haplotype was confirmed using the Lso SSR-1 primers [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>].</p><h3>Lso infection, RNA purification and sequencing</h3><p>Age-specific cohorts of female adult psyllids from the Lso-uninfected colony were collected and transferred to uninfected (control), LsoA- or LsoB-infected tomato plants for a 2- and a 7-day AAP. There were three replicates with 200 psyllid individuals for each AAP and Lso haplotype. The psyllids were collected from three independent colonies, and then transferred to three independent plants of each Lso haplotype. After infection, psyllid guts were dissected under the stereomicroscope (Olympus) as described in IbanezHancock and Tamborindeguy [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>]. RNA samples for Illumina sequencing were purified using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) followed by DNase I treatment with Turbo DNase (Ambion, Invitrogen, CA). Each RNA sample was ribo-depleted to remove psyllid rRNA using RiboMinus Transcriptome Isolation kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) combined with 100 pmol of psyllid specific probes [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>]. The depleted samples were submitted to Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Genomics and Bioinformatic center for quality analysis, library preparation, and transcriptome sequencing. cDNA libraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit v2 (Illumina®; San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Libraries were multiplexed and sequenced on aHiseq-2500 platform (accession GSE206877).</p><h3>Bioinformatic analyses</h3><p>The Illumina pipeline programs for sequence processing were used to produce FASTQ files, sort libraries and remove barcodes and adaptors. The high quality reads were analyzed in the Discovery Environment web interface and platform at CyVerse (<a href=\"http://www.cyverse.org/\">http://www.cyverse.org/</a>) using the Tuxedo suite [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>]. The RNA-seq reads that passed the quality filters (i.e., Phred quality scores &gt;\\u200935) were mapped to the global transcriptome developed in our previous study [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>]. The expression levels were calculated by using the Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM) method. Genes with an adjusted <em>p</em>-value (false discovery rate, FDR) of less than 0.01 and fold change greater than or equal to 2.0 were considered as significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs). RStudio (<a href=\"https://rstudio.com/\">https://rstudio.com</a>) was used for cluster dendrogram and principal component analyses (PCA). DEGs were annotated by BLASTx searches against NCBI’s non-redundant (nr) database (E-value cut off 1e-5) and UniProt database (<a href=\"https://www.uniprot.org/\">https://www.uniprot.org/</a>) using BLAST+ tools in Galaxy [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>]. To further obtain an overview of the biological functions of the genes, all DEGs were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation using WEGO 2.0 (<a href=\"http://wego.genomics.org.cn/\">http://wego.genomics.org.cn/</a>) [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>] and mapped to terms in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database using KOBAS 3.0 (<a href=\"http://kobas.cbi.pku.edu.cn/\">http://kobas.cbi.pku.edu.cn/</a>) and KEGG Mapper (<a href=\"https://www.genome.jp/kegg/tool/map_pathway2.html\">https://www.genome.jp/kegg/tool/map_pathway2.html</a>). Enrichment analysis was used to identify the GO terms and significantly regulated KEGG pathways.</p><h3>Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) validation</h3><p>Ten genes related to the representative category (e.g., digestion, ubiquitin, zinc finger, immunity, and mitochondria) were selected for validating the bioinformatic analyses by RT-qPCR. For this validation, female adult psyllids from the Lso-uninfected colony were allowed to feed for 2 and 7 days on uninfected, LsoA-, and LsoB-infected tomato plants as previously described to obtain independent samples (three replicates). The psyllids were collected from three independent colonies, and then transferred to three independent plants of each Lso haplotype. These samples were obtained independently of the samples used for RNAseq. RNA was purified from pools of psyllid guts as previously described. cDNA synthesis reactions were performed from each total RNA pool (independent from those used for sequencing). Five hundred nanograms of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Verso cDNA Synthesis kit (Thermo, Waltham, MA) and anchored-Oligo (dT) primers following the manufacturer’s instructions. The RT-qPCR reactions were performed using SensiFAST SYBR Hi-ROX Kit (Bioline, Taunton, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each reaction contained 5 ng of cDNA, 250 nM of each primer (<a href=\"#pone.0287396.s003\">S1 Table</a>) and 1X of SYBR Green Master Mix; the volume was adjusted to 10 μL using nuclease-free water. The RT-qPCR program was 95°C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 5 sec and 60°C for 30 sec. RT-qPCR assays were performed using an Applied Biosystems™ QuantStudio™ 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Reactions for all samples were performed in triplicates with a negative control in each run. The relative expression of the candidate genes were estimated with the delta delta CT method [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref038\" class=\"ref-tip\">38</a>], using two reference genes of elongation factor-1a (GenBank KT185020) and ribosomal protein subunit 18 (GenBank KT279693) [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>].</p><h2>Results</h2><h3>Overview of the transcriptome dataset</h3><p>We performed RNA-seq analysis of the gut of adult potato psyllids that were exposed to uninfected (control), LsoA- or LsoB-infected tomato plants for a 2- and a 7-day AAP, respectively. Therefore, six treatments were generated in this study: (1) 2 days Lso-free, (2) 7 days Lso-free, (3) 2 days LsoA-infection, (4) 7 days LsoA-infection, (5) 2 days LsoB-infection, and (6) 7 days LsoB-infection. Three biological replicates were analyzed per treatment, with a total of 18 independent libraries constructed. After sequencing, each library generated around 36–54 million reads and approximately 39.3–44.1% (<a href=\"#pone.0287396.s004\">S2 Table</a>) of the reads in each library mapped to the global transcriptome developed in our previous study [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>]. The PCA plot and cluster dendrogram of samples from the 18 libraries showed the mixture of non-infected and Lso-infected samples but a clear separation between the non-infected and the 2-day Lso-infected psyllids and 7-day Lso-infected psyllids based on the analysis of six treatments (<a href=\"#pone.0287396.s001\">S1</a> and <a href=\"#pone.0287396.s002\">S2</a> Figs).</p><p>A total of 1,580 DEGs were identified with an adjusted <em>p-</em>value (FDR) lower than 0.01 and a fold change greater than or equal to 2.0. There were 58 DEGs identified by comparing the gut transcriptomes of Lso-uninfected, LsoA-, or LsoB-infected insects after a 2-day feeding. Specifically, there were 41 DEGs when comparing the guts from the LsoB-infected and Lso-uninfected psyllids, 13 DEGs when comparing the guts from the LsoA-infected and Lso-uninfected psyllids, only 2 of those were common in these two comparisons, and both were down-regulated in response to the bacterial infection. Forty-six DEGs were identified when comparing the transcriptomes of the LsoA- and LsoB-infected guts. For the first objective of evaluating the haplotype effect, 34 DEGs with 17 up-regulated genes and 17 down-regulated genes were identified in response to LsoB specifically after a 2-day AAP; while only 6 DEGs were up-regulated in response to LsoA specifically. In addition, 2 DEGs were down-regulated in response to both LsoA and LsoB (<a href=\"#pone-0287396-g001\">Fig 1A</a>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>(A) The number of DEGs in response to Lso after an AAP of 2 days; (B) The number of DEGs in response to Lso after an AAP of 7 days; (C) The number of DEGs in response to Lso after 2 days and 7 days.

A total of 1,115 DEGs were identified, of which 867 when comparing the gut transcriptomes of the LsoB-infected and Lso-uninfected psyllids, 109 when comparing the gut transcriptomes of the LsoA-infected and Lso-uninfected psyllids, and 541 when comparing the gut transcriptomes of the LsoA-infected and LsoB-infected psyllids. 342 DEGs with 340 up-regulated and 2 down-regulated genes were identified in response to LsoB specifically after an AAP of 7 days; while only 28 DEGs were up-regulated and 6 were down-regulated in response to LsoA specifically. In addition, 23 DEGs were identified in response to both LsoA and LsoB, and three of them were also differentially expressed when comparing the guts from the LsoA- and LsoB-infected psyllids (<a href=\"#pone-0287396-g001\">Fig 1B</a>).</p><p>The temporal comparison of the gut transcriptomic profiles showed that there were 9 DEGs when comparing the guts of the Lso-uninfected psyllids, 210 DEGs when comparing the guts of the LsoA-infected psyllids, and 1,369 DEGs when comparing the guts of the LsoB-infected psyllids. Among those DEGs, 162 were exclusive to the response to LsoA with 30 down-regulated genes when comparing the 2- and 7-day AAPs, and 1,321 DEGs were only identified in response to LsoB with 11 of those being down-regulated. In addition, 44 DEGs with only 3 down-regulated genes were identified in response to both LsoA and LsoB (<a href=\"#pone-0287396-g001\">Fig 1C</a>).</p><h3>DEGs associated with digestive proteins and transporters</h3><p>Asian citrus psyllid gut digestive proteins such as aminopeptidase have been exploited by <em>Ca</em>. L. asiaticus” (CLas) [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>]. In this study, we also found that several digestive enzymes such as carboxypeptidase, maltase, trehalase, lipase, aminopeptidase as well as proteases were up-regulated in response to LsoB specifically after an AAP of 7 days (<a href=\"#pone-0287396-t001\">Table 1</a>). In addition to digestive enzymes, many genes encoding carbohydrate transporters such as facilitated trehalose transporter Tret1-like and glucose transporter were also up-regulated upon LsoB infection. Moreover, both LsoA and LsoB triggered the expression of ion transporters or channels involved in digestion; for example, sodium, potassium, zinc, heme as well as calcium channels displayed up-regulated profiles after an AAP of 7 days. Genes encoding ABC (ATP binding cassette) transporters also responded to LsoA and LsoB. These proteins transport endogenous substrates, hydrophobic compounds and metabolites across the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#pone-0287396-t001\">Table 1</a>). However, no digestion-related genes were significantly regulated upon Lso infection after an AAP of 2 days.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287396.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287396.t001</a></p><h3>DEGs associated with stress response, immunity, and detoxification</h3><p>Microbial infection elicits immune responses and imparts stress. Several stress response-, immunity- and detoxification-related genes were regulated in response to both LsoA and LsoB but especially to LsoB after an AAP of 7 days rather than 2 days. The genes encoding heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) were up-regulated in response to LsoB after a 7-day AAP (<a href=\"#pone-0287396-t002\">Table 2</a>). In addition, genes related to response to stress stimulus were also highly up-regulated, e.g., tribbles homolog 2, ras-related proteins, short neuropeptide F, GTP-binding protein, atrial natriuretic peptide receptor, and glutathione peroxidase (<a href=\"#pone-0287396-t002\">Table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287396.t002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287396.t002</a></p><p>We also observed regulation of genes related to cellular and humoral immune responses. We found that whether from the infection type or the temporal perspective, after a 7-day AAP, LsoA down-regulated laminin subunit alpha and up-regulated phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which are involved in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)—protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway and forkhead box O (FoxO) signaling pathway, respectively (<a href=\"#pone-0287396-t002\">Table 2</a>). Genes involved in ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, apoptosis and autophagy pathways were up-regulated in response to LsoB after a 7-day AAP. For example, several ubiquitin-protein ligases, and genes encoding baculoviral IAP repeat-containing proteins (IAPs) and autophagy-related proteins (ATGs) were up-regulated in response to LsoB compared to Lso-free and LsoA (Tables <a href=\"#pone-0287396-t002\">2</a> and <a href=\"#pone-0287396-t003\">3</a>). In addition, eight serine/threonine-protein kinase genes involved in signal transduction for numerous physiological events were induced specifically by LsoB after a 7-day AAP. The genes up-regulated by LsoB after a 7-day AAP included protein kinase C, nitrogen permease regulator 2-like protein and ras-related GTP-binding proteins, which are involved in the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, and ETS-like proteins and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which are involved in the MAPK signaling pathway (<a href=\"#pone-0287396-t002\">Table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287396.t003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287396.t003</a></p><p>In addition to stress response and immunity pathways, LsoB also triggered detoxification pathways by up-regulating GSTs and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase genes (<a href=\"#pone-0287396-t002\">Table 2</a>). The ABC transporters that are involved in detoxification in insects were up-regulated by LsoA and LsoB as well (<a href=\"#pone-0287396-t001\">Table 1</a>).</p><h3>DEGs associated with gut epithelium renewal, cell cycle and DNA repair</h3><p>It was shown that insect gut epithelium renewal is associated with pathogen infection [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>]. In our study, we found that only LsoB induced the expression of genes involved in gut epithelium renewal, cell cycle and DNA repair after a 2- and 7-day AAP. First, the genes encoding armadillo segment polarity protein, protein kinase C, and protein wingless-like, which are involved in Wnt signaling pathway, as well as patj homolog and ras association domain-containing protein, which are involved in Hippo signaling pathway, showed up-regulated profiles after a 7-day AAP (<a href=\"#pone-0287396-t004\">Table 4</a>). However, we also noted that after a 2-day AAP, LsoB down-regulated a wingless-like gene. Second, the genes related to cell proliferation processes such as cell cycle and repair were also up-regulated in response to LsoB after a 7-day AAP. For example, LsoB significantly induced the genes encoding ubiquitin-protein ligases, serine/threonine-protein kinase, sister chromatid cohesion protein, protein lin-52 homolog, general transcription factor IIH subunit as well as TATA element modulatory factor (<a href=\"#pone-0287396-t004\">Table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287396.t004\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287396.t004</a></p><h4>DEGs associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and other functions.</h4><p>Intracellular pathogen infection modulates mitochondrial dynamics in vector cells [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>]. In this study, a total of 21 mitochondrial proteins were differentially expressed in Lso-infected psyllid guts. Almost all of those genes were specifically up-regulated upon exposure to LsoB (<a href=\"#pone-0287396-t005\">Table 5</a>). Two of those genes encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase and succinyl-CoA ligase, which are involved in the citric acid (TCA) cycle, were up-regulated after a 7-day AAP. In addition to the mitochondria-related genes, a large number of zinc finger genes involved in multiple functions (e.g., DNA binding) were significantly induced in response to LsoA and LsoB after a 7-day AAP (<a href=\"#pone.0287396.s005\">S3 Table</a>). We also listed all the well-annotated down-regulated DEGs in <a href=\"#pone.0287396.s006\">S4 Table</a>. For example, whether from the haplotype or the temporal perspective, after a 7-day AAP, LsoB down-regulated shootin-1 gene, which is involved in neuronal polarization and axon outgrowth. Some of these DEGs are uncharacterized proteins with unknown functions, which might also play key roles in the interactions between Lso and the potato psyllid (<a href=\"#pone.0287396.s006\">S4 Table</a>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287396.t005\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287396.t005</a></p><h3>Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway</h3><p>To identify the biological roles of the DEGs, we further utilized GO enrichment analyses to determine the functions of the DEGs. From the perspective of the haplotype effect (for both 2- and 7-day infection), the DEGs were categorized into 28 secondary GO categories under the cellular component, molecular function, and biological process divisions. Specifically, both LsoA and LsoB mostly induced genes with “catalytic activity”, “binding”, “metabolic process”, and “cellular process” annotations. However, the DEGs with the “biological adhesion” and “locomotion” annotations were exclusive to the response to LsoA while LsoB mostly changed the expression of genes in the “membrane-enclosed lumen”, “response to stimulus”, and “signaling” categories (<a href=\"#pone-0287396-g002\">Fig 2A</a>). From the temporal perspective, the enrichments of DEGs were largely similar to the assignments from the haplotype perspective with “catalytic activity”, “binding”, “metabolic process”, and “cellular process” as the most represented terms. However, only LsoA infection mostly changed the expression of genes with “antioxidant activity”; genes in the categories such as “cellular component organization or biogenesis” and “molecular function regulator” were in regulated response to LsoB specifically (<a href=\"#pone-0287396-g002\">Fig 2B</a>). To identify signaling pathways involved in Lso and potato psyllid interactions at the gut interface, we mapped the DEGs to the KEGG database. The top 20 enriched pathways in response to LsoB are shown in <a href=\"#pone-0287396-g003\">Fig 3</a>. From the haplotype effect perspective (both for 2- and 7-day infection), the DEGs were highly clustered in the “Metabolic”, “Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis”, “Wnt signaling pathway” and “mTOR signaling” pathway (<a href=\"#pone-0287396-g003\">Fig 3A</a>). From the temporal perspective, the “Metabolic”, “Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis”, “Hippo signaling pathway”, and “Ribosome” were the main regulated pathways (<a href=\"#pone-0287396-g003\">Fig 3B</a>). However, few enriched pathways such as metabolic and ubiquitin-mediated pathways were identified for the DEGs in response to LsoA, possibly due to the lower number of genes significantly induced or repressed.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec5.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec5.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>(A) GO classification of DEGs based on the first objective: The haplotype effect; (B) GO classification of DEGs based on the second objective: The temporal profile (from 2 days to 7 days).

The ten genes included E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd-4 isoform X9 (Nedd4); E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIP12 (TRIP12); heat shock 70 kDa protein cognate 2-like (Hsp70); patj homolog (Patj); ras association domain-containing protein 2 isoform X2 (RASSF2); zinc finger protein 728-like (ZN728); zinc finger protein 91 (ZN91); facilitated trehalose transporter Tret1 (Tret1); HIG1 domain family member 2A; mitochondrial (HIGD2A); and ubiquitin conjugation factor E4 A (UBE4A). The qPCR validation was performed using independent samples from the ones submitted for sequencing. We found that most of the genes showed concordant direction of change between the bioinformatic and qPCR results except for two genes, ZN728 and Tret1 (<a href=\"#pone-0287396-g004\">Fig 4</a>); indicating the accuracy and reliability of our DGEs libraries.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec6.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec6.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>The mean ± SE was calculated to determine the relative transcript levels using the delta delta CT method.</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287396.g004\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287396.g004</a></p><h2>Discussion</h2><p>We have previously shown differences in the accumulation of LsoA and LsoB in the gut of adult psyllids, which correlated with difference in their transmission [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>]. The analysis of the gut transcriptome can reveal the potential mechanisms underlying the molecular interactions between the potato psyllid and Lso.</p><p>In general, we found that each Lso haplotype triggered a unique transcriptional response, with most of the distinct genes elicited by LsoB. Indeed, results from our previous studies indicated that LsoB was more pathogenic to its host plants and insect vector [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]. The differences in pathogenicity could be linked to specific genes, for example distinct effector proteins secreted by each Lso haplotype. Meanwhile, the Lso copy number could also contribute to the difference of gene expression since our previous studies showing LsoA copy number is lower than that of LsoB in the gut [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>]. It is also noteworthy that most DEGs were up-regulated by Lso infection, while only few were down-regulated, which contrasts with the gut transcriptome analysis of the Asian citrus psyllid in response to CLas [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>], in which most of the DEGs were down-regulated. Differences in the response of adult psyllids to CLas and Lso are expected. Several differences have been described between these two pathosystems: while CLas infection increases the fecundity of Asian citrus psyllid females [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>], Lso infection results in decreased fecundity [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref045\" class=\"ref-tip\">45</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref046\" class=\"ref-tip\">46</a>], or psyllids that acquire CLas as adults rarely vector this pathogen [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref047\" class=\"ref-tip\">47</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref049\" class=\"ref-tip\">49</a>], while potato psyllids can efficiently acquire and transmit Lso as adults [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref050\" class=\"ref-tip\">50</a>]. These differences between these systems could be linked to differences between the insects, for instance immune responses elicited, or differences between the pathogens such as distinct secreted effectors. Discrepancies between the two systems were already described through transcriptome analyses [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref051\" class=\"ref-tip\">51</a>] or the evaluation of programmed cell death in the gut of the vectors in response to the pathogens [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref052\" class=\"ref-tip\">52</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref053\" class=\"ref-tip\">53</a>]. Furthermore, the gut response of the carrot psyllid <em>B</em>. <em>trigonica</em> gut to Lso was also different, as many key genes involved in the ERAD and UPR pathways in were induced by Lso haplotype D [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>] but not in the present study.</p><p>Lso can alter the physiology of its vector [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref054\" class=\"ref-tip\">54</a>], but the physiology and molecular biology of the potato psyllid digestive system has rarely been reported. Exposure to CLas repressed several Asian citrus psyllid digestive enzymes and the expression of transporters [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>]. Our transcriptome analysis revealed that LsoB regulated the expression of genes encoding all the common insect digestive enzymes, carbohydrases, lipases, and proteinases after a 7-day AAP. Digestive proteases, which include serine proteases (e.g., trypsin and chymotrypsin) and cysteine proteases (e.g., cathepsin), are expressed abundantly in some hemipteran insects such as aphids and planthoppers [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref055\" class=\"ref-tip\">55</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref057\" class=\"ref-tip\">57</a>]. None of the serine proteases were induced by LsoB; however, cathepsins, which often are active at slightly acidic pH [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref058\" class=\"ref-tip\">58</a>], were up-regulated. It is interesting that none of the genes encoding digestive enzymes were regulated by LsoA. However, both LsoA and LsoB up-regulated sugar transporters and ion channels such as the facilitated trehalose transporters and potassium channels. Trehalose is the most abundant sugar in the insect hemolymph, and is the main source of energy and carbon for insects. It has been observed that changes in the membrane environment of cells alter the activity and metabolism of trehalose [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref059\" class=\"ref-tip\">59</a>]. Based on our study, it is likely that the regulation of trehalose transporters by Lso changes the energy uptake or even the physiology of the potato psyllid gut and hemolymph. This phenomenon was also observed in the Asian citrus psyllid, however in this latter species facilitated trehalose transporters were down-regulated by CLas [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>]. Lso could also disturb ion homeostasis in the psyllid gut by up-regulating ion transporters or channels. For example, ABC transporters import or export a wide variety of substrates ranging from small ions to macromolecules [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref060\" class=\"ref-tip\">60</a>]. They are mainly involved in diverse cellular processes such as the maintenance of the osmotic homeostasis, nutrient uptake, immunity against bacteria and pathogenesis [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref060\" class=\"ref-tip\">60</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref061\" class=\"ref-tip\">61</a>]. In our study, several ABC transporters were among the DEGs in response to LsoA and LsoB. Overall, Lso appears to affect psyllid digestion at the later infection period since none of the digestion-related genes were regulated significantly upon Lso infection after a 2-day AAP.</p><p>In addition, Lso might modify psyllid metabolic processes based on the evidence that LsoA and LsoB infection resulted in the regulation of genes annotated within the “metabolic process” of the biological process category and “metabolic” signaling pathways based on GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. It has been shown previously that liberibacter bacteria can manipulate their insect vectors’ energy metabolism. For example, CLas alters the energy metabolism of its vector securing its need for energetic nucleotides [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref062\" class=\"ref-tip\">62</a>]. Besides, we also observed that Lso regulated many genes involved in mitochondrial functions and the TCA cycle. For example, three key enzymes—pyruvate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and succinyl-CoA ligase—were up-regulated by LsoB; however, these genes were down-regulated in the Asian citrus psyllid by CLas [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>], which the same pattern as observed for the digestion enzymes.</p><p>The innate immune response plays a key role in the defense against microbial infections in invertebrates [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref063\" class=\"ref-tip\">63</a>]. Our data showed that following Lso infection, the expression of genes involved in the psyllid immune responses including the humoral and cellular responses were induced. The activation of immune responses is probably the evolved strategy of the potato psyllid to protect itself to some extent from the deleterious effects of Lso. It is interesting that LsoA and LsoB seem to induce different immune pathways (<a href=\"#pone-0287396-g005\">Fig 5</a>) in the potato psyllid gut. Specifically, LsoA repressed the PI3K-Akt pathway but activated the FoxO signaling pathway by down-regulating laminin subunit gene and up-regulating phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. In fact, the FoxO transcription factors are negatively regulated by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and considered to have an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation and survival [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref064\" class=\"ref-tip\">64</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref065\" class=\"ref-tip\">65</a>]. Therefore, it is most likely that LsoA promotes gut cell death by inhibiting the PI3K-Akt pathway and activating FoxO signaling pathway. In contrast, we observed that two inhibitors of apoptosis were up-regulated by LsoB after an AAP of 7 days. Recently, programmed cell death (apoptosis and autophagy) gained importance as affecting the transmission of plant pathogens by phloem-feeders such as whiteflies, planthoppers and leafhoppers [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref066\" class=\"ref-tip\">66</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref068\" class=\"ref-tip\">68</a>]. We hypothesize that the regulation of the cell death pathways could be a psyllid adaptation to limit Lso invasion or a strategy used by Lso to enhance its transmission. Apoptosis was reported in the gut of CLas-infected Asian citrus psyllid adults [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref052\" class=\"ref-tip\">52</a>] but no evidence of apoptosis was found in the gut of nymphs [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref069\" class=\"ref-tip\">69</a>]; this response could be a factor explaining the developmental differences of CLas acquisition by the vector. In our previous studies, we found no evidence of apoptosis in the gut of potato psyllid adults [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref053\" class=\"ref-tip\">53</a>] and that both LsoA and LsoB up-regulated inhibitors of apoptosis [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref070\" class=\"ref-tip\">70</a>] and autophagy [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref071\" class=\"ref-tip\">71</a>]. In the present study, we also found genes involved in mTOR and MAPK pathways specifically up-regulated by LsoB after an AAP of 7 days. Both pathways play important roles in energy homeostasis and innate immunity, regulating cell proliferation and survival [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref072\" class=\"ref-tip\">72</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref074\" class=\"ref-tip\">74</a>].</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287396.g005\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287396.g005</a></p><p>LsoB also triggered detoxification pathways by up-regulating GSTs and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase genes. GSTs comprise a diverse class of enzymes that detoxify stress-causing agents, including toxic oxygen free radical species, and they can be up-regulated in arthropods upon oxidative stress and microbial challenges [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref075\" class=\"ref-tip\">75</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref076\" class=\"ref-tip\">76</a>]. In the Asian citrus psyllid gut, cytochrome P450s, GSTs and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase were also triggered by CLas but showed decreased expression profiles [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>]. As indicated above, ABC transporters which are also involved in detoxification [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref077\" class=\"ref-tip\">77</a>] were up-regulated by Lso as well. This suggests that these two liberibacter species have distinct effects on their vectors.</p><p>The ability of the host to survive an infection relies not only on resistance mechanisms that eliminate the pathogen but also on tolerance mechanisms that increase the capacity of the host to endure the infection [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref078\" class=\"ref-tip\">78</a>]. The function of gut epithelial renewal in host-pathogen interactions has been well demonstrated. For example, Buchon et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>] observed that ingestion of the bacterium <em>Erwinia carotovora</em> subsp. <em>carotovora</em> 15 provokes a massive increase in <em>Drosophila</em> epithelial renewal. In our study, we found that the genes or pathways involved in gut epithelium renewal, cell cycle and DNA repair were exclusively induced by the highly virulent LsoB after an AAP of 7 days. Probably, genes such as protein wingless-like and patj homolog in Wnt, as well as those involved in the Hippo signaling pathway may help attenuate the gut cell damage by LsoB infection. We also noted that in response to LsoB, the expression of a wingless-like gene was reduced after an AAP of 2 days, just when LsoB is about to enter the gut cells. In addition, some genes from the ubiquitin-proteasome system play roles in regulating the Hippo pathway. For example, E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4 works as a key regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway and overexpression of this gene in <em>D</em>. <em>melanogaster</em> induces proliferation of the midgut epithelium [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref079\" class=\"ref-tip\">79</a>]. In our study, the Nedd4 gene was also up-regulated by LsoB after an AAP of 7 days. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that pathogens are able to alter the host cell cycle to achieve the replication and expression of their genomes [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref080\" class=\"ref-tip\">80</a>]. The up-regulation of genes such as serine/threonine-protein kinase and sister chromatid cohesion protein suggests that LsoB probably disturbs the normal cell cycle and DNA repair in the potato psyllid gut [<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref081\" class=\"ref-tip\">81</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287396.ref082\" class=\"ref-tip\">82</a>].</p><p>In summary, ingestion of Lso had a dramatic impact on the physiology of psyllid gut that included the modulation of the expression of genes involved in digestion and metabolism, stress response, immunity, detoxification as well as cell proliferation and epithelium renewal. Furthermore, our data showed that the potato psyllid mounts distinct responses upon infection with two Lso haplotypes from both the haplotype and temporal perspectives. Few genes were regulated after an AAP of 2 days, but after an AAP of 7 days the majority of DEGs were involved in digestive function, immunity, cell renewal, and mitochondrial function. The information in our study may offer hints for discovery of novel and specific molecular targets for disrupting Lso transmission within psyllid vector.</p><h2>Supporting information</h2><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287396.s001\">S1 Fig. </a>Principal component analysis (PCA) of 18 libraries across six treatments samples.</h3><p class=\"preSiDOI\">Principal component analysis (PCA) of 18 libraries across six treatments samples.

In this study, we examined whether this reduction translated to reduced hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) visits associated with influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, human parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, and common cold coronavirus in Ontario.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>Hospital admissions were identified from the Discharge Abstract Database and exclude elective surgical admissions and non-emergency medical admissions (January 2017-March 2022). Emergency department (ED) visits were identified from the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System. International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes were used to classify hospital visits by virus type (January 2017-May 2022).</p><h3>Results</h3><p>At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitalizations for all viruses were reduced to near-trough levels. Hospitalizations and ED visits for influenza (9,127/year and 23,061/year, respectively) were nearly absent throughout the pandemic (two influenza seasons; April 2020-March 2022). Hospitalizations and ED visits for RSV (3,765/year and 736/year, respectively) were absent for the first RSV season during the pandemic, but returned for the 2021/2022 season. This resurgence of hospitalizations for RSV occurred earlier in the season than expected, was more likely among younger infants (age ≤6 months), more likely among older children (aged 6.1–24 months), and less likely to comprise of patients residing in higher areas of ethnic diversity (p&lt;0.0001).</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a reduced the burden of other respiratory infections on patients and hospitals. The epidemiology of respiratory viruses in the 2022/23 season remains to be seen.</p><p><strong>Citation: </strong>Habbous S, Hota S, Allen VG, Henry M, Hellsten E (2023) Changes in hospitalizations and emergency department respiratory viral diagnosis trends before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, Canada.

While surveillance data on incidence of these respiratory viruses is often publicly available, hospital volumes is a more direct measure of the burden of respiratory viruses on health care systems and patients, particularly as people may have avoided going to clinics for testing due fears of contracting SARS-CoV-2 [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>].</p><p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of people affected by influenza, RSV, and the broader array of respiratory viruses decreased in many countries [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>]. Although this may be partially driven by viral interference caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, reduced testing due to reagent shortages, and laboratory burden, the main drivers are likely modifications in human behavior as a result of public health measures (e.g. restrictions, lockdowns) and individual risk-reduction tactics (e.g. mask-wearing, avoiding crowded spaces, increased hand hygiene) to combat the COVID-19 pandemic [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. At the time of writing, the majority of the published literature has focused on the initial pandemic year when restrictions were heightened. More recently, analysis of surveillance data from countries in the southern hemisphere suggest a resurgence in RSV as restrictions eased, but less data are available for countries in more northern climates [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>].</p><p>In the present study we examined year-over-year trends in hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits associated with various respiratory viruses in Ontario, Canada.</p><h2>Methods</h2><p>Hospital care episodes starting between January 1, 2017 and the most recent data were included (weeks starting March 25, 2022 for admissions and May 20, 2022 for emergency department (ED) visits for complete weekly counts). Ontario is Canada’s most populous province (~14.5 million) and healthcare is provided under a single-payer system.</p><p>Hospital admissions were identified from the Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) and emergency department (ED) visits from the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS). To avoid double-counting, admissions and ED visits were resolved into episodes of care after accounting for hospital transfers and readmissions as previously described [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. We modified this definition by considering planned admissions (readmit code 1) within 1 week of the previous discharge as part of the previous episode [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. Non-emergency surgical or medical admissions were excluded.</p><p>The International Classification of Diseases, 10<sup>th</sup> revision (ICD-10) codes used to identify influenza (J09, J10.0, J10.1, J10.8, J11.0, J11.1, J11.8) and RSV (J12.1, J20.5, J21.0, B97.4) were previously validated against the Ontario Laboratories Information System (OLIS) and used all diagnostic codes for the admission (up to 25) [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]. For influenza, the best-performing algorithm yielded 73% sensitivity and 98% specificity (FLU2) and for RSV 69% sensitivity and 99% specificity (RSV1) [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]. In the absence of validation studies for the human metapneumovirus (hMPV; J12.3, J21.1, A85.8, J20.8, B97.81), rhinovirus/enterovirus (B34.1, J20.6, B97.1), adenovirus (B34.0, B97.0), human parainfluenza virus (hPINV; J12.2, J20.4), or common cold coronavirus (B34.2, B97.2), we similarly included all diagnostic types (e.g. not restricted to the most responsible diagnosis) and extended this to ED visits as well (up to 10 diagnostic codes per record). Rhinovirus and enterovirus were grouped together since many molecular diagnostic assays do not distinguish them [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>].</p><h3>Covariates</h3><p>Age at admission and sex were obtained from the Registered Persons Database (RPDB). Residence in long-term care was ascribed if the patient had any primary care billing code starting with “W” from the Ontario Health Insurance Program or had a prior admission to/from a long-term care residence in the previous year. Sociodemographic characteristics were obtained using the patients’ most recent postal code (RPDB) and linked to the 2016 Census (rurality) and the Ontario Marginalization Index for neighborhood-level marginalization. The Ontario Marginalization index is a linear combination of neighborhood-level socioeconomic characteristics from the Canada Census. It was estimated using a principal component analysis, generating four primary orthogonal factors categorized into quintile measures of material deprivation, residential instability, dependency, and ethnic diversity [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>].</p><h3>Context</h3><p>The COVID-19 pandemic was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. On March 17, 2020, Ontario declared a province-wide state of emergency. At the time of analysis, data were available through the putative end of the fifth wave (dominated by the Omicron B.1.1.529 variant) of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the province. Approximate start dates of COVID-19 waves in Ontario were February 26, 2020 (wave 1 –predominately the SARS-CoV-2 wildtype variant), September 1, 2020 (wave 2 –predominately wildtype), March 1, 2021 (wave 3 –predominately the Alpha variant), August 1, 2021 (wave 4 –predominately Delta), and December 15, 2021 (wave 5 –predominately Omicron B.1.1.529) [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>].</p><h3>Outcomes</h3><p>During the admission episode, we examined the utilization of intensive care units (ICU) (special care unit codes 10, 30, 70, or 80) and use of respiratory support (1GZ30, 1GZ31, 1GZ32, 1GZ35, 1GZ38). Total length of stay in days was computed at the level of the entire admission episode.</p><h3>Statistics and privacy</h3><p>The predicted levels of admissions or emergency department visits were constructed using a linear regression on the weekly number of visits between January 2017 and February 2020 using calendar year, month, and holiday weeks as predictors. This was then extrapolated into the COVID-19 era. By viral admission, we used logistic regression to compare patient and admission characteristics, ICU use, and respiratory support in the COVID-19 era versus the pre-COVID-19 era, presenting odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). P-values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p><p>All analyses were conducted using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS Institute., Cary, NC). Values &lt;6 were suppressed to prevent re-identification. This study was compliant with section 45(1) of PHIPA (Ontario Health is a prescribed entity): ethics review was not required.</p><h2>Results</h2><h3>Influenza</h3><p>Pre-pandemic (July 1, 2017 –June 30, 2019), there were 9127 admissions and 23,061 ED visits associated with influenza per year, with 2.5-times as many ED visits as admissions (<a href=\"#pone-0287395-t001\">Table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.t001</a></p><p>Admissions and ED visits due to influenza had seasonal peaks in the winter months (December–March) and troughs in the summer months (July–August) (<a href=\"#pone-0287395-g001\">Fig 1a</a>). At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, admissions due to influenza quickly dropped to trough levels and did not increase again through to the end of the study period. ED visits displayed a similar pattern with a 14-fold reduction in ED visits expected in a given influenza season (e.g. 1738 in the 2020/21 season versus 24,443 the previous year; <a href=\"#pone-0287395-t001\">Table 1</a>; <a href=\"#pone-0287395-g002\">Fig 2a</a>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>Hospital admissions associated with influenza (A), respiratory syncytial virus (B), human metapneumovirus (C), and rhinovirus/enterovirus.</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.g001</a></p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig2.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig2.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>Emergency department visits associated with influenza (A), respiratory syncytial virus (B), human metapneumovirus (C), and rhinovirus/enterovirus.</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.g002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.g002</a></p><h3>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)</h3><p>At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, both admissions and ED visits for RSV quickly dropped, but the timing coincided with the tail end of RSV-related seasonal hospital activity (<a href=\"#pone-0287395-g001\">Fig 1b</a>). During the COVID-19 pandemic, the expected seasonal surge did not occur during the 2020/21 RSV season (21 admissions and 9 ED visits; <a href=\"#pone-0287395-t001\">Table 1</a>). However, unlike influenza, RSV-related admissions returned for the 2021/22 season (September 2021 –March 2022). ED visits due to RSV in the 2021/2022 season, although not yet complete, has already surpassed previous seasonal visits (966 ED visits versus 848 in the 2018/19 RSV season), but the ratio of admissions to ED visits remained lower than pre-pandemic levels (2.3 versus 5.1), suggesting more mild cases or a reduced proclivity towards admission.</p><p>During the study period, patients admitted for RSV were mostly &lt;24 months of age (n = 8,092; 52%) or &gt;65 years of age (n = 4,598; 29%) (<a href=\"#pone.0287395.s005\">S1 Table</a>; <a href=\"#pone.0287395.s001\">S1 Fig</a>). Compared to pre-pandemic cycles (2017/18 and 2018/19 seasons), patients admitted in the 2021/22 season for RSV were more likely to comprise of infants (39% vs 30% were 0–6 months) and children (16% vs 8% were 2–5 years), but less likely to comprise patients &gt;5 years of age (24% vs 42%) (<a href=\"#pone-0287395-t002\">Table 2</a>). RSV-related admissions occurred earlier in the year: compared with January, the relative odds of admission ranged from 4.97 in July to 3.83 in December, peaking at 10.6 in October. Admissions were less likely during the months after January with available data [OR 0.29 (0.22–0.40) in February and OR 0.57 (0.42–0.78) in March]. Patients were more likely to be admitted in the 2021/22 season if they resided in a rural area [OR 1.25 (1.03–1.50)] or if they resided in a neighbourhood with a lower ethnic diversity (p&lt;0.0001).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.t002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.t002</a></p><p>During the study period, ED visits were mostly prevalent among infants [n = 1932 (51%) were &lt;6 months] and children [n = 1167 (31%) were 6–24 months] and only 147 (4%) were &gt;65 years (<a href=\"#pone.0287395.s005\">S1 Table</a>). Compared to pre-pandemic cycles (2017/18 and 2018/19 seasons), patients visiting the ED for RSV in the 2021/22 season were more likely to occur earlier in the season with a peak in October [OR 9.99 (6.47–15.5)] and was more likely to occur among children age 2–5 [OR 1.95 (1.51–2.52)] and persons aged 5–65 [OR 1.57 (1.01–2.44)] compared with infants (<a href=\"#pone.0287395.s006\">S2 Table</a>). There were no other meaningful associations with sociodemographic characteristics.</p><h3>Human metapneumovirus (hMPV)</h3><p>Admissions due to hMPV was seasonal with a winter peak extending into the spring (<a href=\"#pone-0287395-g001\">Fig 1c</a>) and bimodal with respect to age (<a href=\"#pone.0287395.s005\">S1 Table</a>; <a href=\"#pone.0287395.s001\">S1 Fig</a>). At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, admissions declined quickly and remained similar to summer levels.</p><p>ED visits for hMPV displayed a peak in the early winter months and also dropped to a new trough at the start of the pandemic. Patients were a mean 42 (SD 24.0) years of age at admission [median 42.3 (IQR 23.6, 60.9) years] and 5383/8942 (60%) were female (<a href=\"#pone.0287395.s005\">S1 Table</a>; <a href=\"#pone.0287395.s001\">S1 Fig</a>). Despite smaller peaks occurring earlier than expected (peaks in autumn months) during the first and second hMPV seasons of the pandemic, ED visit rates remained below expected levels (<a href=\"#pone-0287395-t001\">Table 1</a>).</p><h3>Rhinovirus/enterovirus</h3><p>Patients admitted due to rhinovirus/enterovirus were a mean 17 (SD 27.7) years of age at admission [median 2.8 (IQR 0.9, 13.5) years] and 1793/4039 (44%) were female. Admissions peaked twice per year (<a href=\"#pone-0287395-g001\">Fig 1d</a>). During the COVID-19 pandemic, admissions were below expected volumes from previous seasons, temporarily approached baseline for the second peak of 2021, but dropped again at the onset of the fifth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with rhinovirus/enterovirus admissions in the pre-COVID-19 era, this brief resurgence was more likely to affect children [OR 1.56 (1.13–2.14) age 6–24 months; 1.71 (1.23–2.38) age 2–5 years] and less likely to affect the elderly [OR 0.51 (0.31–0.85) age 65+] compared with infants (p&lt;0.0001) (<a href=\"#pone.0287395.s007\">S3 Table</a>). Patients hospitalized for rhinovirus/enterovirus in the COVID-19 era were less likely to reside neighbourhoods of higher dependency [OR 0.55 (0.37–0.81) for highest versus lowest quintile] and higher ethnic diversity [OR 0.43 (0.28–0.67) for highest versus lowest quintile].</p><p>Patients visiting the ED for rhinovirus/enterovirus were a mean 7.1 (SD 11.8) years of age at admission [median 2.4 (IQR 1.24, 5.8) years] and 1475/3054 (48%) were female, but ED visits remained below expectations throughout the pandemic.</p><h3>hPINV</h3><p>Admissions for hPINV displayed a seasonal bimodal pattern with one peak in the winter and a second peak in the fall (<a href=\"#pone.0287395.s002\">S2 Fig</a>). During the COVID-19 pandemic, the spring peak of the 2019/20 season and both peaks of the 2020/21 season were absent. The winter peak of the 2021/22 season arrived early, but the spring peak did not occur, coinciding with the onset of the fifth COVID-19 wave.</p><p>ED visits related to hPINV were generally uncommon (total 8 between January 1, 2017 and June 30, 2020. This was followed by a small but notable increase in ED visits during the autumn of the 2021/22 season (total 27 between July 2021 and March 2022).</p><h3>Adenovirus</h3><p>Admissions due to adenovirus (peaks in the winter) were curtailed at the onset of the pandemic but may have partially resumed before the onset of the fifth wave of COVID-19. ED visits were generally low each year (<a href=\"#pone.0287395.s003\">S3 Fig</a>).</p><h3>Common cold coronavirus</h3><p>Admissions for common cold coronavirus was only slightly depressed during the first winter of the pandemic. However, at the onset of the pandemic (March 2020), the surge from the winter of 2019/2020 was prolonged. This was likely due to miscoding of the novel SARS-CoV-2 as common cold coronavirus, as the ICD-10 codes were not available for use until April 2020. This effect was more striking for ED visits (<a href=\"#pone.0287395.s004\">S4 Fig</a>).</p><h3>Outcomes</h3><p>Use of ICU during the admission episode was highest for hPINV (23%), followed by rhinovirus/enterovirus (18%), hMPV (14.6%), influenza (11.3%), adenovirus (9.7%), and RSV (9.2%) (<a href=\"#pone-0287395-t003\">Table 3</a>). The high rate of ICU use also observed among common cold coronaviruses (18%) may be driven by misclassification with the novel SARS-CoV-2 (<a href=\"#pone.0287395.s004\">S4 Fig</a>; <a href=\"#pone.0287395.s008\">S4 Table</a>). Respiratory support during the admission episode was highest for admissions with common-cold coronavirus (17%) and hPINV (16%), followed by hMPV (10%), rhinovirus/enterovirus (8.9%), influenza virus (7.5%), and RSV (5.8%). Total length-of-stay was highest for hPINV (median 6.6 days), hMPV (median 4.8 days), and influenza virus (median 4.7 days). ICU use in the COVID-19 era was more likely for admissions with hMPV [OR 1.89 (1.13–3.16)]. Use of respiratory support was trending higher in the COVID-19 era for hMPV [OR 1.64 (0.91–2.94)], but decreased for RSV [OR 0.61 (0.47–0.78)] and rhinovirus/enterovirus [OR 0.53 (0.34–0.82)] (<a href=\"#pone-0287395-t003\">Table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.t003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.t003</a></p><h2>Discussion</h2><p>In the present study, we observed a significant reduction in hospitalizations and ED visits associated with a range of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Different patterns of resurgence were observed for different viruses. Hospital visits due to influenza appear to have nearly vanished, but early signs of resurgence warrant caution [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>]. RSV, on the other hand, returned to baseline levels earlier than expected. Hospital visits due to hMPV, rhinovirus/enterovirus, hPINV, and adenovirus were similarly affected with either a partial or complete resurgence later in the study period.</p><p>It is reasonable to expect that the behavioural and societal modifications with non-pharmacological interventions used to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection affected the transmission of respiratory viruses differently [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>]. Some of this may be attributed to a differential contribution of respiratory droplet and aerosols versus fomites in transmission of various respiratory viruses. As influenza and hMPV are primarily transmitted through respiratory particles, it is no surprise that their impacts were suppressed by pandemic mask mandates and social distancing. On the other hand, hand hygiene and surface disinfection have been progressively deemphasized as SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention measures over the course of the pandemic. It is possible that viruses such as rhinoviruses and enteroviruses transmit more efficiently than other respiratory viruses, explaining their rising impacts later in the pandemic. Rhinoviruses are non-enveloped viruses, prolonging their survival on inanimate surfaces and enabling transmission by fomites and surface contact [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>]. Masking is also less effective against rhinoviruses than influenza [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>]. Furthermore, with milder respiratory symptoms, these rhinovirus/enterovirus infections may have escaped recognition more easily than viruses like influenza, leading to less behavioural modification that would reduce transmission. School closures and re-openings would also have influenced transmission patterns of these viruses, particularly if outbreaks went unrecognized due to a disproportional focus on SARS-CoV-2. The resurgence of rhinovirus/enterovirus observed in other regions (e.g. California, South Korea) was also observed in Ontario for hospitalizations [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>].</p><p>We observed a shift towards younger infants being admitted to hospital for RSV. These findings align with data from France and Iceland, the only two countries from a multinational study examining surveillance data from 17 countries during the first year after the start of the pandemic [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>]. Due to the missed RSV season during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced exposure may have resulted in fewer maternal antibodies being delivered <em>in-utero</em>, resulting in more hospitalizations occurring at a younger age among the 0-6-month old age group. Similarly, due to absent immunity from the missed season of RSV, older children within the age range of 2–5 years were more likely to be hospitalized during the resurgence than pre-pandemic seasons. Admissions with RSV or rhinovirus/enterovirus were less likely to comprise of patients age 65+ and more likely to comprise of young children (ages 2–5), which may be to continued adherence to various public health measures such as masking among the elderly amidst easing restrictions [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>].</p><p>In many international studies, the first expected RSV season following the onset of the non-pharmacologic interventions used to combat the COVID-19 pandemic was not observed, but was followed by an off-season resurgence [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>]. The combination of easing safeguards against SARS-CoV-2 infection back to pre-pandemic levels plus a lack of built-up immunity from prior exposure to these common viruses is expected to result in subsequent surges of infections occurring out-of-season and with increased morbidity [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>]. School re-opening and lifted stay-at-home orders were found to be the most significant drivers for a rebound of RSV [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>]. In Ontario, public schools were opened for in-person learning at the start of the 2020/2021 school year (September 2020), and was only reverted back to teacher-led remote learning by January 2021 as SARS-CoV-2 infections surged yet again [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>]. However, there was no sign of increased hospital activity due to RSV before remote learning began (<a href=\"#pone-0287395-g003\">Fig 3</a>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec4.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec4.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>Timing of restrictions and mandates related to gatherings, school events, and masking relative to the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) seasons.</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.g003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.g003</a></p><p>Reductions were also observed for influenza, but evidence of a resurgence was sparse at the time of writing [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>]. In Australia, where the seasonal surge in admissions is typically observed in the summer months, surveillance reporting from sentinel hospital sites revealed a return to pre-pandemic levels of hospital admissions for the 2022/23 season (the third since the pandemic began) with a peak in spring [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>]. It is therefore likely that the third influenza season in northern climates like Ontario will exhibit a similar pattern, arriving earlier than is typical as has been observed with RSV.</p><p>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, due to nurse and physician burn-out and absenteeism due to illness, hospitals are finding themselves understaffed and in some cases, have been forced to temporarily close EDs. At the time of writing, there is an anticipated surge of SARS-CoV-2 infected cases this coming fall/winter as in-person education resumes for the 2022/23 year. The cumulative effect of SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV surges may overwhelm already taxed EDs and healthcare staff. Furthermore, the coexistence of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza in hospitalized patients was rare in the early pandemic, but co-infection is more likely in the upcoming 2022/23 influenza season and the implications of this on viral pathogenesis and patient outcomes remains unclear [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref038\" class=\"ref-tip\">38</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>]. Alleviating strain on the healthcare system may include public health campaigns to promote influenza vaccination, further uptake of anti-RSV vaccination (maternal or among higher-risk infants and children) [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>], and exploring RSV vaccination for older adults [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>].</p><p>We did not observe a resurgence of hMPV, in contrast to reports from Western Australia, Israel, and the Netherlands [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref045\" class=\"ref-tip\">45</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref046\" class=\"ref-tip\">46</a>]. Our study also found a return of hPINV earlier than expected, and a return to pre-pandemic admissions with common cold coronavirus and adenovirus-associated, although the numbers of events were small. Similar increases were observed in England [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref047\" class=\"ref-tip\">47</a>].</p><h3>Limitations</h3><p>There are several limitations of this study that should be considered. First, hospital administrative databases are not perfect. While ICD-10 coding has moderate sensitivity (73% for influenza and 69% for RSV), provincial systemic laboratory reporting to confirm respiratory virus diagnoses (e.g. OLIS) was unavailable for this dataset [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]. Second, testing practices for the broader array of respiratory viruses is not standardized in Ontario. The Public Health Ontario Laboratory will accept samples for broader respiratory multiplex testing from 1) all symptomatic hospitalized patients, 2) the first four symptomatic patients in an outbreak, 3) symptomatic patients tested in institutional settings; and 4) children &lt;18 years old who present to the ED with compatible symptoms [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref048\" class=\"ref-tip\">48</a>]. Hospitals have different arrays of test eligibility and breadth of respiratory viral testing based on local priorities. Third, because of the testing burden on laboratories during the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals experiencing a higher burden of SARS-CoV-2 infections may have reduced their testing for other respiratory viruses based on local medical assessment, capacity of labs, financials, and competing demands [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. Similar reductions in reporting have been described elsewhere [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref049\" class=\"ref-tip\">49</a>]. We therefore expect the hospitalization rates attributable to non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses to be underestimated, particularly for ED visits since patients may be discharged without a test. Fourth, although this analysis is population-based from Ontario, the generalizability of these findings may be limited to jurisdictions with similar climates (e.g. due to alignment in the physical and social conditions conducive to transmission) and practice similar non-pharmacologic interventions. Anecdotally, Ontario took a relatively conservative stance on pandemic public health measures with a range of lockdowns, restrictions, and recommendations [<a href=\"#pone.0287395.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>].</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In Ontario, Canada, there was a reduction in hospitalizations for RSV, influenza, hMPV, rhinovirus/enterovirus, hPINV, and adenoviruses at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospital visits due to influenza remains absent, but we observed an off-peak resurgence of RSV presenting among younger infants and older children.</p><h2>Supporting information</h2><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s001\">S1 Fig. </a>Age histogram by virus and hospital visit type.</h3><p class=\"preSiDOI\">Histogram of age at admission or emergency department (ED) visit over the entire study period by virus diagnosis.</p><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s001\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s001</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(DOCX)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s002\">S2 Fig. </a>Human parainfluenza virus.</h3><p class=\"preSiDOI\">Number of hospital admissions (A) and emergency department (ED) visits associated with human parainfluenza virus (hPINV).</p><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s002\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s002</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(PDF)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s003\">S3 Fig. </a>Adenovirus.</h3><p class=\"preSiDOI\">Number of hospital admissions (A) and emergency department (ED) visits associated with adenovirus.</p><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s003\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s003</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(PDF)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s004\">S4 Fig. </a>Common cold coronavirus.</h3><p class=\"preSiDOI\">Number of hospital admissions (A) and emergency department (ED) visits associated with the common cold coronavirus.</p><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s004\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s004</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(PDF)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s005\">S1 Table. </a>Patient demographics by virus and hospital visit type.</h3><p class=\"preSiDOI\">Age and sex at the time of admission or emergency department visit associated with each virus.</p><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s005\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s005</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(DOCX)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s006\">S2 Table. </a>Characteristics of emergency department visits with respiratory syncytial virus.</h3><p class=\"preSiDOI\">Factors associated with emergency department visit associated with respiratory syncytial virus during the COVID-19 era compared with the pre-COVID-19 era.</p><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s006\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s006</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(DOCX)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s007\">S3 Table. </a>Characteristics of admissions with rhinovirus/enterovirus.</h3><p class=\"preSiDOI\">Factors associated with hospitalizations associated with rhinovirus/enterovirus during the COVID-19 era compared with the pre-COVID-19 era.</p><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s007\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s007</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(DOCX)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s008\">S4 Table. </a>Main diagnostic code (most responsible diagnosis) associated with admission episode, by viral infection.</h3><p class=\"preSiDOI\">Number and percent of admission episodes by ICD-10 code, by virus type.</p><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s008\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287395.s008</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(DOCX)</p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>Parts of this material are based on data and information compiled and provided by the Canadian Institute of Health Information (CIHI).

Ten frequent gamblers participated in semi-structured interviews oriented around their experiences of gambling marketing. An interpretative phenomenological analysis of the data led to three overarching themes: exploiting gambling marketing for personal gain; gambling marketing as a test of self-control; and safer gambling messages marketing perceived as ineffective. These themes encapsulated participants’ views of gambling marketing as something they could take advantage of to increase their own gambling success. Marketing was also perceived as a test of self-control among self-identified experienced gamblers, although identified as a risk to those who are considered more vulnerable. Finally, safer gambling messages included within marketing was considered ineffective due to perceived insincerity and being seen as an ‘afterthought’ by marketers. In support of previous research, the current investigation highlights concerning narratives around self-control and perceived risk, as encapsulated within gambling marketing, and these are evident in the perceptions of frequent gamblers. Given gamblers’ perceived lack of effectiveness of current safer gambling messages within marketing, future research should explore new avenues for safer gambling promotion.</p><p><strong>Citation: </strong>Houghton S, Punton G, Casey E, McNeill A, Moss M (2023) Frequent gamblers’ perceptions of the role of gambling marketing in their behaviour: An interpretative phenomenological analysis.

Gambling-related harms span across numerous domains, from financial impacts and emotional distress to lesser considered factors such as reduced work performance and cultural harms [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. Harms do not only impact the individual gambler, with a recent literature review highlighting the significant negative effects gambling can have on concerned significant others [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>]. Given the wide-ranging impact of gambling-related harm at both an individual and population level, much focus within the literature has been dedicated to assessing factors that contribute towards such harm.</p><p>One such proposed factor is gambling marketing which is shown to normalise gambling within sporting environments [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>], influence children to gamble [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>], encourage individuals to gamble when they are aiming to quit [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>] and encourage individuals to place more risky bets [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. The gambling industry also invests a lot of money into marketing, with £8.3 million a week spent on paid for television advertising [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. As such, it is important that research explores the role marketing has upon individuals’ behaviour and the potential to cause harm. However, assessing the impact of marketing upon gambling behaviour proves to be methodologically challenging due to the wide-ranging marketing strategies employed [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>] and the fact that marketing is just one of many factors that could influence gambling behaviour. Whilst carefully designed experimental studies can demonstrate how specific aspects of marketing may be harmful to gamblers within a simulated gambling environment, there are questions over whether such findings would replicate in a real-world setting. There has some encouraging success with longitudinal research highlighting increased spending related to increased exposure to gambling marketing, as well as the most influential types of marketing inducements [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. However, to develop a more holistic understanding of the role marketing has within an individual’s gambling behaviour, it is important to understand how marketing is perceived by bettors.</p><p>Despite this, there are only a limited number of studies which have explored the perceived impact of gambling marketing qualitatively. For example, semi-structured interviews with 25 Swedish disordered gamblers found advertising was perceived to increase their gambling problems, due to triggering impulses to gamble and creating difficulties in following through on a decision to cease gambling [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. More recently, focus groups with 43 treatment-seeking disordered gamblers in Spain explored themes around the perceived impact of marketing on their gambling behaviour [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>]; participants found price-related gambling promotions to be particularly persuasive by prompting them to calculate the potential advantage to be gained in accepting such offers. Additionally, advertising was stated to be effective in instigating the uptake of a new gambling product and also caused anticipatory anxiety in situations where gamblers expected to encounter gambling advertising.</p><p>However, these studies only focus on how marketing influences those who have been diagnosed with gambling disorder. Considering gambling-related harms occur across the spectrum of problematic gambling behaviour [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>] and research demonstrating that marketing can prompt riskier gambling behaviour regardless of problem gambling levels [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>], more recent research has explored attitudes and opinions towards marketing in those who gamble frequently but do not have a diagnosis of gambling disorder. Recent qualitative studies in the UK have highlighted a range of key findings on perceptions of gambling marketing from such populations: including the frequency at which individuals report seeing gambling advertising, its normalising effect within society, the attractiveness of inducements within gambling and the lack of effectiveness of safer gambling messaging [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>]. A grounded theory approach was also taken in an Australian study and highlighted the key component of betting-related responses to wagering inducements was through using them to minimize their losses [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. Together, these studies demonstrate that taking a qualitative approach allows gamblers to expand on how they view gambling marketing and how it might affect their gambling behaviour. However, the experience of gambling and the general relationship between gamblers and gambling marketing strategies is unique to each individual, and highly context specific [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>], and so, it is important to encapsulate these individual nuances through idiographic, qualitative means [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>].</p><p>One qualitative approach that is useful in understanding how individuals interpret experiences within their lives is Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The phenomenological nature of IPA ensures that such research revolves around developing an understanding of how people individually make sense of their social world and its experiences; [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. As such, IPA is a commonly employed method within gambling research [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>], due to its focus on the individual as well as the wider homogenous population experiencing certain phenomena [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. Within the current study, the use of IPA will not objectively measure the impact of gambling marketing upon behaviour, but instead explore how frequent gamblers make sense of the role marketing plays within their gambling lives. This is important to consider because the impact of more subtle marketing strategies [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>] is not objectively measurable at the individual level and therefore encouraging reflection upon such strategies is key to understanding how gamblers perceive and engage with them. For example, exploiting probability biases in gamblers’ behaviour may increase the amount of money spent by gamblers, but the gambler still engages in a conscious decision (accessible to phenomenological reflection) that the advertised odds look better than an alternative. It is also difficult to untangle the impact of other marketing strategies due to their highly integrative nature. Whilst such methods may be criticised from a positivist viewpoint as being too subjective, interpretation is actively encouraged within IPA as a means of exploring feelings, emotions and meanings [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>]. Furthermore, the experience of marketing on gamblers <em>is</em> inherently subjective, meaning that the only way to adequately account for it is to explore gamblers’ personal accounts of such phenomena.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of the current study is to use IPA to answer the research question ‘<em>how do frequent gamblers perceive gambling marketing and make sense of its role in their behaviour</em>?<em>’</em>.</p><h2>Method</h2><h3>Approach</h3><p>The current study will utilise a qualitative approach which will flexibly follow the IPA methodology. IPA in the current context aligns with a critical realist approach [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>]; realist insofar as we hold that participants experience real effects of marketing on their thinking and behaviour which can be recounted; critical insofar as the explanations of such experiences are likely affected by self-presentation concerns. The phenomenological aspect of IPA is also valuable in gambling research [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>], as it is important to explore and understand how certain phenomena are personally experienced and understood. IPA is idiographic in nature and is therefore useful when exploring complex social phenomena by identifying individual idiosyncrasies in behaviour and experience [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>]. IPA is therefore considered more appropriate than other qualitative approaches, mainly due to its dual-analytic approach, which focuses on idiographic accounts, as well as an overall patterning of meaning across participant accounts [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>].</p><h3>Participants</h3><p>Ten participants were recruited to take part in the study via purposeful sampling, as is typical in IPA [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. Emphasis was placed on the importance of recruiting participants that offer a detailed insight into a particular experience, and therefore a homogenous sample was sought [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. The size of the sample is deemed less important in IPA, with the concept of data saturation argued to be problematic within such an idiographic analysis [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>]. Sample size was instead guided by recommendations for doctoral IPA research from leading researchers in the area [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. The inclusion criteria for taking part in the study was that participants had to be frequent gamblers between the age of 18 and 34, as individuals from this group report gambling mostly in response to marketing [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>].</p><p>In the absence of a consistent definition within the literature [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>], frequent gambling was classified as gambling on three days a week or more. Several recruitment strategies were employed for this investigation, including advertisements on a university campus, on social media, and among local bookmakers. Participants were compensated with a £15 Amazon voucher for taking part in the study.</p><p><a href=\"#pone-0287393-t001\">Table 1</a> outlines demographic information for all recruited participants, including age, sex, employment status, ethnicity, relationship status and participant scores on the Problem Gambling Severity Index [PGSI] [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287393.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287393.t001</a></p><h3>Data collection</h3><p>The study received full ethical approval from the Northumbria University postgraduate research ethics committee (REF—12156). Upon obtaining written informed consent from each participant, semi-structured interviews were used to collect data. Participants were informed they were free to leave the interview at any point, however nobody chose to do so. Interviews were conducted on a university campus in 2019 and 2020 by researcher SH and lasted between 40 and 70 minutes. The main aim of interviews within IPA research is to allow the participant a platform to provide rich and detailed first-person accounts of a phenomena [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>]. Such methods can often uncover elements of reality that we are not able to empirically capture, therefore providing ontological depth [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>]. This is particularly relevant to the current study given the need to explore gamblers’ personal accounts and experience of marketing strategies, especially considering the need to investigate the potential cause-and-effect relationship between marketing and disordered gambling that may exists at this personal level.</p><p>The interview schedule (<a href=\"https://osf.io/8c9jg\">osf.io/8c9jg</a>) consisted of open-ended questions, alongside relevant prompts and examples of gambling marketing that were shown to participants during the interview. The final schedule consisted of 12 questions, and represented four main categories: personal gambling history, television advertisements, social media marketing and gambling within sport. Such categories allowed the researcher to steer the participants towards discussing experiences of certain types of marketing, whilst retaining the flexibility needed to pursue any interesting topics of discussion that arose through the course of the interview.</p><h3>Data analysis</h3><p>The interviews were transcribed verbatim by the lead researcher (SH) and the data was analysed using IPA, following guidelines of lead researchers within the area [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. The first stages within the analysis process were to actively listen to each interview read the transcript numerous times, and make exploratory notes on any areas of interest within the transcript. Notes made at this stage were a mixture of descriptive comments, which gave accounts of how participants discussed gambling marketing, and more conceptual comments, which explored the context in which these discussions were embedded. It is argued that this allows for identification of more abstract concepts that assist the researcher in making sense of the participant’s lived experience through ‘emergent themes’, hence representing the ‘double hermeneutic’ approach involved in IPA [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. Emergent themes were thus generated on a case-by-case basis from these exploratory notes and were clustered to create a thematic structure for each participant, capturing the different ways individual participants thought about gambling marketing. A short summary of the findings was then written up to revisit at a later stage of the analysis.</p><p>This process was repeated for each of the ten interviews carried out. The researcher used the individual summary of findings to uncover commonalities between emergent themes. Within this process, some themes were clustered together to create an overarching theme. Additionally, some themes were collapsed into a pre-existing theme which subsequently became an overarching theme. Within this theme development, it was important to ensure that the themes generated were theoretically distinct from one another. This allowed for a final thematic structure to be produced, which accounted for shared experience whilst also maintaining the idiographic nature of the analysis. A full analytic trail is accessible through the Open Science Framework (<a href=\"https://osf.io/utzds/\">osf.io/utzds/</a>).</p><h3>Role of the researcher</h3><p>As previously noted, a key aspect of IPA interviewing is that participant is provided a platform to openly discuss their experiences of a particular phenomenon [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. Most of the recruited participants were the same sex as the interviewer (SH) and were around a similar age and such methods of peer-interviewing allowed for a rapport to be developed that encouraged detailed experiential responses from participants [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref038\" class=\"ref-tip\">38</a>]. The different stages of data analysis, as described previously, were all documented and are available to view online (<a href=\"https://osf.io/utzds/\">osf.io/utzds/</a>), allowing for analytical transparency to be established [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>]. Finally, a second researcher (GP) reviewed the analysis to ensure findings were grounded in the experiences of participants.</p><h2>Results</h2><p>Three final themes were developed through the analysis that encapsulate how regular gamblers understand the role gambling marketing plays within their behaviour. The first theme ‘taking advantage of gambling marketing for personal gain’ explains how participants view marketing as something to be exploited for their own personal gain to increase their own chances of winning. The second theme ‘gambling marketing as a test of a gambler’s self-control’ covers how participants feel tempted to gamble by certain types of gambling marketing and how this is particularly risky for those who are vulnerable. The final theme ‘safer gambling messages perceived as ineffective’ describes the lack of trust and confidence participants feel towards safer gambling messages.</p><h3>Theme 1: Exploiting gambling marketing for personal gain</h3><p>Throughout the interviews, all participants discussed ways that they can take advantage of gambling marketing to enhance their gambling experience or increase their chances of gambling success. As such, marketing was presented as something which, under a skilled and considered approach, could be beneficial to individual gamblers. For example, numerous participants demonstrated how they were able to use marketing offers to reduce the risk associated with their gambling behaviour.</p><p><em>‘It’s about getting as much as you can from as little as possible</em>, <em>erm</em>, <em>so I want to say Betway are offering if you have a £10 bet ante-post–so before the market before Tuesday you’ll get a £10 free bet for each day of the festival</em>, <em>so something like that</em>. <em>I’ll have a tenner on something beforehand that I think is a banker and then I’ll have a free £10 bet Tuesday</em>, <em>Wednesday</em>, <em>Thursday</em>, <em>Friday</em>, <em>so it’s a race covered everyday cause it’s a free bet</em>. <em>Normally I wouldn’t probably bet £10 on that race but cause its free it’s easier to</em>, <em>it’s easier to justify</em>, <em>I don’t have to justify it cause it’s their money</em>.<em>’–</em>Harry (male, PGSI score = 6)</p><p>In placing an initial qualifying bet, Harry is able to ‘earn’ a series of free bets to use on the racing festival. Through stating that these free bets will cover a race every day, it is implied that these free bets afford him the opportunity to maintain a certain frequency to his betting over the course of the festival whilst minimising his risk of losing large sums of money. Interestingly, he then states that he does not need to justify his betting behaviour when betting with free bets, suggesting an internal conflict around levels of spending which usually exists when spending actual money on gambling. So, whilst the initial suggestion from Harry is that the uptake of such offers is to cleverly reduce the financial risk associated with his gambling, a more detailed interpretation highlights how free bets alleviate his internal conflicts around levels of spending on gambling whilst continuing to actively gamble. James similarly puts forward the value in taking advantage of free bets offers to reduce financial risk, commenting upon ‘the lack of pressure’ they feel when betting with free bets. However, when questioned whether their strategy differed when betting with free bets, he explained how free bets led to making riskier gambling choices.</p><p><em>‘ I went to Aspers the casino in [RETRACTED] and they give me like a £5 free bet and</em>, <em>er</em>, <em>I remember the dealer had like a</em>, <em>I had like a four and I had 15 off my two cards and I’d usually stay</em>, <em>I wouldn’t</em>, <em>I’d just leave it but I just thought it’s £5</em>, <em>hit me again like that sort of thing so it changed my</em>, <em>my strategy</em>, <em>I lost my strategy because it was free</em>, <em>like cause I thought I’m not gonna lose like I’m never gonna lose cause like</em>, <em>and then you do lose cause you put another bet on and do the same</em>.<em>’—</em>James (male, PGSI score = 10)</p><p>The increased freedom which accompanies the lack of financial risk when using free bets allows James to take a riskier approach within his game of blackjack. However, changes to his betting strategy continue when he starts to gamble with his own money, something which he attributes to the feeling that he cannot lose whilst betting with the free bet. This indicates that emotional states that are present when betting with free bets, such as a lack of fear of losing money, can extend beyond the period in which they are using the free bet. As such, whilst the initial purpose of engaging with the marketing offer may be to reduce risk, it may result in riskier behaviour in the long term.</p><p>Most participants also discussed ways that they took advantage of gambling marketing to increase their chances of making profit when gambling, such as signing up for multiple bookmakers to take advantage of the sign-up offers, exemplified here by Daniel.</p><p><em>‘I do have accounts</em>, <em>but I don’t really use them</em>. <em>I use SkyBet as my main one</em>, <em>my go to and then probably PaddyPower’s like sort of like another one that I use but apart from them two I don’t actively bet with anybody else</em>. <em>I just used to do the join offers and see if I can like rinse</em>, <em>basically rinse them for some money and then just take off</em>, <em>off into the sunset</em>.’—Daniel (PGSI score = 3)</p><p>Despite only betting regularly with two bookmakers, Daniel has signed up to others to make profit from their sign-up offers. Such offers are thus presented as a one-time opportunity for him to exploit marketing to secure profits from bookmakers he wouldn’t normally use. This conveys the idea that sign-up marketing offers can be exploited by savvy gamblers as part of a wider gambling strategy to increase the chances of making money through gambling. David highlights a further example of this strategy, explaining how price boosted bets can increase the value of certain bets to the point where the implied probability of the odds is lower than their perceived likelihood of the event occurring.</p><p><em>‘Before I even see the odds you know like</em>, <em>I’ve got like an opinion or whatever it is but sometimes you see the odds and you think the odds are really good and then you know when you see a boost you might think</em>, <em>even if I’m not</em>, <em>even if I don’t think that’s going to happen the odds are you know</em>, <em>they sort of outweigh the sort of chance of it not happening so</em>, <em>it may make me place a bet</em>, <em>especially if I’m sort of on the</em>, <em>you know</em>, <em>on the fence on it I see better odds and I think</em>, <em>oh might as well’—</em>David (PGSI score = 9)</p><p>Through comparing his pre-conceived judgements of how likely a bet is to win against how likely the advertised odds suggest it is to win, David reaches a judgement on whether the bet represents good value. Boosted odds make bets more appealing and push him towards betting on them even if he does not think the bet is likely to win. This therefore depicts the idea that knowledgeable gamblers can search for bets where the odds are in their favour over the bookmaker to secure profit over an extended period of time.</p><h3>Theme 2: Gambling marketing as a test of self-control</h3><p>Despite the consensus amongst participants that marketing could be exploited for personal gain, there was also an agreement that marketing acted as a test of their control of their gambling behaviour. Most participants interviewed described how marketing acted as temptation or as a reminder to the gambler, with Mark stating that marketing offers draw him back into gambling after deciding to stop due to financial concerns:</p><p><em>‘I’ll get like obviously marketing</em>, <em>like I get texts off like Ladbrokes and Coral and that</em>, <em>like giving me offers and that and</em>, <em>erm</em>, <em>when I stop I sort of find it like I don’t ever get like an urge in my head to go and splash a load of money but I sort of think I</em>, <em>I’ll do that it’s just a bit of fun init and then sort of progressively gets a bit more and more like progressive’–</em>Mark, (PGSI score = 10)</p><p>It is evident that there is a disconnect between Mark’s reasons for gambling and his actual behaviour. Whilst acknowledging that his gambling behaviour escalates to levels that he feels uncomfortable with, he struggles to maintain his attempts to stop gambling due to the enjoyment he associates with the activity. Marketing is identified as something which leads him to start gambling again after choosing to stop, implying that marketing offers act as temptation by reminding him of the enjoyment that he gets from gambling. Marketing therefore plays a key role in establishing a cycle of behaviour whereby attempts to stop gambling are prevented from being successful by acting as a reminder of the perceived positive aspects of gambling. Numerous participants also discussed how the high frequency of gambling marketing within their everyday lives made it hard for them to switch off from gambling.</p><p><em>‘I think I touched on it before where they’ve got like live odds on things so if you’re busy watching a game or whatever things like that I quite often</em>, <em>erm</em>, <em>make us actually go put a bet on or at least have a look so I might not put that exact bet on but I might go have a look and see what other bets are on of like a similar ilk</em>.<em>’—</em>Connor (PGSI score = 6)</p><p>Connor explains how seeing marketing during live sport encourages him to bet, even if he is not interested in the specific bet that is being advertised. This indicates an aversion of focus when watching sport from watching for enjoyment to thinking about what bets could be placed on the game by initiating an evaluation of the advertised bet. Marketing therefore acts as a reminder to the participant of the possibility of gambling on the event that they are watching. Additionally, James discussed how marketing schemes used within casinos glamourise gambling and encourage increased spending.</p><p><em>‘Say I was on four points for the month and there was only a few days left I’d probably just want to get up to that tier because I’ve seen people who are obviously at these tiers and they make them feel like celebrities</em>, <em>like even their drinks come in a fancier glass</em>, <em>erm</em>, <em>they</em>, <em>they get a valet who’ll come and take their coat and they come over every five minutes is everything ok and you</em>, <em>your card even looks different just little things</em>, <em>like mine has just got white card and they’ll have like a matt black card and it just looks</em>, <em>it’s just the whole</em>, <em>it’s like fashion isn’t it you try and look better and then you feel more important and you spend more money</em>.<em>’—</em>James (PGSI score = 10)</p><p>James explains tiered marketing scheme whereby gamblers receive differing levels of perks based upon their levels of spending. Whilst acknowledging that such marketing schemes aim to keep the gambler spending, he states that he would be tempted to spend more money to reach the higher tiers if he could afford it due to the celebrity-like treatment that the higher tiers receive. This suggests that the temptation provided by such schemes act by playing upon perceptions of self-worth, making higher spending gamblers feel more important and elevating their social status within the gambling environment.</p><p>Despite the acknowledgment that marketing acts as temptation to gamble, most participants stated that advertising did not have any serious impacts upon their gambling behaviour. Instead, most of their concerns around marketing were related to those who they saw as having problematic personalities or who were problem gamblers. For example, in response to a question on what makes a gambler vulnerable, something he previously established as a risk factor for marketing, Tom responds that vulnerability refers to a lack of control over spending, particularly for individuals with major financial responsibilities.</p><p><em>‘Maybes someone that’s got less control over how much money they’re wanting to be putting into their gambling accounts</em>, <em>certainly I know cause obviously still living at home being a student I don’t necessarily have a lot of outgoings of my money so</em>, <em>erm</em>, <em>so maybe when I’ve got more responsibilities like a house and things like that</em>, <em>er</em>, <em>and people that are also in that situation when they maybe don’t have as much disposable income to be gambling with I think that’s when it can become a little bit more irresponsible they’re kind of targeting their adverts at people who need their money for other things</em>.<em>’—</em>Tom (PGSI score = 4)</p><p>This indicates that gambling advertising triggers those who cannot control their gambling behaviour into spending money that they cannot afford to spend. In distancing himself from such a lack of control or financial responsibilities, Tom suggests that any dangers of gambling marketing do not apply to himself. So, whilst marketing serves as temptation to gamble, the severity of the negative impacts that it can have upon behaviour depends upon individual factors to each gambler. This view is supported by Connor, who argues advertising targets individuals with addictive personalities.</p><p><em>‘I do know plenty people that have quite addictive personalities so the more that they are targeted by gambling companies the more potential there is for them to</em>, <em>er</em>, <em>to kind of succumb to that kind of demand I guess</em>, <em>erm</em>, <em>but like I say not really for me personally</em>, <em>but I definitely know people that would be sucked in by those kind of adverts</em>.<em>’–</em>Connor (PGSI score = 6)</p><p>In responding to an advert shown by the interviewer, Connor argues that the advert would not make him gamble but that he knows other people who would be drawn into betting when viewing it. The use of the metaphor ‘sucked in by those kind of adverts’ presents marketing as a trap designed to lure a specific sub-group of gamblers into gambling. Whilst this acknowledges the dangers of gambling marketing, it places the responsibility of avoiding such negative consequences on each individual gambler. Through describing the limited impact of advertising upon his own behaviour, Connor implies a superior level of self-control over his gambling behaviour compared to other people that he knows. As such, this suggests that the risks of gambling marketing only exist for those who are not in control of their behaviour and cannot resist the temptation to gamble evoked by such marketing.</p><h3>Theme 3: Safer gambling messages perceived as ineffective</h3><p>The final theme developed from the interviews covered the perception amongst most participants that safer gambling messages lack effectiveness. Concerns were expressed over the content of safer gambling messages, both in terms of the lack of useful information and the uneven balance between prompting people to gamble and promoting safer gambling. For example, Harry discussed how current safer gambling messages within marketing campaigns fail to provide gamblers with the relevant information to reduce the risk associated with their gambling behaviour.</p><p><em>‘There isn’t many promoted ways of safer gambling</em>, <em>it’s just like when you stop having fun stop betting but there isn’t like a</em>, <em>this is a way of trying to reduce your risk and like if you’ve got an addiction how to help yourself without having to go through all that</em>, <em>there isn’t really much guidance on starting safe and not waiting until you’re five-thousand pound in debt to try and become safe</em>.<em>’</em>—Harry (PGSI score = 6)</p><p>Harry discusses how the ‘when the fun stops stop’ safer gambling slogan lacks effectiveness due to an absence of practical application. In highlighting examples where more focused and informative safer gambling advice would be useful for gamblers, this emphasises that the complexity of promoting safer gambling cannot be covered by one uniform slogan. This is because the advice needed for someone beginning to gamble is completely different from the help needed for someone who is experiencing harm from gambling. Building upon this, Chris highlighted the lack of focus on safer gambling with gambling marketing.</p><p><em>‘I feel like the whole safe gambling’s just</em>, <em>erm</em>, <em>a bit of like a bit of a blanket over it all sort of thing</em>, <em>like you can easily just rub it off straight away and you wouldn’t notice that it wasn’t there like</em>, <em>I mean the gamble responsibly bit on the end of the advert I</em>, <em>I think you’ve already targeted someone by giving the odds or the boost or something in the advert I think with that at the end of it you’ve already hooked them—</em>Chris (PGSI score = 8)</p><p>Chris describes how he sees safer gambling messages within marketing as ineffective as they are usually incorporated at the end of an advert, after the company has advertised an appealing bet or offer. Safer gambling messaging within marketing are therefore seen as an afterthought and, as such, he pays little attention to it. Taken together, both previous extracts highlight that gamblers struggle to connect with safer gambling messages due to the way safer gambling content is included within marketing campaigns. Additionally, there were also concerns as to the sincerity of safer gambling messages within marketing from gambling operators.</p><p><em>‘I’m not necessarily sure it’s the best message coming from the people that are producing it themselves</em>. <em>I think it should be more like a government thing if</em>, <em>or actually made into a law or something like that</em>, <em>erm</em>, <em>because it’s so accessible and it just seems mad if the people that are running are it are necessarily the ones responsible</em>, <em>I dunno it’s a bit like if you were making sweets why should</em>, <em>you’re not really gonna decide that you’re gonna add less sugar or something like that I don’t know I just</em>, <em>it doesn’t seem necessarily like it’s the right people to be making a decision on it when they’re gonna be biased about it anyway</em>.<em>’—</em>Charlotte (PGSI score = 2)</p><p>Charlotte expresses concern over gambling operators including safer gambling content within their marketing, instead stating a preference for information to come from a less biased source. This indicates a lack of trust in gambling operators to provide useful safer gambling advice, since they stand to financially benefit from riskier gambling behaviour. It also implies that the effectiveness of messages used is further limited by the very fact they are viewed as a biased source. Essentially, if they do not believe that operators want their customers to gamble in a safe and controlled manner, then they will not follow any safer gambling advice given within their marketing.</p><p>Another way that safer gambling messages lacked effectiveness was the common misconception that safer gambling is a reactionary measure aimed at helping those who are addicted, rather than a general principle for all gamblers to follow. For example, Connor argues safer gambling adverts are ineffective as they won’t help those who are addicted.</p><p><em>‘I think that people with the problem are the people that are addicted so you’ve got to tackle</em>, <em>I feel like the solution has got to be a bit more of a harder one I mean like yes you can relate to those things and but like just because a pundit said you shouldn’t make a</em>, <em>put a bet on because you’ve lost the last</em>, <em>you’re on a losing streak or whatever</em>, <em>it doesn’t really make it</em>, <em>especially that one where it’s saying don’t bet when you’re drunk but it</em>, <em>when you’re drunk you’ve got less control anyways so whether that’s at the forefront of your mind I’m not really sure</em>, <em>er</em>, <em>I’m not really sure that it works at all to be honest</em>.<em>’—</em>Connor (PGSI score = 6)</p><p>In framing their response to the question of the advert’s effectiveness in relation to how it may impact individuals experiencing gambling problems, Connor implies that the purpose of these adverts is to get disordered gamblers to identify and change their problematic behaviour. As such, safer gambling messages are seen as irrelevant for those who do not identify their behaviour as problematic as they do not feel the need to change their behaviour.</p><h2>Discussion</h2><h3>Contribution to existing theory and literature</h3><p>The current findings supported a recently published interview study which also investigated sports bettors’ perceptions of gambling marketing within Great Britain [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>], in that marketing offers were seen to reduce risk. However, whilst that study explained how gambling promotions decreased feelings of risk associated with a particular bet, the current study highlights how gamblers feel as though they can carefully take advantage of marketing offers to reduce the overall risk associated with their gambling behaviour. A deeper interpretation of the data highlighted how this reduction of risk appears to alleviate internal conflicts around the frequency of gambling behaviour. Such an internal conflict can be seen as an example of cognitive dissonance [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>], whereby the frequency of their gambling behaviour may differ from their perception of what a ‘safe’ frequency of gambling is. Therefore, engaging with marketing offers to reduce risk may allow gamblers to employ a form of internal self-justification, whereby attitudes are altered to make negative consequences seem more tolerable and reduce states of cognitive dissonance [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>].</p><p>It was also highlighted that participants viewed certain types of marketing as being free of risk and therefore allowing greater freedom to choose bets with longer odds. This finding is supported by experimental research that found that participants chose significantly larger odds when a betting incentive was offered [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. Interestingly, it was suggested that free bet offers can lead to continued choices of longer odds bets due to emotional states extending beyond the use of the inducement. This may be explained by research which has demonstrated a relationship between the value of expected winnings and subjective measures of excitement, as well as increased heart rates [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>]. Therefore, if individuals experience the excitement of larger potential winnings, this may encourage them to choose such bets again in the future. This highlights how the intended use of marketing offers may not always align with the outcomes of interacting with such offers. Whilst gamblers may think of marketing as a tool by which they can reduce their risk, it may lead to riskier behaviour over a longer time period due to the increased volatility of bets with higher odds.</p><p>A further way in which gamblers reported taking advantage of marketing within the study was through making judgements as to when offers increased the value of bets. One participant discussed how some offers can boost the odds of bets to odds which give a lower implied probability than his perceived likelihood of the bet winning. Such a finding aligns with a recent systematic review which concluded that sports bettors attributed more importance to skill than luck in the outcomes of betting [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>]. The current study builds upon these findings to highlight how such perceptions of gambling as a skilled activity can impact how gamblers interact with marketing offers. This is a concern as the same review found that sports bettors perform no better with their choices of bets than random selection [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>]. Additionally, sports bettors have been found to overestimate the probability of more complex bets often included in marketing offers [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. So, whilst bettors may think of marketing as something which can be exploited for financial gain, this may not always be possible due to an overestimation of their own skill. Additionally, sports betting adverts use a dual persuasion strategy, to enhance perceived control and reduce perceived risk [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>]. The findings of the current study suggest that such persuasion strategies are successful as they are reflected within the way gamblers think about gambling marketing.</p><p>Participants within the study acknowledged the risk associated with gambling marketing. A number of participants discussed how marketing drew them back into gambling after a period of abstinence, suggesting marketing acted as challenge to maintaining a change in behaviour. For example, one participant described how marketing reminded him of the enjoyment he would get from gambling after choosing to not gamble for a while and another discussed trying to actively avoid marketing during periods they were uncomfortable with their own gambling behaviour. Previous qualitative research found similar findings in that gambling adverts acted as a reminder to gamble and initiated gambling sessions [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref045\" class=\"ref-tip\">45</a>], however this finding this was mainly amongst treatment-seeking disordered gamblers whereas nobody in the current study had a diagnosis of gambling disorder. Taken together, these findings highlight how marketing is perceived to prevent sustained behaviour change across the spectrum of gambling-related harm.</p><p>One potential theoretical explanation as to why marketing may prevent gamblers from maintaining behaviour change relates to the role of self-efficacy in leading models of behaviour change, such as the Transtheoretical Model [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref046\" class=\"ref-tip\">46</a>] and the Theory of Planned Behaviour [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref047\" class=\"ref-tip\">47</a>]. Both models argue that, for behaviour change to be successful, individuals must believe themselves capable of maintaining such a change. Within the Transtheoretical Model specifically, it is argued that behaviour change is often unsuccessful when feelings of temptation outweigh an individual’s confidence in their ability to maintain a behaviour. Therefore, seeing gambling marketing may increase temptation to gamble above an individual’s level of self-efficacy, prompting them to start gambling again. This is particularly relevant given that research has shown that advertisements include perceived control enhancing content [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>]. Self-efficacy may therefore be an inducement to gamble when the efficacy is linked to a gambling outcome yet can act as a preventative factor when efficacy is linked to the ability to avoid temptation.</p><p>Alternatively, the Theory of Planned Behaviour suggests that self-efficacy is just one important element of engaging in a particular behaviour. Subjective norms, the extent to which an individual believes others approve of a behaviour, and an individual’s own attitudes towards a behaviour are also important in producing behavioural intentions. Given that gambling marketing has been highlighted as a major factor in normalising gambling within society [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>], and that gambling is often presented positively in marketing, this could act to lower the desire to maintain changes in behaviour by increasing positive attitudes towards gambling. In addition to this, gambling in response to marketing may be considered a form of reminder impulse purchasing [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref048\" class=\"ref-tip\">48</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref049\" class=\"ref-tip\">49</a>] and a recent meta-analysis highlighted a link between positive emotions and increased impulse purchasing [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref050\" class=\"ref-tip\">50</a>]. So, marketing which aims to increase positive feelings towards gambling may not only lower desire to maintain changes in gambling behaviour but also increase the temptation to engage within impulse purchasing.</p><p>However, despite acknowledging the risks associated with gambling marketing, participants described marketing as only being a serious problem for those with a diagnosis of gambling disorder or with a specific type of personality. An explanation for such an argument is the third-person effect, which refers to an individual’s belief that mass media messages have a larger impact on others than themselves [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref051\" class=\"ref-tip\">51</a>]. However, given that participants were keen to stress the rationality of their behaviour in comparison to the perceived vulnerabilities of specific types of people, their explanation moves beyond the third-person effect. By distancing themselves from any harm arising from gambling marketing, participants can protect a positive identity and stress rationality and self-control as markers of positive identity in contrast to disordered gamblers. One possible explanation for this is that it is an example of a fundamental attribution error [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref052\" class=\"ref-tip\">52</a>], whereby individuals over-emphasise personality characteristics over situational explanations when explaining the behaviour of others.</p><p>Alternatively, if this distinction between their behaviour and others’ behaviour is more intentional, this could be seen as being rooted in Social Identity Theory [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref053\" class=\"ref-tip\">53</a>]. This theory argues individuals attribute negative characteristics to an out-group, in this case ‘vulnerable gamblers’, in order to enhance their own self-image. Such categorisation of gamblers into two distinct subgroups of ‘safe’ and ‘vulnerable’ gamblers can be seen as a reflection of the narrative around individual control which is often supported by the gambling industry [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref054\" class=\"ref-tip\">54</a>]. This is a concern since gambling does not only harm those with a diagnosis of gambling disorder [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>]. Also, research has found that certain aspects of gambling marketing led to riskier behaviour regardless of disordered gambling category [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. So, despite thinking of marketing as something which only has a negative impact on others who cannot control their gambling, this may not accurately reflect the impact marketing has on gamblers’ behaviour.</p><p>The issue of identity is also relevant within the finding that safer gambling messages incorporated into gambling marketing are perceived to be largely ineffective. One reason for this was the perception of safer gambling as a reactionary measure aimed at helping those who are disordered gamblers. If gamblers are motivated to maintain a positive identity of being a safe gambler, then safer gambling messages are not going to be perceived as being relevant due to targeting the wrong identity. Participants also expressed concerns over the sincerity of industry-led safer gambling messages due to the concept of safer gambling not aligning with their financial interests as a business. There were also concerns around their sincerity due to these messages usually being included as an afterthought within advertisements of gambling products and are their infrequency in comparison to gambling adverts. It is argued that source credibility, which incorporates both trustworthiness and expertise, is a key factor in whether health messages are accepted by their target population [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref055\" class=\"ref-tip\">55</a>]. Thus, if gamblers perceive that the gambling industry is not a trustworthy source to deliver safer gambling messages then they will not accept or process the content of the messages.</p><h3>Methodological considerations and evaluation</h3><p>One key methodological consideration of using IPA is to purposively recruit a homogenous sample [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. The current study achieved this by recruiting in the age range that most frequently report gambling in response to marketing [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>] and who gambled frequently but did not have a diagnosis of gambling disorder. Such levels of homogeneity within the sample is a strength of the study and help addressed previously discussed limitations in the research area. This is important given the large number of individuals who meet the criteria for being at-risk gamblers within Great Britain [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref056\" class=\"ref-tip\">56</a>]. However, an inherent limitation of such a sampling approach means you may not pick up on important experiences of the phenomena in other relevant demographics. For example, the sample recruited was largely white-British, male, undergraduate students and between the ages of 18 and 23. In particular, those aged 24 to 34 are also included in the age category of those who gamble most in response to gambling marketing and are likely to be more experienced gamblers than their younger counterparts. Therefore, the current study may have missed some valuable experiences of how these bettors think about gambling marketing. Further qualitative research should explore how other demographic groups think about gambling marketing.</p><p>A further criticism often made of IPA as a methodology is that is overly subjective and therefore unscientific [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref057\" class=\"ref-tip\">57</a>]. However, such levels of interpretation are actively encouraged within IPA as a means of exploring feelings, emotions, and meanings [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>]. Additionally, care was taken to ensure transparency around the analysis process through documenting the different stages of the analysis (<a href=\"https://osf.io/utzds/\">https://osf.io/utzds/</a>). Whilst the lack of member checking may be considered a limitation of the current study, credibility of the analysis was instead strengthened through a second researcher (GP), who was unfamiliar with gambling research, reviewing the analysis to ensure that findings were grounded in the experiences of participants.</p><h3>Future research suggestions</h3><p>Given the perceived lack of effectiveness of current safer gambling strategies identified here, future research should explore the impact of new safer gambling strategies upon gambling behaviour. For example, concerns were highlighted about both the sincerity and placement of safer gambling messages within marketing. Therefore, future research should assess the impact of safer gambling messages from impartial sources and messages presented separately from gambling marketing. There has also been recent research showing how pictograms increased the perceived risk associated with the products and improved discrimination of risk between products [<a href=\"#pone.0287393.ref058\" class=\"ref-tip\">58</a>]. Future studies should therefore test the impact of including these types of images within gambling marketing to improve risk perception, however there should also be an assessment on whether this directly impacts upon gambling behaviour.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The current study aimed to explore how frequent gamblers think about gambling marketing and the impact it has upon behaviour. Participants disclosed that marketing was something that they felt they could exploit for their own personal gain, either through increasing the value of bets or by reducing the risk associated with betting. However, they also acknowledged that marketing acted as a test of their own self-control by tempting them to bet in situations where they had not planned on doing so. Despite this, participants were keen to stress that marketing had little serious impact upon their behaviour and that marketing was only a risk factor for other people who were seen to be more vulnerable to developing disordered gambling. Finally, participants saw safer gambling messages within marketing as being ineffective due to the perceived insincerity of incorporating safer gambling content withing gambling advertisements. These findings highlight the need for improved safer gambling strategies that move beyond individual responsibility. A public health approach to reducing gambling-harm should focus on eliminating control-enhancing aspects of gambling marketing and products, such as free bets and money-back offers. There should also be a rethink on the use of safer gambling messaging within marketing as it requires an evaluation of perceived risk amongst gamblers. Therefore, such messages appear to miss their intended audience if perceived risk does not align with objective levels of risk.</p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>Firstly, we would like the thank the participants in this study for so kindly sharing their personal experiences during the interview process.

Here, in four studies, we test this four-factor model using the 33-item Modes of Relationships Questionnaire (MORQ). In Study 1, we administered the MORQ to N = 347 subjects. A parallel analysis supported the four-factor structure, but several items failed to load on their predicted target factors. In Study 2 (N = 617), we developed a well-fitting four-factor model of the MORQ with a total of 20 items (five items retained for each factor). This model replicated across multiple relationships reported by each subject. In Study 3, we replicated the model in an independent dataset (N = 615). A general factor associated with relationship type was required in both Study 2 and Study 3. In Study 4, we tested the nature of this general factor, finding that it was associated with the closeness of the relationship. The results support the Relational Models four-factor structure of social relationships. Given the mature theory and applications in a wide range of disciplines, from social to organisational psychology, we hope that this compact, valid, and interpretable instrument leads to increased usage of the scale.</p><p><strong>Citation: </strong>Zakharin M, Bates TC (2023) Relational models theory: Validation and replication for four fundamental relationships.

The theory proposes that relationships are represented and processed within four underlying psychological models: Communal Sharing, Equality Matching, Authority Ranking and Market Pricing. A measure of these models–the Modes of Relationships Questionnaire (MORQ) [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>]–has been developed, permitting testing of the theory. Analyses of the MORQ, however, have found a poor fit to the theorised four-factor model [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>]. In the present paper, we set out to locate the cause of this poor fit, generate a well-fitting model, and establish the replicability of the newly proposed model. Below, we briefly introduce the RMT and the questionnaire associated with it.</p><p>Based on ethnographic fieldwork and a review of previous studies, Fiske [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>] proposed four distinct relational systems constituting the structures of social relationships. These four models are theorised as fundamental and innate and serve as a comprehensive framework to describe all possible human relationships [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>]. They depict how individuals evaluate their status in relation to others and elucidate appropriate or inappropriate behaviours in a given social context. In essence, they offer a framework for comprehending social interactions and the expected norms of behaviour in diverse social settings. The first of these models, <em>Communal Sharing</em> (CS), focuses on what people have in common and is exemplified in relationships where people share an identity with others, such as family, tribe, religion, or ethnic group, resulting in mutual recognition of social equivalence of individuals. This shared identity is reflected in helping others regardless of their past contributions, treating the property as communal, and making joint consensus-based decisions. The second relational model is <em>Equality Matching</em> (EM), in which individuals treat each other as distinct but equal partners. In EM relationships, work inputs and outputs are divided equally where possible. Where resources and work are not divisible equally, individuals keep a count of what they give and receive and equalise this over time. Examples of this relationship include mutual credit organisations and babysitting co-ops. EM also extends to vengeful behaviour, such as eye-for-an-eye justice [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. The third model, <em>Authority Ranking</em> (AR), implements a hierarchy system in which social interactions are based on recognising and respecting different levels of authority. The distribution of resources in this model is expected to be unequal, with superiors feeling entitled to a larger share of resources and subordinates accepting this division as fair [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. A range of factors can influence ranking in an AR, including age, gender, seniority, and achievement. One example of this model would be the relationship between employer and employee. The fourth and final relational model in RMT is <em>Market Pricing</em> (MP). The MP model suggests that people relate to each other based on the value they exchange in a relationship as if it were a market transaction. According to this model, individuals perceive their relationships as a means to obtain desired resources, assistance, or support from the other person. Examples of relationships that align with this model include commercial partnerships, where transactions are prominent, as well as cultural constructs like the concepts of price, wages, or dividends.</p><p>While these four models are conceptualised as distinct, RMT predicts that a given human relationship typically reflects combinations of two or more relational models. For example, relationships within a family context usually emphasise the CS relationship. However, children within a family may also be expected to respect their parents (AR relationship), do their fair share of chores (EM relationship) and, perhaps, to be paid for doing some of them (MP relationship).</p><p>A substantial amount of empirical research has demonstrated that relational models can accurately predict significant outcomes. For instance, Vodosek [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>] found that horizontal collectivism was associated with equality matching and communal sharing relationships, whereas vertical individualism was related to a preference for authority ranking, and vertical collectivism was related to a preference for authority ranking and communal sharing. Biber et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>] investigated the relationship between relational models and universal human values [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>]. They found that individuals who prioritise CS relationships place greater importance on benevolence and universalism values while placing less emphasis on power and achievement. Conversely, those who value AR or MP relationships tend to prioritise power and achievement values over benevolence and universalism. A disparity between anticipated and real relationship models resulted in a sense of inequity among employees at work [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>], and they began to view their supervisors as lacking morals [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. In clinical samples, different diagnoses were linked to either difficulties or extreme use of specific relational models [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>]. For instance, dysthymia was found to be positively associated with high levels of AR relationships with close friends and family members, while hypomania was positively associated with high levels of CS and EM relationships with authority figures.</p><h3>Updates and applications of RMT</h3><p>Other models of social relations have been developed both before and since the innovations of RMT. Perhaps the key feature distinguishing RMT from theories of social relationships, such as interdependence theory [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>], attachment theory [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>] and social identity theory [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>] is the emphasis RMT places on explaining the underlying structure of relationships. Rather than focusing on the role of interdependence within relationships, emotional bonds formed early in life or the sense of self derived from a social group membership, RMT provides a framework for understanding social interactions and the appropriate behaviours within them.</p><p>RMT has continued to evolve and expand its realm of application, with several changes being of particular relevance. First, a personality assessment tool–the Relationship Profile Scale [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>], was developed to evaluate individual preferences for distinct relational models, measuring the perceived importance, satisfaction, challenges, and motivations associated with each of the four relational models. Together with the MORQ, the Relationship Profile Scale enables a comparison of individuals’ desired and actual relationship experiences. A significant theoretical advance known as Relationship Regulation Theory [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>] extended RMT into the domain of moral psychology by associating each relational model with four distinct moral motives. For instance, the moral motive of hierarchy is based on the AR relationship and its focus on establishing and upholding a clear ranking in social groups. The motive of hierarchy motivates those in lower positions to show respect, obedience, and deference to those above them, including leaders, ancestors, or gods, and to punish those who go against them. Conversely, those in higher positions feel a moral responsibility to guide, direct, and safeguard those below them. This expansion links RMT to existing moral theories [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>] but construes the nature of moral behaviour as relationship management and emphasises that the moral value of acts such as harming, unequal treatment, or being impure are dependent on the relationships and relational models within which they are deployed.</p><p>Most recently, RMT has undergone another significant enhancement by incorporating the well-established effects of incentives on behaviour into our understanding of relationships and relationship management. Known as Relational Incentives Theory [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>], this extension posits that for incentives to be effective, they should align with relational models. For instance, incentives promoting communal sharing relations should be most effective when they align with the motive of unity, while proportional incentive schemes work best for market pricing relations. These recent advancements demonstrate the continued significance of RMT and highlight the crucial role of the four relational models in comprehending and predicting diverse behaviours, ranging from resolving moral disagreements to determining the efficacy of incentive schemes.</p><h3>Measuring relational models</h3><p>Realising the benefits of an instrument to test the predictions of RMT, Haslam and Fiske [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>] developed the Modes of Relationships Questionnaire (MORQ), a 33-item instrument to measure the four social relationships specified in RMT. For each relationship, items were constructed to tap into each of eight classes of behaviour predicted to be influenced by social relationships: 1) distribution and use of resources, 2) work, 3) morals, 4) exchange, 5) decision-making, 6) social influence, and 7) identity, with an eighth “miscellaneous” category reserved for behaviours specific to each particular relationship mode. The EM relationship has two items in this miscellaneous category.</p><p>The MORQ has a slightly unusual administration process. Participants first generate a list of relationships they have with others, typically 40, from which 10 are selected randomly to avoid oversampling easier-to-recall relationships. They then rate each relationship on each of the 33 MORQ items. This creates data in which information from each participant generates correlated information on multiple target individuals. Between-participant variance is statistically removed to compensate for the dependency amongst responses so that the data analysed consisted of each participant’s deviation from their own mean rating across all items.</p><p>During the initial study, Haslam and Fiske [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>] administered the questionnaire to 42 participants. Three theorised models were compared (see <a href=\"#pone-0287391-g001\">Fig 1</a>): a) A two-factor model consisting of orthogonal bipolar dimensions, one running from EM to AR and one from CS to MP, thus capturing the equality-inequality and closeness-distance dimensions; b) A four-factor orthogonal and c) A four-factor oblique model. Confirmatory factor analyses preferred the four oblique factor model over the two other models [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>]. However, the absolute fit of this four-factor model was well below the accepted criteria (GFI = .75, RMSEA = .243).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec1.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec1.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>a) 2-factor Bipolar Model, b) 4-factor Orthogonal Model and c) 4-factor Oblique Model.</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287391.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287391.g001</a></p><p>Since this initial report, only a few studies have assessed the psychometric properties of the MORQ. Brito and colleagues [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>] evaluated the four-factor structure of the MORQ in a sample of 63 Portuguese participants confirming that the fit metrics of the model were unsatisfactory (GFI = .74, RMSEA = .092). Vodosek [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>] selected a different 22-item set from the 33-item MORQ, administered these to a US sample (N = 465), and tested the fit of a four-factor model. However, even this reduced set of items did not fit a four-factor model well (CFI = .80, GFI = .83, RMSEA = .07). In this study, however, participants were asked to indicate the degree to which they believed each MORQ statement should be true in an ideal working group, rather than rating their actual relationships. This difference in approach may account for the low level of fit observed. Finally, Bogodistov and Lizneva (5) used the MORQ with a Ukrainian sample of 99 metallurgical workers. They modelled three of the four scales, excluding EM (based on poor reliability) and also excluded 11 items from the remaining three scales based on low factor loadings, leaving a total of six items on the AR scale, four items on the CS scale and three items on the MP scale. A structural model of these items representing only 13 items and three factors showed a good model fit (CFI = .963, RMSEA = .058).</p><p>These previous attempts to model the MORQ suggest that some items have low validity (based on low factor loadings). They were also hampered by small samples, lacking the power to detect item structure reliably. Given the lack of fit for the simple four-factor models tested, it may also be that more complex structural models are needed to account for variance in the MORQ. Previous research, therefore, cannot be interpreted as rejecting the RMT but rather suggests the need for additional research and modelling. To advance the literature, we conducted four studies addressing these shortcomings.</p><h2>Study 1a</h2><p>In Study 1a, we used structural equation modelling to test the fit of the four-factor model (see <a href=\"#pone-0287391-g001\">Fig 1C</a>) proposed by Haslam and Fiske [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>] in a large sample. Confirming that the model fits poorly, we then attempted to improve the model in a smaller set of items, retained based on high factor loadings suggested by factor analysis.</p><h3>Method</h3><h4>Participants.</h4><p>A total of 347 United Kingdom residents (228 women, 118 men, 1 other; mean age 33.96 years, SD = 13.44) were recruited using Prolific Academic, an online research-recruiting system. The data were collected in April-May 2021. The study was approved by the University of Edinburgh PPLS Research Ethics Committee.</p><h4>Measures.</h4><p>Relational models were assessed using the MORQ [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>]. This instrument assesses the CS model (eight items, e.g., “<em>If either of you needs something</em>, <em>the other gives it without expecting anything in return</em>”); EM (nine items, e.g., “<em>If you have work to do</em>, <em>you usually split it evenly</em>”); AR (eight items, e.g., “<em>One of you is entitled to more than the other</em>”); and MP (eight items, e.g., “<em>What you get from this person is directly proportional to how much you give them</em>”).</p><h4>Procedure.</h4><p>Testing was done using the Qualtrics online survey platform. Before starting the study, participants received an explanation of the study and were asked to provide written consent by signing a consent form. After giving informed consent, each participant was asked to identify 40 people with whom they interacted at any closeness level, regardless of how superficially or infrequently, giving a memorable name for each. An automated branching logic in the questionnaire randomly selected one of these names, and the subject was prompted to complete the MORQ, rating this selected relationship. In order to increase the sample size and, consequently, the reliability of the study, each participant was asked to identify 40 relationships but to rate only one of these relationships instead of ten as in the original study [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>]. Total testing took approximately 9 minutes per participant on average. All data were de-identified and collected using Prolific IDs to protect participants’ privacy. No personally identifying information was collected and the authors did not have access to information that could identify individual participants during or after data collection. For privacy, Prolific IDs have been anonymised and replaced with numerical IDs in the open data associated with this manuscript.</p><p>Model fit was assessed using the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). The RMSEA evaluates the deviation of a hypothesised model from an ideal one. It ranges between 0 and 1, with values closer to zero indicating a better fit. In contrast, the CFI and TLI compare the fit of a hypothesised model to that of a baseline model, which assumes no correlation between any underlying continuous variables. Higher values, closer to 1.0, indicate a better fit for CFI and TLI. Following Hu &amp; Bentler [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>] and Yu [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>], we adopted criteria of TLI and CFI &gt; = .95 and RMSEA &lt; = .06. The comparative fit of the models was assessed by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>], which penalises un-parsimonious models. All statistical analyses were completed in R [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>] and umx [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>].</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Descriptive statistics and Cronbach’s alpha coefficients for the four relational models are given in <a href=\"#pone-0287391-t001\">Table 1</a>. Cronbach’s alphas ranged from 0.72 to 0.86 suggesting good internal consistency of the four scales.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287391.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287391.t001</a></p><p>We first tested the best-fitting model of the MORQ presented by Haslam and Fiske [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>], consisting of four factors with items loading only on their corresponding factor and the factors themselves permitted to correlate. This model had unsatisfactory fit, χ<sup>2</sup> (489) = 1563.59, p &lt; 0.001; CFI = 0.738; TLI = 0.717; RMSEA = 0.08.</p><p>To explore the cause of this lack of fit, we conducted a parallel analysis [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>] followed by an exploratory factor analysis using a promax (oblique) rotation. The parallel analysis supported a four-factor structure, with the first four factors accounting for 11.3%, 9.8%, 9.1% and 7.7% of the variance in MORQ scores, respectively. The exploratory factor analysis extracting four factors indicated some likely problems. Eight items had a larger loading on a factor other than that they intended to assess. Ten items had cross-loadings over .30, suggesting that they measured more than just one relational model.</p><p>Based on this factor analytic evidence and on previous studies indicating that some items in the MORQ loaded poorly on their target factor [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>], we attempted to create an abbreviated 12-item scale (three items per factor to identify the model). Our selection criteria were high (&gt; .50) loadings on their target factor and low off-factor loadings (&lt; .20). Twelve items meeting these criteria were found which supported a well-fitting model, albeit in the same data set in which they had been discovered (χ<sup>2</sup> (48) = 107.53, p &lt; 0.001; CFI = 0.943; TLI = 0.922; RMSEA = 0.06).</p><h2>Study 1b</h2><p>As the analyses of Study 1a were exploratory and therefore prone to yield unreplicable results [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>], we attempted to replicate the final model in an independent dataset. In order to permit control of between-participant variance, we also asked participants in this new sample to rate ten individuals as in Haslam and Fiske [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>], rather than just a single target individual, as we had done in Study 1a.</p><h3>Method</h3><h4>Participants.</h4><p>A total of 135 United Kingdom residents (100 women, 33 men, 2 other; mean age 35.74 years, SD = 14.27) were recruited using Prolific Academic, an online research-recruiting system.</p><p>The data were collected in May 2021. The study was approved by the University of Edinburgh PPLS Research Ethics Committee.</p><h4>Measures and procedure.</h4><p>Relationships were assessed using 12 MORQ items selected in Study 1a. Testing was done using Qualtrics online survey platform. Before starting the study, participants received an explanation of the study and were asked to provide written consent by signing a consent form. As in Study 1a, each participant identified 40 people with whom they interacted at any level, giving a memorable name to each. An automated branching logic in the questionnaire then randomly selected ten of these names. The subject was then prompted to complete the 12-item version of the MORQ, rating each of the selected relationships. Total testing took approximately 13 minutes per participant on average. All data were de-identified and collected using anonymous codes to protect participants’ privacy. No personal identifying information was collected, and the authors did not have access to any information that could identify individual participants during or after data collection.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Before conducting inferential analyses, following Haslam and Fiske [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>], the impact of reporter-specific variance in the multiple target reports from each subject was controlled. Where Haslam and Fiske accomplished this by dummy coding the participant IDs and residualising the data for these dummy variables, we accomplished the same purpose in a multi-level analysis, with participant ID as a random variable, again retaining the unstandardised residuals.</p><p>We assessed the fit of the four correlated factor 12-item model developed in Study 1a. Unfortunately, the model fit poorly in this new sample (χ<sup>2</sup> (48) = 520.73, p &lt; 0.001; CFI = 0.902; TLI = 0.865; RMSEA = 0.086), indicating a failure of replication.</p><h3>Discussion of Study 1a and 1b</h3><p>The aim of studies 1a and 1b was to test if a well-fitting model of the MORQ was possible and if this reliably supported the RMT. While a factor analysis supported evidence for four factors in the MORQ, it also showed that a substantial number of items either failed to load on their corresponding factor or showed large cross-loadings on other factors. While we could identify 12 items from this analysis such that three items were available for each predicted relationship model and fitted a 4-factor model, this model failed to replicate in an independent sample. Two possible accounts for this present themselves. First, the theoretical four-factor structure may be valid, but perhaps because of a small discovery sample, we were unable to select items which reliably assess this true structure, and instead, our item selection capitalised on sample-specific variance. Alternatively, the model replication may have failed because the four-factor structure itself is incorrect or incomplete. For example, it may be necessary to replace correlations between factors with a general relationship factor, representing a general tendency to initiate or avoid relationships with other people or to make some other model modifications. To address these possibilities, we conducted a second study with a larger discovery sample, tested a wider range of models in this sample, and requested five rather than one relationship from each participant, allowing us to validate the models across a range of participant responses.</p><h2>Study 2: Alternate models and larger sample</h2><p>Study 1 failed to find the well-fitting replicable structure of the MORQ. Although factor analysis indicated that four factors are needed to explain the variance in the scale, several items failed to load on the expected factors. Post-hoc 12-item model based on items that factor analysis suggested should be retained as relatively pure indicators of each of the four domains also failed to replicate. To address the Study 1 problems, in Study 2, we collected a larger sample and used a multi-trait multi-method approach to develop a well-fitting model of the MORQ and to test if this new model replicates well.</p><h3>Method</h3><h4>Participants.</h4><p>A total of 617 people (309 women, 304 men, 4 other; mean age 39.00, SD = 14.39) from the United Kingdom were recruited using Prolific Academic. The data were collected in January-February 2022. The study was approved by the University of Edinburgh PPLS Research Ethics Committee.</p><h4>Measures and procedure.</h4><p>Participants’ endorsement of relational models was measured using the full 33-item Modes of Relationships Questionnaire (MORQ) [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>]. The questionnaire was hosted on the Qualtrics survey platform. Before starting the study, participants received an explanation of the study and were asked to provide written consent by signing a consent form. After providing informed consent, each participant generated a list of 40 relationships. Qualtrics automation was then used to select five relationships at random, and for each of these, the subject was asked to complete the online MORQ with respect to this relationship. Total testing took approximately 19 minutes per participant on average. All data were de-identified and collected using anonymous codes to protect participants’ privacy. No personal identifying information was collected, and the authors did not have access to any information that could identify individual participants during or after data collection.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Descriptive statistics and Cronbach’s alpha coefficients for the four relational models are given in <a href=\"#pone-0287391-t002\">Table 2</a>. Cronbach’s alphas ranged from 0.74 to 0.87 suggesting good internal consistency of the four scales.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287391.t002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287391.t002</a></p><p>To generate our model of the MORQ, we used only the first relationship (out of five reported by the participants), treating the remaining four relationships as internal hold-out replication datasets. Our initial model used a four-factor intercorrelated structure. To explore which, if any, sets of items would permit fit this structural model, we used a function designed to select the best items while keeping the factor structure intact. Procedurally, the function removed items one by one, starting from those that fit the model least well. This item removal process continued until the model reached a satisfactory model fit by at least two out of three criteria (CFI and TLI &gt; = .95; RMSEA &lt; = .06) [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>]. The function is documented in the OSF site for this paper.</p><p>The automatic function removed four items from each of the EM, CS, and MP scales and three items from the AR scale, yielding a model which achieved a good fit in the test dataset but which did not replicate perfectly in the hold-out relationship datasets (see <a href=\"#pone-0287391-t003\">Table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287391.t003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287391.t003</a></p><p>While the drop-off was not substantial, we wished to investigate whether more complex models would reliably yield a good fit. Based on evidence that the four relational models are typically correlated [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>], we tested the effect of removing the intercorrelations among the factors and instead modelling item covariance via a general factor loading on all items to the model. Examining the sources of a model misfit in earlier analyses also suggested a unique bivariate link between the CS and EM factors, which was added. Applying the same automated function to this new model supported this modification. A total of four EM and three CS, MP, and AR items were dropped, yielding a model with five indicators of each relational factor and resulting in a well-fitting model (χ<sup>2</sup> (149) = 990.79, p &lt; 0.001; CFI = 0.956; TLI = 0.944; RMSEA = 0.044) which also replicated well across the holdout datasets. The RMSEA remained below the threshold in all tests while other fit indices improved or decreased in proportion as compared to the fit obtained in the initial data (see <a href=\"#pone-0287391-t004\">Table 4</a>). <a href=\"#pone-0287391-g002\">Fig 2</a> shows the final model (using the dataset with all five relationships combined after controlling for between-subject variance).

We also found that the model required a general factor loading on all items, which was not investigated in previous studies relying on factor correlations only. This model performed satisfactorily across holdout data from the same dataset, providing additional support for the validity of the four-factor MORQ model. One limitation of our study, however, is that the same participants generated both the discovery (the first reported relationship) and replication (the second to the fifth reported relationship) data. While the model replicated in the different target data provided by our subjects, we wished to replicate the model in a completely independent dataset to further corroborate the new model. We, therefore, conducted Study 3, testing the exact final model from Study 2 in a new dataset.</p><h2>Study 3</h2><p>Our objective in Study 3 was to validate the 20-item model developed in Study 2 by replicating the results in an independent sample. We made no changes to the model, and the measures were identical to those used in Study 2. We expected to confirm the model structure using the same fit metrics as in Study 2 (TLI, CFI and RMSEA) and refine the model if needed.</p><h3>Method</h3><h4>Participants.</h4><p>A total of 615 people (307 women, 305 men, 3 other; mean age = 41.57, SD = 13.97) from the United Kingdom were recruited using Prolific Academic. Participants from studies 1 and 2 were excluded in order to ensure dataset independence. The data were collected in July 2022. The study was approved by the University of Edinburgh PPLS Research Ethics Committee.</p><h4>Measures and procedure.</h4><p>In Study 3, we followed the same procedure and used the same materials (20-item MORQ with five items per each relational mode) as in Study 2. Total testing took approximately 15 minutes per participant on average. All data were de-identified and collected using anonymous codes to protect participants’ privacy. No personal identifying information was collected, and the authors did not have access to any information that could identify individual participants during or after data collection.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>We fitted the exact model developed in Study 2 to the new dataset collected for Study 3 and examined its fit. The model replicated well showing excellent fit (χ<sup>2</sup> (149) = 990.79, p &lt; 0.001; CFI = 0.955; TLI = 0.943; RMSEA = 0.043). In addition to a good fit, the factor loadings were also comparable to those found in Study 2. Moreover, the correlation between the CS and EM factors was also very similar (.85 vs .80 in Study 2). The replicated model is shown in <a href=\"#pone-0287391-g003\">Fig 3</a>).</p><p>Full details of the model are tabulated on the OSF site for this paper.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287391.g003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287391.g003</a></p><h3>Discussion of Study 3</h3><p>Study 3 successfully replicated the four-factor 20-item model of the MORQ developed in Study 2 in an independent dataset. Despite no structural changes to the model, the model fit metrics were excellent and comparable to those in Study 2. We can have confidence, therefore, that this is a reliable, well-fitting, and useful model of MORQ. Study 3 also confirmed the presence of a general factor in the MORQ, as shown in Study 2. This general factor had high loadings on CS, EM and MP relational model items and low (or negative) on AR relational model items. Given that the general factor was required in two independent datasets, we believe it is not a sampling error artefact and therefore requires further explanation. For instance, this factor may assess general commitment and devotion to form social relationships with others, with low scores representing a “null relationship” [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>], an avoidant attitude towards forming relationships. However, traits such as socially desirable responding, differential emphasis on traditional social conventions and authorities across the four types, or artefacts of factors such as the closeness of the relationship to the respondent all could also account for some or all of the variance in the general factor. To explore these possibilities, we re-contacted the participants from studies 2 and 3 and tested associations with the general factor.</p><h2>Study 4</h2><p>In Study 4, we investigate the nature of the general factor that emerged in both Study 2 and Study 3. We tested three possible explanations. First, several MORQ items describe socially desirable behaviours (e.g. “<em>If either of you needs something</em>, <em>the other gives it without expecting anything in return</em>”). For this reason, we hypothesised that the general factor might represent social desirability bias, exaggerating desirable traits due to honest self-deception or conscious impression management [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>]. To test this hypothesis, we administered the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (BIDR) [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>] because it allows testing both types of bias: deliberate impression management and self-deceptive enhancement.</p><p>Second, given that in both studies 2 and 3, the general factor correlated negatively with AR items but positively with all items defining the other three MORQ models, we speculated that a simple authoritarian/non-authoritarian distinction could drive the general factor. To test this speculation, we asked participants to fill in the Right Wing Authoritarianism questionnaire (RWA) [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>], which measures authoritarian personality traits such as submission to traditional authorities and social conventions.</p><p>Finally, we hypothesised that the general factor might reflect the specific relationship with the individual a respondent was rating. To test this, we asked participants to recall the relationships they reported during Study 2 and Study 3 data collection and to classify each of these individuals by type (e.g. “colleague” or “close family”). We coded this measure as a categorical variable with eight unordered levels. We expected higher general factor loadings for close relationship types (such as close family or close friend) and lower loadings for relationships that are typically less close (e.g. an employer or service personnel).</p><h3>Method</h3><h4>Participants.</h4><p>Study 2 and Study 3 participants were re-contacted on the Prolific academic platform 3–8 months after data collection from Study 2 and Study 3 was completed. A total of 447 participants agreed to participate in the follow-up study. The data were collected in September-October 2022. The study was approved by the University of Edinburgh PPLS Research Ethics Committee.</p><h4>Measures and procedure.</h4><p>Before starting the study, participants received an explanation of the study and were asked to provide written consent by signing a consent form. After providing informed consent, the following three questionnaires were administered.</p><h4>Right Wing Autoritarianism questionnaire (RWA) [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>].</h4><p>The RWA is a 22-item instrument measuring the tendency to defer to authorities, endorsement of traditional values, and support for aggression toward outgroups. Participants respond to a series of statements (e.g., “<em>What our country really needs is a strong</em>, <em>determined leader who will crush evil</em>, <em>and take us back to our true path</em>”) on a nine-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 9 (Strongly agree).</p><h4>Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (BIDR) [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>].</h4><p>The BIDR is a 40-item instrument measuring the tendency to overstate one’s socially desirable behaviour and personality traits. The BIDR contains two separate 20-item measures, Impression Management, designed to test conscious self-presentation (e.g. “<em>I have never dropped litter on the street</em>”), and Self-Deceptive Enhancement (e.g. “<em>My first impressions of people usually turn out to be right</em>”). BIDR is scored on a seven-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Not true) to 9 (Very true).</p><h4>Relationship type.</h4><p>We asked participants to recall the relationships they reported during the original data collection in studies 2 and 3 and to classify them by type. We coded the reported type of the relationship as a categorical variable with eight levels (“Your manager or employer”, “Your employee”, “Service personnel”, “Acquaintance”, “Colleague”, “Distant family”, “Close friend”, “Close family”.</p><p>The measures were hosted online on the Qualtrics survey platform. Total testing took approximately 8 minutes per participant on average.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>First, we tested the hypothesis that authoritarianism explains the general factor scores extracted from the model using the umx function umxFactorScores(). Regression scoring was used to determine the factor scores, and potential confounding effects of authoritarianism were tested in each of the five relationships examined. The results showed no evidence of any association between the general factor and Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA). The correlation between the general factor and RWA was not significant in any of the five relationships, with correlations ranging from -.06 to .06 (e.g., in the relationship 1, r (437) = -.03, p = .504). Next, we tested whether the general factor was explained by social desirability, specifically self-deceptive enhancement and impression management scales of the BIDR. The results showed that the general factor was unrelated to both self-deceptive enhancement (e.g., in the relationship 1, r(527) = .03, p = .478) and impression management (r(527) = .04, p = .401) scales across all five relationships, contrary to our hypothesis.</p><p>Finally, we used regression to test the hypothesis that relationship type (dummy-coded with eight factors as indicated above) explains the general factor. We found that this was significant, explaining 6.2% of the variance (F(7, 2139) = 21.26, p &lt; .001).

While RWA (assessing authority) and BIDR measures (measuring socially desirable responding) were unrelated to general factor scores, relationship type did account for a portion of the variance in the general factor. High general factor loadings were associated with closer relationships (e.g. ‘close friend’). In contrast, low scores were associated with relationship types that are usually less close (e.g. ‘manager/employer’ or ‘service personnel’), suggesting that the general factor may represent the relationship’s closeness. The employee relationship had a much higher score on the general factor than the employer relationship, despite both representing the AR relationship. We believe this may reflect the paternalistic side of authoritarian leadership in which an employer’s role involves, to a degree at least, responsibility towards their employees. We discuss these findings in more depth in the general discussion.</p><h2>General discussion</h2><p>This paper aimed to test whether the MORQ measures four relationship models, as predicted by the RMT, and whether it accurately identifies the proposed structure of social relationship taxonomy. In the three studies reported above, we confirmed the existence of the original four factors, along with support for a general relationship factor. This new model of the MORQ has several implications for RMT and suggests additional directions for research. Each of these is discussed below.</p><p>Our main results (studies 2 and 3) supported the Haslam and Fiske [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>] four-factor model of social relationships. The model demonstrated a good fit after eliminating items with significant cross-loadings and items that loaded on factors other than their intended ones. This refinement resulted in a model consisting of five items for each social relationship mode. The model also required some minor structural changes. Instead of four intercorrelated factors, the model required a general factor at the item level–in some ways, a more interpretable structure than the six factor intercorrelations it replaced. The general factor loaded positively on CS, EM and MP items but negatively on AR items.</p><p>We also found that EM and CS factors are highly correlated (r = .85 in Study 2 sample and r = .80 in Study 3 sample). This is consistent with the original Haslam and Fiske [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>] findings, where these factors were positively correlated (r = .60). Despite the high correlation, combining these factors into one relationship worsened the model’s fit in our data, suggesting that these two relational models are distinct, but usually work together to define actual relationships. Our model was successfully replicated in an independent dataset, providing further support for the Relational Models four-factor structure of social relationships.</p><p>In Study 4, we tested the possible meaning of this general factor by undertaking three additional tests. First, we speculated that the general factor might reflect social desirability, overreporting desirable traits due to cognitive bias or conscious impression management. We tested this explanation by including two measures of social desirability [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>], impression management, measuring conscious attempt to enhance self-presentation to others and self-deceptive enhancement, measuring an honest overestimation of one’s positive traits. Both these measures were not related to the general factor. This indicates that social desirability bias is not a major concern for the MORQ questionnaire.</p><p>As a second possible explanation, we tested whether the general factor measures a broad tendency to construe relationships based on a hierarchy. We theorised that CS, EM, and MP relational models describe relationships of individuals with the same status, whereas AR model explicitly implies unequal status. This would predict a significant negative relationship between the general factor and authoritarianism, but this was not the case; in our data, the correlation between the general factor and right-wing authoritarianism was not significant. Thus, we feel comfortable concluding that the general relational factor does not reflect hierarchical tendencies.</p><p>Finally, we tested whether the general factor represents the closeness of the relationship. We hypothesised that close relationships (those between close friends and family) should manifest as higher in CS and EM relational models than AR and MP, as is reflected in the general factor loadings. Our measure of reported relationship type correlated significantly and positively with the general factor. However, the strength of this relationship was weak, suggesting that relationship closeness is only a partial explanation of the general relational factor. As higher scores on this factor typically occurred for closer relationships, a useful direction for future work would be to study a tendency to invest in building connections. This would be consistent with the concept Fiske [<a href=\"#pone.0287391.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>] termed general commitment and devotion to form social relationships with others, with low scores representing a “null relationship”, an avoidant attitude towards forming relationships.</p><p>Although our manuscript primarily aimed to enhance the MORQ’s psychometric properties and confirm its four-factor structure, our findings also provide insights into the underlying structure of social relationships. Our results suggest that relationships are structured around, at a minimum, these four models of interpersonal relations. Moreover, our findings refute the notion that these four models are merely consequences of a simpler, two-dimensional model (such as equality-inequality or close-distant) since these models did not adequately fit our data.</p><h3>Limitations and future directions</h3><p>We should keep in mind the limitations of the study. The present study supported a self-report measure of relational models with five instead of eight to nine items measuring each relational model. As the original 33 items were designed to cover a spectrum of behavioural domains, generating new items to replace the missing items may be of value to capture the complete spectrum of relationship models. That said, the scales developed here and scored by averaging responses for each scale should be valid for their intended purposes or for identifying relationship models. Of course, a further limitation is that we cannot rule out that other relational models may exist–seeking evidence for relationships that do not fit the four-model structure would be informative regarding the validity and generality of the broader theory. The present studies also were conducted thirty years after the initial study and in a different yet related culture (the UK compared to the US). This may partially account for the finding that some original items did not load on the expected factors. The finding that despite the three decades having elapsed and testing in a much changed and different culture in the UK, the model was validated is a testimony to the durability of the RMT model. However, international, cross-cultural replication of the model in non-western samples and further examination of the nature of the general relational factor are required. The future directions for this more compact, valid, and highly interpretable instrument appear wide. The four social models identified in this study represent universal building blocks of relationships and can be applied across a range of psychological sub-disciplines to gain insights into specific domains of social interactions. For example, within the context of parent-child relationships, one may explore how the four models manifest in parent-child interactions and their impact on child development. Similarly, within the field of education, the four models may be used to examine the dynamics of teacher-student relationships and their impact on student achievement and well-being. By mapping these universal models onto discipline-specific structures, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the role of social interactions in various contexts and develop tailored interventions to promote positive relationship outcomes. For instance, workplace and organisational psychology is a particularly suitable discipline for the application of reliable, valid measures that can diagnose the current disposition of relationships among staff across different levels of business units or larger structures. These measures can test the alignment of these models with the intended and desired business strategy and assess the efficacy of interventions designed to incentivise relationship change where necessary. Surveying organisations using these measures can reveal if relations designed to primarily embody hierarchy and proportionality are functioning as intended. Additionally, these measures can test the association of incentives with the strength of reported models in a given relationship or modulate incentives to assess the effects predicted by the Relational Incentives Theory. Thus, these measures can add significant value to organisational research and practice.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Our study aimed to establish the validity and psychometric structure of the MORQ, resulting in a compact, reliable, and valid instrument suitable for use in various applied settings. By providing an efficient means of measuring individuals’ preferences for different relational models, the validated scale can be used to further explore and apply RMT. Our findings suggest that the MORQ can be a useful tool in both research and applied settings, facilitating a deeper understanding of the role of relational models in human behaviour and well-being.</p><h2>Supporting information</h2><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287391.s001\">S1 Appendix. </a>Items retained in final relational models scale, validated in Studies 2 and 3.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287391.s001\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287391.s001</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(DOCX)</p><h2>References</h2><h3>Subject Areas <div id=\"subjInfo\">?</div>\\n    <div id=\"subjInfoText\">\\n      <p>For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/PLOS/plos-thesaurus/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link opens in new window\">here</a>.</p>\\n      <span class=\"inline-intro\">We want your feedback.</span> Do these Subject Areas make sense for this article?

In conventional methods for assessing transmissibility trends or changes, univariate time-varying reproduction numbers are calculated without taking into account transmission across multiple communities. In this paper, we propose a multivariate-count time series model for epidemics. We also propose a statistical method for estimating the transmission of infections across multiple communities and the time-varying reproduction numbers of each community simultaneously from a multivariate time series of case counts. We apply our method to incidence data for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to reveal the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the epidemic process.</p><p><strong>Citation: </strong>Koyama S (2023) Multivariate epidemic count time series model.

Epidemic modeling has been used to describe a wide variety of phenomena. For instance, the spread of information, opinions, and social behaviors can be modeled as a contagion process [<a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>]. Epidemic modeling lies at the core of a research field that crosses different disciplines. In this study, we developed a multivariate time-series epidemic analysis model.</p><p>During an ongoing pandemic, the most commonly available type of data is the daily (or weekly) number of newly reported cases. The time series of case counts provides information on the epidemic size and transmissibility trends. The time-varying effective reproduction number was defined as the expected number of secondary cases arising from a single primary case. They are widely used to monitor these trends. Recent developments in epidemiological data analysis have utilized statistical methodologies to improve the efficiency of estimating the effective reproduction number [<a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>]. However, most existing methods are limited to univariate time-series analyses. Although epidemics spread across multiple communities, populations, or regions, these methods can only be used to calculate the univariate effective reproduction numbers of each community separately. To incorporate infection transmission over multiple communities, it is necessary to extend these methods to perform multivariate analysis.</p><p>In this study, we propose a multivariate count time series model that describes an epidemic process in multiple nodes. Central to our approach is introducing latent variables to represent successive infections in transmission chains. These latent variables enable us to make posterior inferences regarding the transmission of infections across multiple nodes and develop an EM-type algorithm for estimating the model parameters. In particular, the proposed algorithm can be used to simultaneously estimate the entries in the adjacency matrix and time-varying effective reproduction numbers of each node from a multivariate incidence time series. An application of our method is demonstrated using synthetic and actual data from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><h3>Related works</h3><p>The effective reproduction number can be defined in two approaches: instantaneous and cohort reproduction numbers. The former measures transmission at a specific point in time, while the latter measures transmission in a specific cohort of individuals [<a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. In the following methods, either of these reproduction numbers are estimated from a time series of case counts.</p><p>Wallinga and Teunis’s method is based on the likelihood of a renewal model and is commonly used to estimate the cohort reproduction number [<a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. In the methods proposed by [<a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>] (EpiEstim) and Bettencourt and Ribeiro [<a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>], the instantaneous reproduction number is estimated using a Bayesian framework. The main difference between these two methods lies in the model assumption. A renewal model is assumed in EpiEstim, similar to the Wallinga and Teunis method, whereas the Bettencourt and Ribeiro method is based on the linearized growth rate of a SIR model. Compared to the SIR model, the renewal model involves simpler parametric assumptions regarding the epidemic process and requires only the generation interval distribution. An advantage of methods based on the renewal model is their simplicity: Parsimony reduces the risk of model misspecification when there are many unknowns in the underlying process. A comprehensive comparison of these three methods was presented by [<a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>].</p><p>In a recently proposed method [<a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>], the cohort reproduction number was estimated and combined with the state-space model in a renewal model, and the estimation problem was solved using a recursive Bayesian smoothing procedure. Parag [<a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>] independently proposed a method to estimate the instantaneous reproduction number along the same lines. To the best of our knowledge, these are state-of-the-art methods for estimating the effective reproduction number from an incidence curve.</p><p>However, note that all these methods apply only to univariate time-series data.</p><h2>Methods</h2><h3>Multivariate-count time series model</h3><p>First, we consider a univariate epidemic model. Let <em>n</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> be the number of cases in which symptoms begin at time <em>t</em>. Given an initial case at time <em>t</em> = 1, the rate of new cases at time <em>t</em>(≥ 2) can be described as\\n<a name=\"pone.0287389.e001\" id=\"pone.0287389.e001\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287389.e001\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(1)</span></span>\\nwhere {<em>ϕ</em><sub><em>τ</em></sub>} is the serial interval distribution (i.e., the distribution of time from symptom onset in the primary case to symptom onset in the secondary case [<a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>]) and <em>R</em><sub><em>t</em>−<em>τ</em></sub> is the effective reproduction number at time <em>t</em> − <em>τ</em>.</p><p>Before extending it to perform multivariate analysis, we contrast <a href=\"#pone.0287389.e001\">Eq (1)</a> with the conventional renewal model that describes epidemic processes [<a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>].\\n<a name=\"pone.0287389.e002\" id=\"pone.0287389.e002\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287389.e002\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(2)</span></span>\\nThe most significant difference between these two models lies in their treatment of the effective reproduction number. Here, <em>R</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> in <a href=\"#pone.0287389.e002\">Eq (2)</a> represents the instantaneous reproduction number, while <em>R</em><sub><em>t</em>−<em>τ</em></sub> in <a href=\"#pone.0287389.e001\">Eq (1)</a> represents the cohort reproduction number, as shown in <a href=\"#pone.0287389.s001\">S1 File</a>. Additionally, the count <em>n</em><sub><em>t</em>−<em>τ</em></sub> in <a href=\"#pone.0287389.e002\">Eq (2)</a> represents the number of cases infected at time <em>t</em> − <em>τ</em>; consequently, {<em>ϕ</em><sub><em>τ</em></sub>} represents the generation time distribution. Therefore, to apply this model to reported cases, it is necessary to adjust the time lag between infection and symptom onset [<a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>]. By contrast, because the case definition in <a href=\"#pone.0287389.e001\">Eq (1)</a> is based on symptoms, there is no need to adjust for the time lag. Hence, we employ <a href=\"#pone.0287389.e001\">Eq (1)</a> as the basis of our multivariate model.</p><p>We consider an infection process that spreads over <em>D</em> nodes, where each node represents a group of individuals.

To mimic the COVID-19 pandemic, we employed a log-normal distribution for the serial interval distribution {<em>ϕ</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>} with a mean and standard deviation of 4.7 and 2.9 days, respectively, [<a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. The transmission ratios were set as <em>a</em><sub>11</sub> = <em>a</em><sub>22</sub> = 0.9 and <em>a</em><sub>12</sub> = <em>a</em><sub>21</sub> = 0.1. The time-varying reproduction numbers of each node are shown in <a href=\"#pone-0287389-g001\">Fig 1a</a>. Using these parameters and a given initial infection at <em>t</em> = 1, the model given by Eqs (<a href=\"#pone.0287389.e003\">3</a>) and (<a href=\"#pone.0287389.e006\">5</a>) is used to generate <em>N</em><sub>1:<em>T</em></sub>. In <a href=\"#pone-0287389-g001\">Fig 1b</a>, we plot the simulated case counts <em>N</em><sub>1:<em>T</em></sub> for each node (black lines). Because of the profile of the effective reproduction numbers, the incidence curves for both nodes exhibit two waves: the first and second are caused by nodes 1 and 2, respectively.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>(a) Time-varying reproduction numbers used in the simulation.

As expected, we observed that the second wave in node 1 was dominated by infections transmitted from node 2, whereas the first wave in node 2 was initiated by the outbreak of node 1.</p><p>To examine the effect of overlooking inter-node infections on estimates of time-varying reproduction numbers, we estimated <em>R</em> with the identity matrix for <em>A</em> fixed, that is, separate estimates for each node (<a href=\"#pone-0287389-g001\">Fig 1d</a>; ‘OnlyR’). The estimated reproductive numbers are substantially biased. The reproduction number of node 1 during the first wave was underestimated because ignoring the infections node 1 transmitted to node 2, whereas the reproduction number during the second wave was overestimated because it counted the infections transmitted from node 2. (The same holds for the estimated reproduction number of node 2.)</p><p>For comparison, we applied two other estimation methods to estimate the time-varying reproduction numbers. The first method is that proposed by Wallinga and Teunis (‘WT’), which is widely used to estimate effective reproduction numbers [<a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. In the second method [<a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>], the effective reproduction number is estimated using the state-space method equipped with a Cauchy transition density (“Cauchy”). As these methods are applicable only to univariate time series, the time-varying reproduction numbers for each node are estimated separately. The estimation results obtained using these two methods are plotted in <a href=\"#pone-0287389-g001\">Fig 1e and 1f</a>. As was the case with OnlyR, upward and downward biases were observed in these two methods because the inter-node infections were ignored. The difference in the estimated reproduction numbers among these three methods was attributed to the smoothness assumption made in these estimation methods. In particular, the WT is easily influenced by data fluctuations in the initial phase of the epidemic, and the estimated reproduction numbers decrease at the end of the recorded interval owing to right truncation.</p><p>We performed an additional numerical study, in which the number of nodes (dimensions) was varied from <em>D</em> = 10 to 50. The transmission ratios were randomly chosen and normalized such that <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287389.e044\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span>, and the time-varying reproduction numbers of each node were randomly chosen between the two profiles, as shown in <a href=\"#pone-0287389-g001\">Fig 1a</a>. To quantify the estimation performance, we compute the average relative error as follows:\\n<a name=\"pone.0287389.e045\" id=\"pone.0287389.e045\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287389.e045\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(17)</span></span>\\nfor time-varying reproduction numbers. We performed the numerical study 10 times with different samples and reported the average performance metrics over the 10 runs. The results are summarized in <a href=\"#pone-0287389-t001\">Table 1</a>. Our method outperformed the other three methods over the range of dimensions examined. This confirmed that the estimation of time-varying reproductive numbers can be significantly improved by considering the transmission of infections across multiple nodes.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287389.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287389.t001</a></p><h3>Analysis of actual data</h3><p>We applied our method to actual data from the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan (<a href=\"https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/open-data.html\">https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/open-data.html</a>).

The prefectures are arranged in geographical order from northeast to southwest. Inter-prefectural infections exhibit a community structure that is correlated with the demographic, economic, and industrial characteristics of the prefectures. The largest community was centered around Tokyo (the capital of Japan), the second-largest community around Osaka (the largest prefecture in the west), and the third-largest community was centered around Aichi (the largest industrial area).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>(a) Matrix visualization of estimated secondary infections <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287389.e056\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span> plotted in log scale.

The central concept of our approach is to introduce latent variables that represent secondary infections in transmission chains. This enabled us to infer infection transmission across multiple nodes and develop an EM-type algorithm for estimating model parameters. The proposed algorithm simultaneously estimates the weighted adjacency matrix and time-varying reproduction numbers for each node from a multivariate time series of incidence. In addition, we formulated a state-smoothing algorithm to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers. This enabled us to use a tool developed for state-space models.</p><p>Because the serial interval distribution is fixed, our estimation method is limited to incidence data whereby the statistical properties of the serial interval remain unchanged. While we employed the log-normal distribution estimated in the early phase of COVID-19 [<a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>], the omicron variant, which became prevalent in January 2022, spreads more easily than the earlier variants of SARS-CoV-2 [<a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. Therefore, it is necessary to revise the estimate of the serial interval distribution to assess the transmissibility during distinct phases of the pandemic.</p><p>Although we assume that the entire outbreak is driven by transmission within the network, the proposed model (<a href=\"#pone.0287389.e003\">3</a>) can include case imports from outside the network as\\n<a name=\"pone.0287389.e058\" id=\"pone.0287389.e058\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287389.e058\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(18)</span></span>\\nwhere <em>μ</em><sub><em>it</em></sub> is the import rate in case (<em>i</em>, <em>t</em>). Accordingly, the cases imported from outside the network, denoted by <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287389.e059\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span>, are incorporated into <a href=\"#pone.0287389.e008\">Eq (6)</a> as\\n<a name=\"pone.0287389.e060\" id=\"pone.0287389.e060\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287389.e060\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(19)</span></span>\\nfor which posterior inference based on the multinomial distribution (<a href=\"#pone.0287389.e014\">7</a>) is applied to differentiate between cases arising from the network and those imported from outside. The rate of case importations, <em>μ</em><sub><em>it</em></sub>, may be pre-estimated by medical inspection during airport quarantine; if this is not the case, simultaneous estimation of <em>μ</em><sub><em>it</em></sub>, along with the adjacency matrix and time-varying reproduction numbers, will be developed, which is left for future work.</p><p>The concept of introducing latent variables to represent transmission chains is similar to that of the branching representation of the Hawkes process [<a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287389.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. A Hawkes-type point process was obtained in the continuous-time limit of the count time-series model. From this perspective, our model can be regarded as its discrete-time counterpart and provides a basis for its application in the analysis of multivariate count time series.</p><h2>Supporting information</h2><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287389.s001\">S1 File. </a>Supplementary material to the manuscript.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287389.s001\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287389.s001</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(PDF)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287389.s002\">S1 Fig. </a>Estimated effective reproduction numbers for 47 prefectures.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287389.s002\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287389.s002</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(PDF)</p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>The author would like to thank the participants of “Workshop on Mathematical Modeling,” held in Karuizawa in July 2022, for their valuable comments.</p><h2>References</h2><h3>Subject Areas <div id=\"subjInfo\">?</div>\\n    <div id=\"subjInfoText\">\\n      <p>For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/PLOS/plos-thesaurus/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link opens in new window\">here</a>.</p>\\n      <span class=\"inline-intro\">We want your feedback.</span> Do these Subject Areas make sense for this article?

It is unknown how well the predicted lung volume corresponds with computed tomography (CT) derived total lung volume (TLV). The aim of this study was to compare the GLI-2021 model predictions of total lung capacity (TLC) with CT-derived TLV. 151 female and 139 male healthy participants (age 45–65 years) were consecutively selected from a Dutch general population cohort, the Imaging in Lifelines (ImaLife) cohort. In ImaLife, all participants underwent low-dose, inspiratory chest CT. TLV was measured by an automated analysis, and compared to predicted TLC based on the GLI-2021 model. Bland-Altman analysis was performed for analysis of systematic bias and range between limits of agreement. To further mimic the GLI-cohort all analyses were repeated in a subset of never-smokers (51% of the cohort). Mean±SD of TLV was 4.7±0.9 L in women and 6.2±1.2 L in men. TLC overestimated TLV, with systematic bias of 1.0 L in women and 1.6 L in men. Range between limits of agreement was 3.2 L for women and 4.2 L for men, indicating high variability. Performing the analysis with never-smokers yielded similar results. In conclusion, in a healthy cohort, predicted TLC substantially overestimates CT-derived TLV, with low precision and accuracy. In a clinical context where an accurate or precise lung volume is required, measurement of lung volume should be considered.</p><p><strong>Citation: </strong>Wisselink HJ, Steerenberg DJD, Rook M, Pelgrim G-J, Heuvelmans MA, van den Berge M, et al.

For diagnosis and disease monitoring of COPD, several lung volumetric parameters are determined, including the total lung capacity (TLC) [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. While the diagnosis of COPD is still based on the results of spirometry, the (separately measured) TLC is often of great importance as additional measure.</p><p>There are three methods to measure the TLC. If performed at end-tidal volume, the gas dilution method (often performed with helium) and body plethysmography (often called body box), provide the functional residual capacity [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>] that can be added to the inspiratory capacity to obtain the TLC [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>]. The third method is the use of an inspiratory computed tomography (CT) scan, on which the lungs can be segmented, generally without the conducting airways [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. This method relies on the assumption that the CT scan is acquired at full inspiration. Gas dilution and body box will mostly have matched results for subjects without air trapping [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. While a CT scan allows diagnostic evaluation of both airways and parenchyma, the CT-derived total lung volume (TLV) tends to differ slightly from the first two methods, although there is a strong correlation between TLV and gas dilution or body box (r 0.87–0.90) [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. Which of these three should be considered the reference standard depends on the specific clinical question or research goal [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>].</p><p>To give a correct interpretation of lung volume measurements with regards to potential disease presence, severity and progress in time, expected values are required for reference [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. Accurate prediction of TLC is of importance in some clinical applications, such as in lung transplantation where a potential lung donor is matched to a recipient [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. Recently, the Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI) published a guideline with updated models to predict the median values for several static lung volumes for healthy individuals, among which the TLC [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. This model was endorsed by the European respiratory society (ERS) [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. The 2021 TLC model is a generalized additive model of location shape and scale (GAMLSS), which is mathematically similar to a logistic model with age and height as parameters. It also includes a spline term that depends on sex and age. To the best of our knowledge, the GLI-2021 model has not been directly compared to CT-derived lung volume. It is unknown how well the new GLI model corresponds with CT-derived lung volumes.</p><p>The GLI models are often applied to clinical non-healthy populations, for instance to provide a baseline estimation at time of diagnosis and for follow-up purposes, expressing measurements as percentage of expected or predicted [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. This may lead to a mismatch in clinical practice if the goal is to estimate the expected lung volume in a normal healthy person instead of the idealized reference population used by the GLI [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]. The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of the GLI-2021 model with CT-derived lung volumes in a healthy consecutively selected sample from a Western European general population-based study cohort.</p><h2>Materials and methods</h2><h3>Participant selection</h3><p>CT scans in this study were acquired as part of the ongoing ImaLife study. ImaLife is embedded in Lifelines, a population-based cohort study in the northern part of the Netherlands [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. Lifelines is a multi-disciplinary prospective population-based cohort study examining—in a unique three-generation design—the health and health-related behaviors of 167,729 persons living in the North of the Netherlands. It employs a broad range of investigative procedures in assessing the biomedical, socio-demographic, behavioral, physical and psychological factors which contribute to the health and disease of the general population, with a special focus on multi-morbidity and complex genetics [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. In ImaLife, participants from Lifelines aged 45 or older are invited to undergo a low-dose chest CT scan. The institutional ethical review board from the University Medical Center Groningen gave ethical approval for the ImaLife study, and all participants provided written informed consent. The ImaLife study was registered with the Dutch Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects (<a href=\"https://www.toetsingonline.nl/\">https://www.toetsingonline.nl</a>, NL58592.042.16). For our present study, the aim was to select a sample of 400 participants from the 1421 individuals who were scanned between June and December 2018, by consecutively including 50 women and 50 men per 5-year age group, with an age range of 45–65 years. This was done to achieve an even distribution across age. Participants with incomplete imaging data (n = 3) or missing weight information (n = 5) were replaced by continuing the sampling. Prior to the main analyses of this study, we excluded participants with COPD or self-reported lung disease (n = 110). The main analysis was performed on the 290 healthy participants (cohort H). Additional analyses were performed for the full general population sample (cohort GP, n = 400) and including only healthy never-smokers (cohort HNS, n = 147). A flowchart detailing the selection steps is shown in <a href=\"#pone-0287383-g001\">Fig 1</a>.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>Flow chart describing the selection of the GP (general population), H (healthy participants), and HNS (healthy never smokers) cohorts from the ImaLife study.</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287383.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287383.g001</a></p><h3>Lifelines parameters</h3><p>This study uses data from the second assessment round of Lifelines (2014–2018), which includes questionnaire answers, as well as results from a pulmonary function test [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]. The questionnaire data included smoking status, pack-years, and self-reported lung disease. The spirometric data included the Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV₁) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), which allows determination of the GOLD stage, but this does not allow derivation of the TLC [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. Participant height and weight were self-reported during the assessment and shortly before the CT scan, respectively. The body mass index (BMI) was computed from body weight and height. For the purposes of the analyses in this study, a participant was considered to be healthy if she/he reported no COPD, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, or asthma. In case of missing data, participants were considered ever-smokers or non-healthy, respectively.</p><h3>TLC prediction model</h3><p>For this study, the ERS-endorsed GLI guideline model was used [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. The GLI model and its predecessors were developed with the use of participants without a history of smoking or lung disease only [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>]. The 2021 model equations look like a stratified logistic regression, although the method used to derive these equations is a generalized additive models of location shape and scale (GAMLSS) [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. The model is based on age and height: exp(-10.1128 +0.1062*ln(age) +2.2259*ln(height) +Mspline) for women and exp(-10.5861 +0.1433*ln(age) +2.3155*ln(height) +Mspline) for men [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. Because one of the parameters in this model (Mspline) is a variable based on sex and age, a lookup table is required to use this model, which is provided as a supplementary material to the original publication (permanently archived at <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20210629151841/https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/erj/57/3/2000289/DC1/embed/inline-supplementary-material-2.xlsx?download=true\">http://web.archive.org/web/20210629151841/https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/erj/57/3/2000289/DC1/embed/inline-supplementary-material-2.xlsx?download=true</a>).</p><h3>CT scan data collection</h3><p>Low-dose CT scans were acquired on a third-generation dual source CT system (Somatom Force, Siemens Healthineers) with a tube potential of 120 kV and a reference current-time product of 20 mAs (median dose-length product for cohort H 58 mGy, range 29–113) [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]. The field of view was 350 mm (with a pitch of 3.0), or, in case of a large body habitus, 400 mm (pitch 2.5). Scans were reconstructed with a slice thickness/increment of 1.0/0.7 mm, yielding approximately isotropic voxels. For this study, the reconstruction with a medium-smooth (Br40) kernel was used. The scans were acquired at inspiration according to clinical standard breath coaching.</p><h3>Image analysis</h3><p>Image analysis consisted of a fully automatic extraction of the lung volume from the CT scan. This was performed with the Syngo.Via Pulmo3D package (version VB40A-HF02, Siemens Healthineers), which did not require manual interaction. A trained researcher (DS) checked the segmentation quality. This quality check consisted of confirming all lung parenchyma was included. Lobar segmentation failures were accepted as long as the overall lung volume would be correct. An example of the segmentation result is included in the supplemental materials.</p><p>CT scans of cases with a large difference between the GLI model prediction and the CT-derived lung volume, i.e. difference being in the upper and lower 5% extremes, were visually inspected. This visual inspection was performed to ensure acquisition problems (e.g. substantial omission of an apical or caudal section of the lungs) or major pathology (e.g. severe emphysema/fibrosis) were not present and could therefore not bias the lung volume. Technical physicians (HJW and GJP, 4 years of experience in chest CT research/scan evaluation) performed visual review of these 30 cases.</p><h3>Statistical analyses</h3><p>The two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to determine whether TLV, weight, and height for women and men are from the same distribution. Differences in age, height, weight, and TLV between women and men were tested with t-tests. Then, linear regression was used to predict TLV stratified by sex, where age, height, and weight were included as parameters. Model performance of the two models was quantified by correlating the predicted model values with the observed values of TLV by using Pearson’s ρ to estimate correlation and R<sup>2</sup> to estimate model fit. Then Bland-Altman analyses were performed to evaluate the systematic differences between the estimated values and the observed TLV values. The mean difference was considered as the estimated bias, and the variability is indicated by the difference between the 95% limits of agreement (ΔLoA). Levene’s test was used to test whether the ΔLoA was the same between models and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to test difference between systematic biases. All analyses were stratified by sex. The results of the Bland-Altman analysis were shown in a residual plot, showing the measured volume on one axis and the difference between TLV and TLC on the other axis.</p><p>The Bland-Altman analyses were repeated with the original consecutively selected general population sample (cohort GP, n = 400) and with only the healthy never-smokers (cohort HNS), see <a href=\"#pone-0287383-g001\">Fig 1</a>. The cohort HNS was used to further mimic the cohort used for the GLI model [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>].</p><p>Statistical analysis of derived data was performed with SPSS 26 (IBM). Data visualization and simple computations were done with MATLAB R2022b (Mathworks).</p><h2>Results</h2><p>Visual review of cases with a large difference between predicted TLC and measured TLV did not reveal any anomalies substantial enough to warrant exclusion of the participant. Mean participant age was 54 and 53 years for women and men, respectively (<a href=\"#pone-0287383-t001\">Table 1</a>). Mean weight was 74 kg for women and 86 kg for men, and mean height was 1.70 m for women and 1.84 m for men (mean BMI 25.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for both women and men). The prevalence of (ever) smoking was 58% for women and 55% for men (including missing data in 4 and 5 cases, respectively).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287383.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287383.t001</a></p><p>The plots in <a href=\"#pone-0287383-g002\">Fig 2</a> show TLV, height, and weight versus age.

Analysis outcomes for the three cohort subgroups including p-values are shown in <a href=\"#pone.0287383.s003\">S2 Table</a>.</p><p>An optimized linear regression model based on the study population (i.e. the healthy participants) resulted in prediction formulae of lung volume for women and men (<a href=\"#pone.0287383.s004\">S1 Equations</a>). The mean difference between the predictions and the TLV was -0.040 L for women and 0.026 L for men, indicating that the rounded parameters fit the data. The linear regression resulted in ΔLoA values of 3.2 L and 3.9 L, compared to the GLI-model a reduction of 1.2% (women), and 6.6% (men). ΔLoA values were not equal between the linear regression and GLI model (p&gt;0.364).</p><h2>Discussion</h2><p>This study found a substantial mismatch between the predicted total lung capacity based on the recent GLI model and CT-measured lung volume. The GLI model tended to overestimate the lung volume compared to the actual, measured TLV, by 1.0–1.6 L (24–31%), with larger overestimation in individuals with a lower TLV. The ΔLoA was high (3.2–4.2L), indicating low precision of the GLI model compared to TLV. When restricting the analyses to healthy never-smokers or expanding the analyses to include non-healthy participants, the precision and accuracy did not meaningfully change. This implies a prediction may not be sufficiently accurate or precise in clinical situations where true lung volume matters.</p><p>CT is an increasingly important modality in the evaluation of quantitative lung parameters [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. There are suggestions that CT-derived parameters might be more sensitive than PFT measurements [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>]. Others have suggested that CT measurements are more reproducible than a body box [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>]. This has led to the argument in a recent review by Bakker et al. that CT-derived parameters can, now or in the future replace some or all of the spirometry-based parameters [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. The current study adds further evidence for this argument. When considering the difference between the GLI model predictions and actual CT-derived lung volume found in this study, there are several possible explanations.</p><p>Firstly, CT is normally acquired in supine position, while spirometry is performed in a sitting position; this in itself leads to a positional difference in lung volume. This is supported by the finding by Yamada et al., who compared supine and standing CT in healthy volunteers, and also reported sitting pulmonary function test measurements [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. They reported that the mean lung volume measured in a supine position was 9.9% smaller than the mean lung volume measured in a standing position. The (unexplained) difference between standing TLV and sitting TLC was 7.5%. Since the difference between (supine) TLV and (sitting) TLC in the present study was 24–31%, this suggests only a proportion of the systematic bias may be due to the difference in position, but a third to half of the difference is likely due to overestimation by the GLI model. Furthermore, the high variability cannot be explained by positional difference.</p><p>Secondly, there are technical differences between CT and spirometry. To compare CT-derived volumes with other types of measurements, it is important to be aware of the intrinsic differences between the body box measurement (or gas dilution) and the measurement on a CT scan. Normally, the CT volume measurement will exclude conducting airways, while the volume of these airways is included for body plethysmography [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. However, since this difference would be approximately 20 mL (trachea only) up to 60 mL (full bronchial tree), it is not clinically relevant [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>]. The lung segmentation might include air pockets that are not actually ventilated (or exclude air pockets that are) due to imaging artifacts. This kind of segmentation issues should be rare in the absence of pathology and was not observed in this study.</p><p>Thirdly, pathology may influence the measurements. On one hand, it may be difficult to reach maximal inspiration for patients with restrictive lung disease; on the other hand, there may be hyperinflation in patients with COPD. Garfield et al. compared body plethysmography to CT for a cohort of COPD GOLD 3 and 4 patients [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. They found the TLV to be 17.3% lower than the measured TLC. As we excluded patients with COPD (based on spirometry) in our study, this did not play a role in the current results.</p><p>Despite the differences outlined above, the correlation between measured TLC and TLV is high (r 0.87–0.90), regardless of the TLC measurement method (body box or gas diffusion) [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>].</p><p>As outlined by Hall et al., the differences in predicted TLC between different models are minor in the age range 45–65. Of the six TLC prediction models spanning this age, four are within 250 mL of each other [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. In the past decade, most prediction models (including the GLI-2012 and GLI-2021) have complex formulae, e.g. using logistic regressions with model parameters derived from splines in a separate lookup table [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>]. Despite this more mathematical approach, the GLI model did not result in a better fit for our study population than our linear regression. The reason is either the difference in population, or a difference in parameter choice. The cohort in this study includes participants with a smoking history and pulmonary pathology, as it is a population cohort. The linear regression includes weight as a parameter, while most other prediction models do not. Both of these differences could lead to a difference in model performance. However, we specifically performed analyses in healthy (i.e. no positive GOLD stages, no reported lung disease) and never-smoking subcohorts, to eliminate possible effects by pulmonary pathology and smoking history.</p><p>The main strength of this study is the cohort. As a sample from a population-based cohort, it matches the characteristics of the general population more closely than a hospital sample would. This is for instance important in early disease detection and monitoring and also particularly valuable in the context of lung transplantation donors where size does matter. The difference in age range between the current study population (45–65 years) and a hospital sample can be reasonably expected to be of lesser importance. This is because participants in early disease detection programs and candidates for lung donation tend to be younger than a typical hospital patient. For this study three different population types were used: a general population (cohort GP), healthy subjects (cohort H), and healthy never-smokers (cohort HNS). In general only never-smokers without pulmonary conditions (cohort HNS) have been used to develop prediction formulae [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>]. This ignores the reality that a substantial proportion of the population is ever-smoker. Even among never-smokers there may be undiagnosed emphysema as found on CT [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>]. The prediction formulae should be regarded as providing expected values for healthy never-smokers and may consequently not be accurately predicting normal values for more general populations.</p><p>The assumption that our population matches the GLI-2021 population is both a strength and a limitation of this study. The difference in age range between this study (45–65) and the GLI-2021 population (5–80) is not expected to have a large impact, as the GLI model is reasonably linear in the age range 45–65 years. To mitigate this, a visual review (including fibrosis, emphysema, and incomplete inclusion of lungs on CT) was performed on subjects with a large difference between predicted and measured lung volume. In this review no obvious disease was found. Furthermore, sub-analyses were performed with only never-smokers without pulmonary disease, as well as with the general population sample. These sub-analyses did not yield a meaningfully different variability or systematic bias.</p><p>One limitation of this study is the use of the clinical standard breath coaching, which does not completely ensure full inspiration. The breath coaching during spirometry tends to more effectively ensure maximal effort. A further limitation is the lack of external validation for our linear regression model. The same cohort was used for the creation of the model and to test the performance of the model. This limits the generalizability. Combining this limitation with the particular height and weight of the study population, it would be interesting to repeat this study in a country with a different distribution of height and weight. Since the spirometry did not allow derivation of the TLC, it was not possible to compare a measured TLC with a measured TLV.</p><p>The current prediction models have a poor performance for lung volume as compared to actual measurements on CT in a general population cohort. Even without external validation (allowing for over-fitting of parameters), our linear regression only yielded a marginal reduction in variability of 1–7%. Combining this with the inherent population spread, as evident from the data reported by Hall et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>], it does not seem likely that a model with easily obtainable parameters will be able to predict lung volume with reasonable precision [<a href=\"#pone.0287383.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]. Future research should evaluate the possibility of machine learning to assist in accurate and precise predictions, which should be tested in populations of different ethnicity. Moreover, future research should be aimed at exploring the potential value of CT derived lung volume and other parameters for lung disease detection and monitoring.</p><h3>Conclusions and implications</h3><p>This study found that there is a substantial mismatch between the GLI-predicted TLC and CT-derived TLV. The predicted TLC generally overestimates actual, measured lung volume, and has a high variability compared to TLV. A measurement (CT or otherwise) rather than a prediction should be performed in situations where size matters.</p><h2>Supporting information</h2><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287383.s001\">S1 Fig. </a>Syngo.Via Pulmo 3D interface screenshot.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287383.s001\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287383.s001</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(PNG)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287383.s002\">S1 Table. </a>Population characteristics stratified by sex.</h3><p class=\"preSiDOI\">Participants were excluded from the HNS (healthy never-smokers) sub-cohort if they reported a smoking history, had self-reported lung disease, were determined by the spirometry to have COPD, or if any of these were missing.</p><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287383.s002\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287383.s002</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(DOCX)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287383.s003\">S2 Table. </a>Outcome comparison.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287383.s003\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287383.s003</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(DOCX)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287383.s004\">S1 Equations. </a>Results of linear regression analysis.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287383.s004\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287383.s004</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(DOCX)</p><h2>References</h2><h3>Subject Areas <div id=\"subjInfo\">?</div>\\n    <div id=\"subjInfoText\">\\n      <p>For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/PLOS/plos-thesaurus/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link opens in new window\">here</a>.</p>\\n      <span class=\"inline-intro\">We want your feedback.</span> Do these Subject Areas make sense for this article?

The aim of this study was to evaluate drug–drug interactions between docetaxel and coadministered medicines in patients with breast cancer a claims database. The Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) database (2017 to 2019) was used in this study. We evaluated the risk of neutropenia (defined using receipt of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) prescriptions) under docetaxel administration or the coadministration of docetaxel and an interacting anticancer drug (predefined based on approval information obtained from the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety and the Lexicomp electronic database). The propensity score matching method was applied to balance covariates in the case (patients with G-CSF prescriptions) and control (patients without G-CSF prescriptions) groups. We identified 947 female patients with breast cancer prescribed with docetaxel and excluded 321 patients based on inclusion criteria. Of the remaining 626 patients, 280 were assigned to the case group and 346 to the control group. Predefined drugs were coadministered to 71 (11.3%) patients during the 7-day period before and after the administration of docetaxel. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) calculated using the logistic regression model applied to the propensity score matching showed no significant difference between the administration of docetaxel alone and docetaxel coadministration (adjusted OR, 2.010; 95% confidence interval, 0.906, 4.459). In conclusion, we suggest that coadministration of docetaxel and a predefined interacting drug are not associated with G-CSF prescription.</p><p><strong>Citation: </strong>Shin K-H, Ah Y-M, Cha SH, Choi HD (2023) Drug–Drug interactions of docetaxel in patients with breast cancer based on insurance claims data.

Despite the increasing interest in new anticancer drugs such as targeted agents and immunotherapy, cytotoxic anticancer drugs like docetaxel are still used in clinical settings [<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>]. For instance, combination regimens, which includes docetaxel, are recommended as first-line therapies for patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer [<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>].</p><p>Since the drug’s approval for medical use in 1995, safety information and other data on docetaxel have been reported. One of the common toxicities of docetaxel treatment is neutropenia [<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>], which can have a significant influence on the treatment of cancer and condition of the patient. In those who experience this side effect, careful observation and prophylactic treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) are recommended [<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. Additionally, patients with risk factors such as advanced age, infectious diseases, recent surgical history, renal or hepatic impairment, and drug interactions may experience worsening of their neutropenia [<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. More safety and toxicity data must be collected in addition to the information published to date to ensure the effective and safe treatment of breast cancer.</p><p>However, in the case of anticancer drugs, clinical trials on safety and toxicity are limited due to the high risks of adverse events and ethical issues, and there are few studies that address drug interactions. Cladribine, natalizumab, and upadacitinib are the common drugs contraindicated for coadministration with docetaxel [<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>], and caution is required when some drugs, such as cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors and platinum derivative, are coadministered [<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>]. When docetaxel and the abovementioned drugs are coadministered, treatment limitations and toxicities should be determined based on clinical observations.</p><p>This study was undertaken to evaluate drug–drug interactions (DDIs) when drugs are coadministered with docetaxel to patients with breast cancer using a nationwide claims database and the risk of neutropenia under docetaxel administration or the coadministration of docetaxel and a predefined drug.</p><h2>Methods</h2><h3>Data source</h3><p>Nested case–control study data were obtained from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) database, which is a repository of claims data used to reimburse healthcare providers in the Korean National Health Insurance (NHI) system. The HIRA database includes encrypted patient information including identification numbers, ages, genders, types of insurance, procedures, diagnosis, prescriptions, medical institution identifiers, and records and whether patients were treated as inpatients or outpatients. The collected prescription information included drug codes, days of supply, doses, and routes of administration. Diagnoses were coded according to the Korean Standard Classification of Diseases (Seventh Revision (KCD-7)). We used HIRA sample databases for 2017, 2018, and 2019 in this study, which included 3% of all NHI beneficiaries. The study protocol was reviewed by the Institutional Review Board of Yeungnam University (YU202010003), and the requirement for informed consent was waived because secondary data were used. Data from the NHI exclude information that enables the identification of individuals.</p><h3>Study groups and outcome measures</h3><p>Female breast cancer (KCD-7 code: C50) prescribed with docetaxel after their diagnosis of breast cancer and included in the HIRA patients sample database (2017–2019). Patients who met the following criteria were excluded: 1) a prescription of docetaxel or predefined interacting drugs before their first diagnosis of breast cancer, 2) a hematologic malignancy, and 3) a prescription of G-CSF before the prescription of docetaxel.</p><p>Interacting drugs were defined based on the approval information obtained from the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety and the Lexicomp electronic database (<a href=\"#pone.0287382.s001\">S1 Table</a>). Patients who had been prescribed G-CSF during the continuous administration of docetaxel were assigned to the case group (patients with G-CSF), while those who had not been prescribed G-CSF were assigned to the control group (patients without G-CSF). Continuous docetaxel administration was defined as the next administration of docetaxel identified within 28 days after the previous administration. The risk of neutropenia was defined as receipt of G-CSF prescriptions (<a href=\"#pone.0287382.s001\">S1 Table</a>).</p><h3>Covariates and statistical analysis</h3><p>Age, types of insurance, the period from first diagnosis of breast cancer to first administration of docetaxel, surgery for breast cancer, average dose of docetaxel administered per cycle, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) were evaluated [<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. Age was assessed at the time of the initial diagnosis of breast cancer, and following the diagnosis, surgery for breast cancer was checked before and after administration of docetaxel. Insurance types were decided at the first prescription of docetaxel. The time from the initial diagnosis of breast cancer to the first prescription of docetaxel was also evaluated, and the average dose of docetaxel administered per cycle was calculated during the continuous prescription of docetaxel. The CCI was applied to the adjustment using the comorbidity diagnosis code prior to the initial diagnosis of breast cancer (<a href=\"#pone.0287382.s002\">S2 Table</a>).</p><p>A nested case–control design was applied. In the nested case–control study, patients in the case group who had developed a disease during a specific time period were identified, and each patient was matched with other patients in the control group who had not developed the disease at the same period [<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. The propensity score matching (PSM) method was used to balance covariates in the case and control groups. PSM in the nested case–control study represents a conditional probability that patients will be assigned to the case group (with the prescription of G-CSF) under given covariates, including age, insurance types, the period from initial diagnosis of breast cancer to the first administration of docetaxel, surgery for breast cancer, the average dose of docetaxel administered per cycle, and CCI. Propensity scores (PSs) were calculated using a logistic regression model, in which the dependent variable was whether to assign the case group or the control group and the independent variables were the covariates mentioned above. The case and control groups were balanced for these covariates by 1:1 matching the PSs of individual patients by stratifying the administration of docetaxel into two strata (one cycle and more than two cycles). We evaluated standardized differences to determine a balance between groups before and after the PSM method; an absolute value for the standardized difference of &lt;10% was a relatively small imbalance [<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>].</p><p>Odds ratios (ORs) for the association between receipt of docetaxel or docetaxel and a predefined drug and outcome (G-CSF prescriptions) were calculated using logistic regression models applied to the PSM method. In addition, along with the cycles for the administration of docetaxel used as a stratification variable in the PSM process, covariates were adjusted for the models, such as age, type of insurance, surgery for breast cancer type, the length of period from the initial diagnosis of breast cancer to the first prescription of docetaxel, average docetaxel dose per administration cycle, and CCI [<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>].</p><p>Means, standard deviations, and percentiles were used as descriptive statistics. The statistical analysis was performed using an SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA), and statistical significance was accepted for p-values &lt;0.05.</p><p>For the validity assessment of the adjusted logistic regression model, we verified the linearity assumption for logit using the Box–Tidwell approach and determine whether there are any significant outliers with a Cook’s distance of greater than (4/the number of PS-matched patients) and absolute standardized residuals greater than 3. Additionally, the internal validation evaluation of the adjusted model was performed by yielding the value of AUC called an area under the ROC curve through 5-fold cross-validation [<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]. This analysis was performed using an R software version 4.2.3.</p><h2>Results</h2><h3>Population characteristics</h3><p>947 female patients with breast cancer prescribed with docetaxel were identified in the HIRA database (2017–2019). Excluded in this study were patients who were prescribed with docetaxel or interacting drugs before the initial diagnosis of breast cancer, patients with hematologic malignancy, or patients who were prescribed with G-CSF before the first docetaxel prescription. Of the 626 eligible patients, 280 of them had a record of G-CSF prescription (the case group), and the remaining 346 had no record of G-CSF prescription (the control group) (<a href=\"#pone-0287382-g001\">Fig 1</a>). Patient baseline characteristics are presented in <a href=\"#pone-0287382-t001\">Table 1</a>. When standardized differences of &gt;0.1 were considered significant, age, types of insurance, surgery for breast cancer after the administration of docetaxel, the period from the first diagnosis of breast cancer to the first administration of docetaxel, and average dose of docetaxel per administration cycle differed between the two groups. Because of the PSM according to the stratified cycles (one cycle or more than two cycles) of administered docetaxel, 238 patients in the case group who were prescribed with G-CSF due to neutropenia at the administration of docetaxel were matched with 238 patients in the control group without G-CSF prescription. Differences between baseline characteristics were not significant in the two groups as all absolute values of standardized differences were less than 0.1 when 238 patients in the two groups were matched (<a href=\"#pone-0287382-t002\">Table 2</a>). In other words, all covariates were balanced in both the case and control groups.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287382.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287382.g001</a></p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287382.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287382.t001</a></p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287382.t002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287382.t002</a></p><h3>Case–control study of drug–drug interactions</h3><p>Predefined drugs were coadministered with docetaxel 7 days before and after the administration of docetaxel in 71 (11.3%) patients. Although these combinations are not contraindicated, they should be used with caution. The most frequent combination was docetaxel plus carboplatin in both groups. Only 3 patients (0.5%) received DDI medications while receiving docetaxel therapy when anticancer medications were excluded from interactions with other drugs (<a href=\"#pone-0287382-t003\">Table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287382.t003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287382.t003</a></p><p><a href=\"#pone-0287382-t004\">Table 4</a> shows the ORs for associations between G-CSF prescriptions and docetaxel/coadministered drug interactions. Adjusted ORs calculated using the multivariate logistic regression model with stratified cycles (one cycle, more than two cycles) of administered docetaxel and covariates applied to the PSM method showed that the odds of G-CSF prescription were not significantly different in the case and control groups (adjusted OR, 2.010; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.906, 4.459), that is, that docetaxel and predefined drug interactions were not associated with G-CSF prescription. We also evaluated the chi-square test for logistic regression models [<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. As a result, the data for both groups were not statistically significant, which indicates a homogeneous probability for the risk of G-CSF prescription.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287382.t004\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287382.t004</a></p><p>Furthermore, the assumption of linearity between continuous covariates (the period from the first diagnosis of breast cancer to the first administration of docetaxel, average dose of docetaxel administered per cycle, CCI) and the logit transformation of binary outcome in the adjusted logistic regression model was evaluated using the Box–Tidwell test. In order to apply this approach, we added an interaction term between each continuous covariate and its logarithmic transformation to the model, and if the added interaction term for each covariate is statistically insignificant, associations between the corresponding covariate and the logit of binary outcome will prove to be linear [<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>].</p><p>We showed the regression coefficient estimates (95% CI), p-value, and Bayes factor (BF) for the interaction terms of three continuous covariates. First, for CCI, the estimate was −0.459 (95% CI: −0.920, 0.002), the p-value was 0.051, and BF was 0.307. Although its p-value was obtained close to 0.05, its BF was lower than 3 to 5, which is the value of BF corresponding to the p-value of 0.05, so the interaction term for CCI was statistically insignificant [<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. The other interaction terms for two continuous covariates (the period from the first diagnosis of breast cancer to the first administration of docetaxel: the regression coefficient estimate was 0.001 (95% CI: −0.005, 0.007), the p-value was 0.758, and BF was 0.048; an average dose of docetaxel administered per cycle: the regression coefficient estimate was 0.065 (95% CI: −0.012, 0.141), the p-value was 0.099, and BF was 0.179) were also statistically insignificant. In conclusion, three continuous covariates had linear relationships with the logit of the binary outcome in the adjusted logistic regression model.</p><p>As further validity assessments for the adjusted logistic regression model, we demonstrated the absence of influential outliers from the 476 PS-matched patients (although 31 of 476 patients with the Cook’s distance greater than 0.0084 (= 4/476) were influential to the model, there were no PS-matched patients with absolute standardized residuals greater than 3) [<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. Finally, we drew the ROC curve and then yielded the value of AUC to show the predictive ability for G-CSF prescription from the adjusted outcome model (AUC: 0.856) (<a href=\"#pone.0287382.s003\">S1 Fig</a>). We also performed 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate the internal validity of this model and obtained an average of the 5 AUC values (= 0.8385) [<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>].</p><h2>Discussion</h2><p>We identified docetaxel DDIs using real-world claims data. In addition, the risks of neutropenia (defined as receipt of a prescription of G-CSF) for docetaxel alone and docetaxel combined with a predefined drug were compared to assess the association between drug interactions and adverse events.</p><p>In this study, 11% of the patients with breast cancer who received docetaxel concurrently used clinically significant interacting medications. When we excluded anticancer medications from interacting medications, the prevalence of DDIs was only 0.5%. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate the prevalence of docetaxel drug–drug interactions using a nationwide database. Although direct comparisons are not possible due to the use of different study designs, anticancer agents, and databases, the two reported overall prevalences of DDIs for anticancer medications were 32.4% or 26.4%, and when limited to significant drug–drug interactions, the prevalences for anticancer medications were 28.4% or 9.7% [<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>].</p><p>Coadministration with carboplatin was the most frequent combination observed in this study, which results in a pharmacodynamic drug interaction. Docetaxel and carboplatin are often administered in combination because this therapy is recommended for patients with breast cancer [<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. Therefore, when this treatment is administered, the prophylactic use of G-CSF should be taken into account, and other risk factors of neutropenia should be assessed. Coadministration with clarithromycin or itraconazole can also induce a pharmacokinetic interaction [<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. Dronedarone is a medication that may induce a pharmacokinetic interaction in addition to cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors, although this has not been observed in the present study [<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>].</p><p>Patel <em>et al</em>. reported that the incidence of febrile neutropenia among patients with breast cancer who were administered with docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide was 9.4%, which is consistent with our findings [<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>]. Unfortunately, few studies have reported drug interactions for anticancer drugs. According to a retrospective cohort study that investigated the potential interaction between vinorelbine and clarithromycin, the estimated incidence of grade 4 neutropenia in patients receiving clarithromycin was higher than that in patients not receiving clarithromycin (31.6% and 2.5%, p = 0.0033) [<a href=\"#pone.0287382.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>]. Additionally, it was reported that vinorelbine dose and female sex were significantly correlated with severe neutropenia. However, we failed to identify a significant difference in neutropenia risk. This difference might be explained by the high distribution rate of electronic medical records and clinical decision support systems for prescribing anticancer medications, which makes preemptive therapy modifications possible based on considerations of DDIs and other risk factors for adverse drug events. Our findings indicate no additional risk of neutropenia in patients with breast cancer who were prescribed with docetaxel and other potential interacting drugs. However, given the impact of DDIs, we suggest exercising caution when interpreting our results and recommend further studies be undertaken.</p><p>Studies on the safety of docetaxel using real-world data are valuable because they provide an alternative that is not encumbered by ethical or financial considerations and avoid the drawbacks of clinical trials carried out in controlled environments. Nevertheless, our study has several limitations. First, despite the benefits of using claims data, it can be challenging to determine if a drug was actually administered or when it was administered. Second, neutropenia was defined as an adverse effect due to DDI, but the confirmation of the relationship between DDI and the occurrence of the actual adverse drug event is unclear. Third, we could not evaluate factors associated with patient status, such as body weight and ECOG performance status, or anticancer medication doses, because these were not recorded in the claims database. Finally, the sample database excluded patients who were diagnosed with neutropenia. A history of neutropenia is a significant risk factor and could be likely to have influenced observed outcomes; therefore, exclusion is considered reasonable.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>This study indicates that coadministration of docetaxel and a predefined interacting drug is not associated with prescription of G-CSF. However, this does not support the idea that drugs that cause potential neutropenia with docetaxel might be used safely. Moreover, this study shows that investigations based on real-world data make it possible to monitor and evaluate cancer treatment safety, thus improving patient care.</p><h2>Supporting information</h2><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287382.s001\">S1 Table. </a>Medication ingredient codes of predefined drugs and G-CSF.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287382.s001\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287382.s001</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(DOCX)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287382.s002\">S2 Table. </a>Charlson comorbidity indices (CCIs).</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287382.s002\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287382.s002</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(DOCX)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287382.s003\">S1 Fig. </a>ROC curve for the PS−matched logistic regression model.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287382.s003\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287382.s003</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(PDF)</p><h2>References</h2><h3>Subject Areas <div id=\"subjInfo\">?</div>\\n    <div id=\"subjInfoText\">\\n      <p>For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/PLOS/plos-thesaurus/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link opens in new window\">here</a>.</p>\\n      <span class=\"inline-intro\">We want your feedback.</span> Do these Subject Areas make sense for this article?

Those who are hospitalized at the time of first diagnosis may be at even greater risk of poor outcomes, as recent population-based data has described these people are over 13 times more likely to die within 5 years of diagnosis compared with age-matched, population-based controls due to suicide and unnatural deaths [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>]. Quality standards in both the USA [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>] and Canada [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>] have focused on post-discharge quality of care to address the problem of lengthy times to post-discharge follow up after a SSD-related hospitalization. In Ontario (Canada) timely outpatient follow-up within 7-days of an inpatient hospitalization discharge for a SSD is a quality indicator [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>]. Timely follow-up with a physician is important to monitor response and tolerability to treatment, assess safety, and support recovery as a person transitions back to the community following hospitalization.</p><p>At the present time we do not know what proportion of people who are discharged from hospital after a first diagnosis of SSD are seen within 7 days. Previous work from Ontario, Canada has estimated that only 45% of people were seen by a psychiatrist within 30 days of discharge [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>]. There is limited data on how other factors, specifically geographic factors may impact timely follow-up and quality of care for people with a SSD.</p><p>A previous meta-analysis of health service use and distance has shown that geographical factors impact health service use, and people who live closer to healthcare facilities have better health related outcomes [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. Although only three of the 108 studies included heterogenous samples of a variety of mental disorder including SSDs, the three studies included [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>] all found a distance decay effect, whereby health service use outcomes in heterogenous samples with mental disorders were inversely associated with how far a person resides from services. Additional studies that have recently been published focusing on people with a SSD in Nigeria [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>], Taiwan [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>] and the USA [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>] which have found distance to hospital impact the likelihood of missing a follow-up clinic appointment post-discharge [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>], impacted length of stay [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>], and be associated with rehospitalization [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. None of the previous studies focused on first episode psychosis. There is a dearth of research examining how geospatial factors like distance to services may impact service use and quality of care during an early phase of a SSD, particularly during the potentially high-risk period following hospitalization discharge.</p><p>The objectives of this study were to 1) estimate the proportion of people discharged with SSD in Ontario who received timely-follow up while accounting for geographical factors and 2) examine the association between distance from a person’s place of residence to hospital and timely follow-up while adjusting for potential confounding factors.</p><p>For the purpose of this study, we examined distance from hospital to a person’s residence (as opposed to a local outpatient service or provider) as based on previous work more than half of people in previous population-based cohorts in the province were not seen by outpatient services after discharge [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>]. Moreover, nearly all the specialized early psychosis intervention programs in the province are either hospital-based or located very close to a local hospital [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. Hospitals would also be most familiar with relevant services that are within local health regions and have more established referral pathways to services that are closer.</p><h2>Methods</h2><h3>Study design</h3><p>We used administrative health data from ICES to construct a retrospective cohort of Ontario residents ages 16 to 40 years who were discharged from a hospitalization with an incident diagnosis of SSD between January 1, 2012 and March 31, 2019. People were followed up for 30 days after hospital discharge. These ages were used as they 1) overlap with many of the early psychosis intervention program age criteria in Ontario, and 2) provide coverage beyond age 30 which is closer to the actual the mean age of diagnosis of a SSD in Ontario (32.5 years) [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>]. The follow-up period was prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic during which there was a rapid update of virtual care [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>].</p><h3>Setting</h3><p>Ontario is a Canadian province with a population of approximately 14 million people and has a single-payer universal healthcare system. The province is approximately 1 million km<sup>2</sup> and has a large geographic spread. Historically there have been 14 Local Health Integration Network (LHIN) regions (<a href=\"#pone.0287334.s001\">S1 Appendix</a>) that range in size and contain 1 to 2 million people and have been used for the purposes of integration, funding, and planning health care. The LHINs are further subdivided into 97 primary sub-LHINs. For this study, we used LHIN regions and sub-LHIN regions for geospatial analyses and multi-level modeling.</p><h3>Data</h3><p>The datasets used were linked using unique encoded identifiers and analyzed at ICES. ICES is an independent, non-profit research institute whose legal status under Ontario’s health information privacy law allows it to collect and analyze health care and demographic data, without consent, for health system evaluation and improvement.</p><p>The data sources included the Registered Persons Database; the Ontario Mental Health Reporting System (OMHRS); the Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database; the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System; the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) claims database; the ICES Physician Database; information about Ontario health care institutions funded by the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care; Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada Permanent Residents database; the Ontario Marginalization Index; the Postal Code Conversion File; Ontario Road Network; and the Canadian Census of Population. Further details on the data sources are presented in <a href=\"#pone.0287334.s002\">S2 Appendix</a>.</p><h3>Case definition</h3><p>We ascertained incident or “first-episode” cases of SSD during a hospitalization by ensuring that people included in the cohort had no previous SSD diagnosis. We included all first hospitalizations with a discharge diagnosis of Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder and Psychotic Disorder NOS based on DSM-IV / ICD-9 codes (295,298) and ICD-10-CA codes (F20, F25, F29) [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. All people included in the cohort were residents of Ontario and eligible for OHIP coverage, had at least a 5-year lookback period to ascertain if cases were incident, had a hospitalization length of stay greater than 3 days to ensure sufficient time for diagnosis, and had a length of stay no longer than 90 days as long stays are not common in this clinical population. We also excluded forensic hospitalizations as outpatient care pathways differ in the forensic system. Finally, we restricted our regression models to a subset of the cohort who were hospitalized in designated mental health beds that reported detailed clinical assessment to OMHRS, because this contains information on clinical factors important for understanding physician follow-up [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>].</p><h3>Exposure: Distance</h3><p>The exposure of interest was the straight line (Euclidian) distance between the discharging hospital and a person’s place of residence. This was calculated based on location of residence at the time of hospitalization discharge and the location of the hospital.</p><h3>Outcomes: Physician follow-up</h3><p>Our primary outcome was defined as follow-up vs. no follow-up with a psychiatrist within 7 days post-discharge. We focused on the 7-day time window to reflect Ontario’s quality standard for follow-up for people with SSD post-discharge.</p><p>Our secondary outcomes included: follow-up vs. no follow-up with a psychiatrist within 30 days post-discharge, follow-up vs. no follow-up with any physician (psychiatrist or FP) within 7 days post-discharge, and follow-up vs. no follow-up with any physician within 30 days post-discharge.</p><p>FP follow-up was included as part of our secondary outcomes as FPs play an important role in providing mental health services to this population in Ontario [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>]. Considering FPs may provide mental health services as part of a general medical visit [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>] specific mental health billing codes were not used, and any visit to a FP during the follow-up period was included.</p><h3>Covariates</h3><p>We included covariates that were known to impact physician follow-up in this population [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>] and were available in the health administrative data. Further details on the rational for covariate inclusion, covariate categorization and the conceptual framework are included in <a href=\"#pone.0287334.s003\">S3 Appendix</a>.</p><p>Sociodemographic factors included age, sex, immigrant status, housing stability, and living arrangements.</p><p>Socioenvironmental factors included rural residence based on the Rurality Index of Ontario [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>] and area-level marginalization based on the Ontario Marginalization Index (ON-Marg) which includes material deprivation, residential instability, dependency and ethnic concentration dimensions [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>]. We also assigned all people to one of the 14 LHINs and 97 primary sub-LHINs based on residence at the time of discharge.</p><p>Clinical factors included diagnosis (dichotomized as either schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder or psychosis NOS), length of stay in hospital, as well as history of problematic substance use, Positive Symptom Scale (PSS), involuntary admission, and insight (full, limited or no insight) which were based on RAI-MH assessment data.</p><p>At the hospital level we differentiated between community and academic hospitals. From a service use perspective, we identified any previous contact in the year prior to hospitalization with a psychiatrist, with a FP, any previous ED visits for any mental health reason, and any mental health hospitalization for a reason other than a SSD. Temporally, we also captured the year of discharge to account for potential changes in the structure and funding of mental health services during the study period.</p><h3>Analysis</h3><p>We first calculated the crude proportion of people in the entire cohort and in each LHIN for each outcome. Considering that crude proportions do not account for differences in population size across the LHINs, we used the 2016 population estimate in each LHIN based on the 2016 Canadian Census to calculate standardized event ratios (SER). We visualized SER for each outcome of interest using choropleth maps at the LHIN-level for the entire province. A SER less than 1 indicates there was a lower proportion of people with physician follow-up in a region than expected, and a SER greater than 1 indicates there was a larger proportion of people with follow-up than expected.</p><p>We described the characteristics of the analytic cohort stratified by our primary outcome using standardized differences [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>].</p><p>We used a log base 2 transformation of the distance variable due to the wide range and right-skewed distribution. The odds ratio (OR) of this transformation can be interpreted as the change in the odds for every 2-fold increase in distance. Considering the transformed variable was linearly associated with the logit of the outcome, did not change the statistical significance of the exposure estimates, and did not change the estimates of other variables in the models, we reported the log base 2 transformation for all models.</p><p>We first fit multilevel logistic regression models for all outcomes of interest with random intercepts at the sub-LHIN region level and no predictor variables. Random intercepts were fit at the sub-LHIN region level to account for the nested structure (people receiving care within health administrative regions) and clustering within these smaller geographic regions. All further multilevel models were fit with random intercepts at the sub-LHIN level.</p><p>We used the null models with only the random intercept and no predictor variables to estimate general contextual effects, which provide information on between-cluster variances at the sub-LHIN region level for all outcomes of interest. We calculated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) to quantify the variation in the outcomes attributable to the sub-LHIN level [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>]. Median odds ratio (MOR) were also calculated and can be interpreted as the median increase in the odds ratio as one moves from an area with a low proportion of follow-up to a high proportion area [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>].</p><p>We then proceeded to fit unadjusted multilevel logistic regression models and then fit adjusted models for all outcomes of interest with our exposure of interest and covariates. The null models and unadjusted models fit with the primary exposure were used to assess the fit of the fully adjusted models. All effect estimates were presented as ORs with 95% confidence intervals. Estimates were considered significant at the p&lt;0.05 level when the confidence intervals did not overlap with unity.</p><p>We conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of potential exposure misclassification, which included comparing model estimates with alternative ways of measuring the primary exposure of interest, including drive time and driving distance from hospital to a person’s residence. Additional sensitivity analyses restricted the sample based on housing stability and extreme distances.</p><p>We used R 3.1.2 [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>] to conduct descriptive analyses and to visualize data, Stata 15.1 [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>] for regression analyses, and ArcGIS 10.2 [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>] for network analyses for the sensitivity analyses.</p><h3>Ethics approval</h3><p>The study was approved by the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Research Ethics Board, Toronto, Canada. Individual informed consent was waived. The study data was de-identified prior to analysis.</p><h2>Results</h2><p>We identified 25,637 total hospitalizations for SSD between January 1, 2012 and March 31, 2019. Of these, 6,382 hospitalizations were for an incident diagnosis of SSD and met the inclusion criteria and were included in the descriptive analysis. Of these hospitalizations 5,882 were discharges from a psychiatric inpatient unit and were included in the analytic sample that used detailed clinical data. The characteristics of the full cohort are presented in <a href=\"#pone-0287334-t001\">Table 1</a>, and the characteristics of the analytic sample stratified by the primary outcome are presented in <a href=\"#pone.0287334.s004\">S4 Appendix</a>.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287334.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287334.t001</a></p><p>Only 14% of the analytic cohort received psychiatric follow-up within 7 days post-discharge. The median distance between a person’s residence and the discharging hospital was 8.0 km (IQR: 3.8 km, 18.4 km) in the group that received follow-up with a psychiatrist within 7 days post-discharge, compared to 9.71 km (IQR: 3.9 km, 24.09 km) in the group that did not receive follow-up.</p><p>A greater median length of stay was observed for people who had follow-up with a psychiatrist post-discharge. We observed a greater proportion of people who were admitted to hospital involuntarily in the group that received follow-up by a psychiatrist. Furthermore, a greater proportion of people in the group who were seen by a psychiatrist within 7 days resided in urban areas with greater levels of ethnic concentration. We also observed a greater proportion of people admitted to academic hospitals who were seen by a psychiatrist within 7 days post-discharge. With respect to previous service use, a greater proportion of people who received follow-up with a psychiatrist had previous contact with a psychiatrist and FPs within 1 year prior to hospitalization.</p><h3>Follow-up by Local Health Integration Network</h3><p>Only 14.2% of the entire cohort had a visit with a psychiatrist within 7 days post-discharge. The crude proportion of the cohort receiving follow-up differed between LHINs and ranged between 4.8% to 27.6% of the cohort receiving follow-up with a psychiatrist within 7 days post-discharge. Almost half of the entire cohort (49.6%) were seen by a psychiatrist within 30 days post-discharge, and this ranged between 17.7% to 63.2% based on region.</p><p>Visualization of the SERs for all outcomes by LHIN are presented in <a href=\"#pone-0287334-g001\">Fig 1</a>. Overall, there was a similar pattern across all outcomes, with a greater than expected level of follow-up in the LHINs with the largest urban centers (Toronto Central LHIN, followed by the Champlain and the Hamilton-Niagara-Haldimand-Brant LHINs).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>Notes: LHINs with the top 10% SERs are highlighted in red, SER = standardized event ratios, PSYCH7 = Follow-up with a psychiatrist within 7 days of hospitalization discharge, PYCH30 = Follow-up with a psychiatrist within 30 days of hospitalization discharge, ANY7 = Follow-up with any physician within 7 days of hospitalization discharge, ANY30 = Follow-up with any physician within 30 days of hospitalization discharge. <em>*This figure contains information licensed under the Open Government Licence–Ontario, <a href=\"https://www.ontario.ca/page/open-government-licence-ontario\">https://www.ontario.ca/page/open-government-licence-ontario</a></em>.</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287334.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287334.g001</a></p><h3>Contextual effects at the regional level</h3><p>An ICC of 0.10 (95% CI = 0.05 to 0.16) indicated that 10% of the variance occurred at the sub-LHIN region level for the primary outcome, follow-up with a psychiatrist within 7 days. A MOR of 1.80 indicated that the sub-LHIN regions with the greatest odds of follow-up had an 80% increased odds of follow-up when compared to the regions with the lowest odds of follow-up. ICCs for secondary outcomes ranged between 0.15 (95% CI = 0.11 to 0.21) for follow-up with a psychiatrist within 30 days and 0.03 (95% CI = 0.01 to 0.06) for FP follow-up within 7 days.

However, distance was independently associated with the secondary outcome of follow-up with a psychiatrist within 30 days post-discharge. In the fully adjusted model, there was a 4% reduction in the odds of follow-up for every 2-fold increase in distance between a person’s residence and location of hospitalization (aOR 0.96, 95% CI = 0.92 to 0.99). Distance was not associated with follow-up with any physician within 7 days post-discharge (aOR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.97 to 1.05) or 30 days post-discharge (aOR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.95 to 1.02).</p><h3>Secondary effects</h3><p>The primary effect estimates (between distance and follow-up) were obtained from models constructed to obtain unbiased effect estimates of this relationship. Unadjusted and adjusted estimates for all covariates are also presented for completeness (Tables <a href=\"#pone-0287334-t003\">3</a>–<a href=\"#pone-0287334-t006\">6</a>). These secondary effects must be interpreted with caution, as these estimates may be biased due to the models not being constructed to obtain unconfounded estimates of the relationship between the secondary exposures and outcomes for people with a history of substance use [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>].</p><p>In the adjusted model estimating the odds of psychiatric follow-up within 7 days of discharge (<a href=\"#pone-0287334-t003\">Table 3</a>) there was a statistically significant increase in the odds of follow-up in areas with moderate levels of dependency (Q3), areas with higher levels of ethnic concentration (Q3,Q4), for people who were admitted voluntarily, admitted to a teaching hospital, had a longer length of stay and had previous psychiatric contact. There was a statistically significant reduction in the odds of follow-up with a psychiatrist within 7 days of discharge if a person had a history of substance use and with each increasing year in the cohort during which an admission occurred.</p><p>In the adjusted model for psychiatric follow-up within 3 days of discharge (<a href=\"#pone-0287334-t004\">Table 4</a>) there was a statistically significant increase in the odds of follow-up in areas with higher levels of ethnic concentration (Q3,Q4), for people with a greater length of stay, and had previous contact with a psychiatrist prior to the hospitalization. As reported in the primary effects section, there was statistically significant and independent association between distance and follow-up with a psychiatrist within 30 days of follow-up, whereby there was a reduction in the in the odds of follow-up for every 2-fold increase in distance between a person’s residence and location of hospitalization. Furthermore, in the adjusted model there was also a statistically significant reduction in the odds of follow-up if a person lived alone, lived in a rural area, used substances, had no insight and had a previous mental health hospitalization not for a SSD, and with each increasing calendar year during the cohort period.</p><p>In the adjusted model estimating the odds of any physician follow-up within 7 days of discharge (<a href=\"#pone-0287334-t005\">Table 5</a>) there was a statistically significant increase in the odds of follow-up in areas with moderate to high levels of ethnic concentration (Q3,Q4,Q5), moderate residential instability (Q3), in people with a longer length of stay in hospital, admitted to a teaching hospital and had previous contact with a family physician in the year prior to hospitalization. There was a statistically significant reduction in the odds of follow-up if a person lived alone and with each increasing calendar year during the cohort period.</p><p>In the adjusted model estimating any physician follow-up within 30 days of discharge there was a statistically significant increase in the odds of follow-up in areas with higher levels of ethnic concentration (Q4,Q5), and if a person was admitted as a voluntary patient, spent a longer time in hospital, and had contact with a psychiatrist or family physician for mental health reasons in the year prior to admission. There was a statistically significant reduction in the odds of follow-up if a person lived alone, in areas with higher levels of deprivation (Q5), if a person uses substances, has limited or no insight, and had a mental health hospitalization for a disorder other than a SSD in the year prior to the admission.</p><h3>Sensitivity analyses</h3><p>We found no substantive change in estimates or significance when we compared models using Euclidian distance to models with alternative definitions of the exposure specifically, driving distance and driving time. Moreover, model estimates from sensitivity analyses that restricted the sample based on housing stability and extreme distances did not suggest misclassification of the primary exposure. Further details on the sensitivity analyses are presented in <a href=\"#pone.0287334.s005\">S5 Appendix</a>.</p><h2>Discussion</h2><p>Less than 3 out of every 20 people who are discharged from hospital in Ontario after a new diagnosis of SSD received follow-up with a psychiatrist within 7 days. Outpatient follow-up within 7 days post-discharge is the quality standard in Ontario for all people with schizophrenia during any phase of the illness [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>]. Within 30 days post-discharge, slightly less than half of all people in the cohort were seen by a psychiatrist. In a similar clinical sample from the same jurisdiction but from an earlier time period (1999 and 2009) 44.8% of all people with a new diagnosis of SSD received outpatient follow-up with a psychiatrist within 30 days post-discharge [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>]. Although our current study found a slight improvement in the proportion of people who received follow-up with a psychiatrist within 30 days post-discharge, it remains that less than half of all people who are hospitalized at first diagnosis with SSD receive follow-up care with a psychiatrist within 30 days post-discharge, and this trend has persisted over two decades.</p><p>Our findings also highlight disparities in post-discharge quality of care based on where a person resides in the province. The greatest proportion of people who received timely follow-up across all outcomes live in the health regions which include the largest metropolitan centers in the province (i.e., Toronto, Ottawa, and Hamilton).</p><p>The low proportion of follow-up we observed outside of the large metropolitan centers is in keeping with the unequal distribution of psychiatrists across the province [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>]; however, other factors including the structure and delivery of mental health services must also be considered. From a policy perspective further consideration of the incentivization of quality care would be reasonable to examine despite initial negative studies [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref038\" class=\"ref-tip\">38</a>]. Unlike previous work which has focused on broader populations, it would be warranted to study incentives targeted to specific clinical population based on service need and geography. It is unlikely that incentivization of care alone will improve quality, and alternative models to standard mental health care delivery that are both more efficient and responsive to the care needs of service users should also be considered.</p><p>We found no association between the distance from a person’s place of residence and the discharging hospital and the primary outcome of follow-up with a psychiatrist within 7 days post-discharge. However, we found a modest association between our secondary outcome of psychiatric follow-up within 30 days post-discharge with distance. These findings are suggestive of a distance decay effect when examined for specific types of physician follow-up within 30 days of hospitalization discharge. This finding is consistent with the literature on this topic from other areas of health care [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>] and in similar clinical populations [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. The fact that we did not find a significant association between distance and the outcomes that assessed care contacts within 7 days of discharge may be due to only a small proportion of the sample receiving follow-up within 7 days of hospitalization discharge. Moreover, it is possible that care received within 7 days of hospitalization discharge may be driven by factors other than distance, specifically factors like past service use, which may be more strongly associated with follow-up.</p><p>Further replication and examination is warranted to determine the degree of clinical significance of this distance decay finding, considering other factors (e.g., past service use and clinical factors) may be more strongly associated with follow-up. It may also be important to consider how distance may impact length of stay in hospital and the risk of rehospitalization, as previously examined in non-first episode cohorts of people with SSD diagnoses [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. Clinically, our results support the fact that greater care should be taken when discharging people from a first inpatient hospitalization who live further away from hospital and in specific regions where there may be poor access to services.</p><p>Several secondary exposures (ranging from area level marginalization, rurality, past psychiatric follow-up, family physician follow-up, substance use, level of insight, length of stay and year of admission) were associated with the odds of follow-up, it is important to note the adjusted models were built to obtain unbiased estimates of the primary exposure of distance on the outcomes of interest. These findings are not surprising and are in keeping with previous literature which has found sociodemographic, socioenvironmental, clinical, service use, hospital and temporal factors to all be associated with follow-up in this clinical population [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>]. Although the secondary exposure estimates may be biased, these associations warrant further examination in future work.</p><p>It is also important to note that the delivery of outpatient services has rapidly changed since March 2020 in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The pandemic has generated a swift reconfiguration of service delivery to virtual care, including telepsychiatry [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>] which has historically been underutilized [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>]. Prior to March 2020, telepsychiatry had been identified as an avenue to improve poor rates of post-discharge care to people with mental health needs [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>] and as a means to improve disparities in physician supply that exist between regions. Yet, challenges and barriers to the use of virtual care [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>] may also be determined in part by geography (e.g., access to highspeed internet to successfully use a virtual platform, having a suitable location to privately meet with a provider virtually). Further examination of the use of virtual care in populations with SSD in relation to post-discharge follow-up should be undertaken.</p><h3>Strengths and limitations</h3><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study that examines the impact of geospatial factors and distance on post-discharge quality of care among people with SSD. The focus on people diagnosed after first hospitalization is also a specific population that may be at a greater risk of negative outcomes. We also conducted sensitivity analyses to ensure our exposure of interest was not misclassified.</p><p>Although we excluded people with prior diagnoses of SSD, we were not able to account for people with affective psychoses (e.g., bipolar I disorder), who are at risk of diagnostic transition [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>] and may be diagnosed with SSD during a hospitalization. This is important as people with affective psychoses are eligible for specialized mental health services like early psychosis intervention programs [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>] that also provide services to people with SSD, which may impact service use post-discharge. We also restricted our regression analyses to people who had been discharged from a psychiatric bed (92.2% of all hospitalizations), as non-psychiatric beds do not report data to OMHRS which includes important clinical data that may confound the exposure-outcome relationship we were interested in.</p><p>We focused on physician services and could not account for contacts with non-physicians including nurses, case managers, social workers, and psychologists who all provide important aspects of care to this clinical population. Outpatient contacts with non-physician providers post-discharge would also meet the Ontario quality standard. Moreover, we were not able to ascertain whether a follow-up visit was arranged (which is the standard of care) but the person failed to attend, or if an appointment was never booked using the health administrative data available. Future studies may consider linking institutional and clinic-level data to examine these factors further. We were also unable to account for follow-up care which may have occurred outside of Ontario, which may be more likely to occur in regions bordering other provinces.</p><p>This study focused on one distance exposure, however other distance exposures may be important to consider in the context of post-discharge quality of care (e.g., the distance between a person’s residence to their outpatient provider). As noted, nearly all early psychosis intervention programs in the province are either hospital based or located near a hospital [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>] and many people in this clinical population do not receive any outpatient care [<a href=\"#pone.0287334.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>]. The exposure used for this study is a reasonable one to focus on considering the study’s emphasis on post-hospitalization discharge quality of care as well as the novel nature of this work in this clinical population and jurisdiction. This study highlights that it may be feasible to further examine other geospatial exposures in future work.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>Very few people who are diagnosed with SSD at the time of a first hospitalization received timely follow-up with a psychiatrist post-discharge in Ontario, Canada. Whether a person received follow-up care differs based on where they reside in the province. We did not find distance to be associated with psychiatric follow-up within 7 days post-discharge, however, increasing distance was independently associated with a reduction in the odds of psychiatric follow-up within 30 days post-discharge.</p><p>Our findings support the need for further work to evaluate the impact of geospatial factors on post-discharge quality of care and downstream outcomes in this clinical population. We need to consider developing, implementing, and evaluating interventions to improve post-discharge follow-up for people who have been diagnosed with SSD during a hospitalization.</p><h2>Supporting information</h2><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287334.s001\">S1 Appendix. </a>Location of the 14 Local Health Integration Network (LHIN) regions in Ontario.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287334.s001\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287334.s001</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(DOCX)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287334.s002\">S2 Appendix. </a>Description of data sources.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287334.s002\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287334.s002</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(DOCX)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287334.s003\">S3 Appendix. </a>Covariate description, categorization and conceptual framework.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287334.s003\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287334.s003</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(DOCX)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287334.s004\">S4 Appendix. </a>Characteristics of the analytic cohort who received follow-up with psychiatrist within 7 days of hospitalization discharge vs. those who did not (n = 5,882).</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287334.s004\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287334.s004</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(DOCX)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287334.s005\">S5 Appendix. </a>Sensitivity analyses.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287334.s005\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287334.s005</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(DOCX)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287334.s006\">S6 Appendix. </a>Dataset creation plan.</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287334.s006\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287334.s006</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(DOCX)</p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>Parts of this material are based on data and information compiled and provided by: the Ontario Ministry of Health (MOH), Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI).

Introduction</h2><p>Acute lung injury (ALI) is one of the most common acute and critical clinical conditions caused by gram-negative bacterial infection, bacterial outer membrane lipopolysaccharide activation of inflammatory cells, release of a large number of inflammatory factors, and further development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. The pathogenesis of ALI is often accompanied by pulmonary edema and accumulation of inflammatory cells, and the pathogenesis of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is closely related to ALI development. Currently, no specific drug is available for this disease in clinical practice [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>]. Therefore, the discovery of herbs with the potential to prevent ALI is crucial. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the main toxic component of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria. When the body suffers from a severe infection or multifactorial injury that increases the permeability of the intestinal mucosa, sepsis can develop due to an increase in LPS [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>], which can further induce ALI. The current animal models for the induction of ALI mostly involve the intraperitoneal injection of LPS, but intraperitoneal injection does not adequately simulate the pathogenesis and mechanism of ALI. Therefore, this experiment used tracheal drip LPS to induce an in vivo model of ALI.</p><p>Chinese cordyceps is a fungal complex formed by parasitic <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> mushrooms on the larvae of insects of the bat moth family, mainly distributed on the Tibetan plateau 2500 m above sea level. Currently, <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> mycelia are cultivated in vitro and is widely used as a substitute for <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> in pharmaceutical and herbal products [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>]. <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> has a long history in the treatment of lung diseases [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>], and modern pharmacology confirms that it has a very positive effect on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis (PIF) [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. However, studies on the prevention of LPS-induced ALI using <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> are lacking. Therefore, in this experiment tracheal drip LPS was used to induce an in vivo model of ALI, which could contribute to the prevention of COVID-19.</p><p>Metabolomics is a major branch of histology [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>] and is mainly used to study dynamic changes in various small molecule metabolites, including amino acids and fatty acids. High-throughput chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques, combined with statistical methods for data analysis, are used to identify and quantify metabolites in biological samples, thus reflecting the overall functions of complex living organisms. The metabolic profile of disease occurrence and drug treatment can be clearly obtained from the holistic, correlative, and dynamic nature of metabolomics in the analysis. In recent years, metabolomics has been increasingly used in the field of medicine [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>], particularly in the study of disease mechanisms [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. Combined with metabolomics, studying the prevention of ALI by <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> mycelia is of great significance.</p><h2>2. Materials and methods</h2><h3>2.1 Preparation of <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> mycelium solution</h3><p>We added 100 g of potato powder, 10 g of glucose, 9 g of agar, 5 g of yeast, and 2.5 g of peptone to 500 mL of distilled water. The mixture was sterilized at 121°C at 10<sup>5</sup> Pa for 30 min and introduced into a culture dish in a sterile environment to form 24 solid media. Wild <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> collected from the Baima Snow Mountain in Yunnan Province in June 2022 was inoculated onto the culture medium using tissue separation method. A room at 16.5°C for 4 months to obtain <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> mycelium was incubated. After further removing the culture medium, 20 g of fresh <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> mycelia was obtained by artificial culture, dried at 45°C for 10 h, ground into fine powder, and passed through a 100-mesh sieve. Distilled water was added to 1.5 g of <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> mycelia to make 45 mg/mL of <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> mycelium solution. The solution was set aside at 4°C [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>].</p><h3>2.2 Grouping of animals and drug administration</h3><p>The animals were housed at a temperature of 20±2°C and relative humidity of 55±5%, with a 12-h alternating day and night environment and free access to food and water. Animal experiments were approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Yunnan University (approval number: YNU20230536). In total, 24 mice were randomly divided into the normal (NS), model (LPS), <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> mycelia (OS) groups, and dexamethasone solution was used for positive control (DXM) groups. On the first day of the experiment, mice in the NS and LPS groups were intraperitoneally injected with physiological saline, and the OS and DXM groups were injected with <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> mycelium solution (45 mg/mL) and dexamethasone solution, respectively, for 7 consecutive days. On the 7<sup>th</sup> day, mice in the LPS, OS, and DXM groups were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium for 1 h. The trachea of mice was exposed through surgery, and tracheal puncture was performed using a miniature sampler. LPS solution (5 mg/kg) was dropped into the body of mice to establish an acute lung injury model. In the NS group, after administering physiological saline for 1 h on the 7<sup>th</sup> day, the mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium for 1 h, and sterile saline was dripped with a mini-syringe for tracheal puncture. Blood was collected from the orbital plexus of each of the mice 6 h after the establishment of an acute lung injury model in each group, the collected blood was placed in ice cubes, and the serum was separated after centrifugation at 3500 r*min-1 for 10 min and stored in a refrigerator at −80°C.</p><h3>2.3 LPS-induced ALI</h3><p>In the experimental LPS-induced ALI, mice were first anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of 1% sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg). The limbs and teeth of the anesthetized mice were fixed and disinfected by wiping with 75% alcohol, and an incision was made longitudinally along the central neck of the mice to expose the tracheal cartilage ring. The microinjector was fed toward the proximal level, LPS was slowly injected, and sterile saline was injected into the NS group. The microsampler was withdrawn, and the mice were immediately placed upright and rotated for 2 weeks before suturing the wound.</p><h3>2.4 Lung wet/dry weight ratio</h3><p>The body masses of the mice were weighed before sampling. The mice were deeply anesthetized, and the entire lung was taken out. Residual blood was aspirated using wet cotton. The weight of the middle lobe of the right lung was measured and recorded (marked as wet weight). Afterwards, the sample was placed in an oven at a temperature of 60°C for 24 consecutive h. The weight was measured and recorded again (marked as dry weight), and the lung coefficient was calculated according to the following formula: lung coefficient/% = lung wet/dry weight ratio × 100%.The results were analyzed statistically using SPSS 22.0 software (IBM Corp.; Armonk, NY, USA), and the data obeying the measures were expressed as x ± sd. If the squares were equal, a one-way analysis of variance and q-test were performed; if the squares were not equal, the analysis was performed by the rank sum test for multiple sample comparison, and two independent samples were analyzed by the rank sum test for two-group comparison.</p><h3>2.5 H&amp;E staining for lung histopathological changes</h3><p>The lung samples were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Tissue blocks were cut into 5-μm slices, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), and analyzed under a light microscope.</p><h3>2.6 Observation and analysis under a light microscope</h3><p>The samples were fixed overnight at 4°C using 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1-M PB (PH, 7.2) and washed with 0.1-M PB (PH, 7.2) three times for 7 min. Afterwards, samples were postfixed with 1% OsO<sub>4</sub> and 1.5% K<sub>4</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub> for 2 h at 4°C and washed with ddH<sub>2</sub>O three times for 7 min, followed by serial ethanol dehydration and acetone transition for 5 min. They were embedded in SPI pon 812 resin and underwent polymerization at 60°C for 48 h. Serial sections with uniform thicknesses (60 nm) were prepared using a Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome. Ultrathin sections were loaded onto copper grids and double-stained with 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate before observation under a JEM-1400 Plus transmission electron microscope at 80 kv.</p><h3>2.7 Serum metabolite extraction</h3><p>During the sample mass spectrometry process, 9 quality control (QC) samples were interspersed. Data quality was evaluated through the repeatability of QC sample testing. Serum samples, stored at −80°C, including sample preparation QC, were placed in a refrigerator at 4°C to thaw until no ice cubes were visible. Thereafter, 100 μL of each sample (including QC) were added to the EP tube, and the remaining samples were frozen. Subsequently, 700 μL of extractant containing internal standard 1 (methanol: acetonitrile: water = 4:2:1, V/V/V) was added, shaken for 1 min, and placed in a refrigerator at −20°C for 2 h. The samples were centrifuged at 25,000 × g at 4°C for 15 min. Samples were subsequently removed from the centrifuge, and 600 μL of the supernatant was transferred to a split new EP tube. A drying machine was used for drying, and 180 μL of methanol: pure water (1:1 v/v) solution was added and vortexed for 10 min until all dissolved in the reconstituted solution. It was subsequently centrifuged at 25,000 × g at 4°C for 15 min. The supernatant was moved to a new EP tube, and 20 μL of each sample was mixed into QC samples. The prepared supernatant was subjected to LC-MS/MS.</p><h3>2.8 UPLC-MS analysis</h3><p>A Water 2777c UPLC (Waters, USA) in series with a Q Exactive HF high-resolution mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for the separation and detection of metabolites. Chromatographic conditions were as follows: Chromatographic separation was performed on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (1.7 μm, 2.1 mm × 100 mm, Waters, USA), and the column temperature was maintained at 45°C [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]. The mobile phase comprised 0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile (B) in the positive mode and 10 mM ammonium formate (A) and acetonitrile (B) in the negative mode. The gradient conditions were as follows: 0–1 min, 2% B; 1–9 min, 2%–98% B; 9–12 min, 98% B; 12–12.1 min, 98%–2% B; and 12.1–15 min, 2% B. The flow rate was 0.35 mL/min, and the injection volume was 5 μL. Mass spectrometry conditions were as follows: Primary and secondary mass spectrometry data were acquired using Q Exactive HF (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The full scan range was 70–1050 m/z with a resolution of 120,000, and the automatic gain control (AGC) target for MS acquisition was set to 3e6 with a maximum ion injection time of 100 ms. The top three precursors were selected for subsequent MSMS fragmentation with a maximum ion injection time of 50 ms and a resolution of 30,000; the AGC was 1e5. The stepped normalized collision energies were set as 20, 40, and 60 eV. ESI parameters were set as follows: the sheath gas flow rate was 40; auxiliary gas flow rate was 10; positive-ion mode, spray voltage (|KV|) was 3.80; negative-ion mode, spray voltage (|KV|) was 3.20; capillary temperature was 320°C; and auxiliary gas heater temperature was 350°C [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>].</p><h3>2.9 Metabolite ion peak extraction and metabolite identification</h3><p>After importing the offline mass spectrometry data into Compound Discoverer v.3.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and analyzing the mass spectrometry data, in combination with the BGI metabolome database (bmdb), mzcloud database, and chemspider online database, a data matrix containing information such as metabolite peak area and identification results was obtained. Subsequently, the table was further analyzed and processed. Parameters were set as follows: parent ion mass deviation, &lt;5 ppm; mass deviation of fragment ions, &lt;10 ppm; and retention time deviation, &lt;0.2 min. The official website link is <a href=\"https://mycompounddiscoverer.com/\">https://mycompounddiscoverer.com/</a>. The statistics of the metabolites with identification information were based on their final classes.</p><h3>2.10 Data preprocessing and statistical analysis</h3><p>The result file from Compound Discoverer was input into MetaX for data preprocessing and further analysis. Data preprocessing included the following steps: 1) Data was normalized to obtain relative peak areas by probabilistic quotient normalization [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]. 2) Using quality control-based robust LOESS [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>], signal correction was implemented to correct for batch effects. 3) Metabolites were removed with a coefficient of variation &gt;30% of their relative peak areas in the removed QC samples. PCA and PLS-DA were performed using SIMCA software Version 14.1 (Umetrics AB, Umeå, Sweden). The fold change of each metabolite in each comparison group was calculated, and Student’s t-test was used to test the significance of the expression of each metabolite in each comparison group to obtain p-values. A <em>P</em>-value was used to evaluate the significance level of the difference between the two groups of samples. Fold change measures whether the mean value of metabolites in both sample groups changed, and the p-value measures whether the change is statistically significant. Only metabolites with fold change values of ≥1.2 or ≤0.83 and <em>P</em>-values of &lt;0.05 can be classified as differential metabolites. The metabolic pathway analysis of the differentially expressed metabolites was performed by the online tool MetaboAnalyst (<a href=\"https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/\">https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/</a> [accessed on 3 March 2023]).</p><h2>3. Results</h2><h3>3.1 Lung wet/dry weight ratio</h3><p>The results of lung coefficients showed that the lung coefficients of mice in the LPS group were significantly higher than those in the NS group (<em>P</em> &lt;0.001, <a href=\"#pone-0287331-g001\">Fig 1</a>). Compared with the LPS group, the lung index of the OS and DXM groups showed a decreasing trend (<em>P</em>&lt;0.01), while the lung index of the OS and DXM groups also showed an increase compared with the NS group <em>(P</em> &lt;0.05). It was concluded that <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> mycelia could reduce the lung coefficients in mice, and its effect was comparable to that of DXM.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>LPS group vs. NS group, **** <em>P</em> &lt;0.001; LPS group vs. OS group, * <em>P</em> &lt;0.01, LPS group vs. DXM group, * <em>P</em> &lt;0.01; NS group vs. OS group, <sup>###</sup> <em>P</em> &lt;0.05, NS group vs. DXM group, <sup>###</sup> <em>P</em> &lt;0.05.</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287331.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287331.g001</a></p><h3>3.2 H&amp;E stain</h3><p>The H&amp;E staining results showed that the lung tissue structure of the NS group mice was clear, with no inflammatory cell exudation in the alveolar cavity and no thickening of the alveolar septa. Compared with the NS group, the model group showed alveolar collapse and thickening of alveolar walls and was accompanied by alveolar edema and significant inflammatory cell infiltration. Compared with the LPS group, the OS group had fewer alveolar collapses, no thickening of alveolar walls, and no significant infiltration of inflammatory cells, and the corresponding efficacy was comparable to that of DXM (<a href=\"#pone-0287331-g002\">Fig 2</a>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287331.g002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287331.g002</a></p><h3>3.3 Transmission electron microscopy</h3><p>The transmission electron microscopy results were consistent with the HE staining results (<a href=\"#pone-0287331-g003\">Fig 3</a>). At the subcellular level, we focused on type II alveolar cells, which contain layered secretory granules containing phospholipids, proteins, and glycosaminoglycans. It has the function of synthesizing and secreting pulmonary surfactants, as well as maintaining the alveolar environment. In type II alveolar cells of the NS group, mitochondrial lamellar cristae were visible, mitochondrial matrix was stained normally, rough endoplasmic reticulum was flat and cystic, ribosome was attached to the surface, lamellar bodies were in normal shape, and microvilli were abundant on the cell surface. In the LPS group, the type II alveolar cells showed obvious edema, which was manifested as the expansion of the inner chamber of mitochondria, the fracture of the crista, and the obvious decrease of electron density, presenting a vacuolar shape. Simultaneously, the lamellar bodies became vacuolated, and microvilli atrophy decreased. The status of type II alveolar cells in the OS group and DXM group was similar to that in NS group, but the microvilli were atrophied and decreased. There was still slight edema in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum in the DXM group. The experimental results indicate that the mycelium of <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> mycelia has a significant preventive effect on LPS-induced inflammation.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec3.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec3.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>LB, platelet vesicles; M, mitochondria; and↑ endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287331.g003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287331.g003</a></p><h3>3.4 Serum metabolome</h3><h4>3.4.1 Total ion flow diagram for the LC-MS analysis of mouse serum.</h4><p>A typical base peak chromatogram (BPC) for each group of samples in positive and negative ion modes provided a visual representation of metabolite detection in the sample (<a href=\"#pone-0287331-g004\">Fig 4A</a>).

The ion intensity of the highest peak in the graph was 100%, and the separation between the spectral peaks in the graph was good. From the LC-MS spectrum, 1,153 metabolites were identified, including phytochemical compounds, compounds with biological roles, lipids, and others.

In total, 155 metabolites were down-regulated, including l-lysine, (r)-malate, succinate, l-methionine, l-tryptophan, adipate, 4-hydroxy-2-l-thyroxine, and gamma-linolenic acid, suggesting that the 304 metabolites are associated with LPS-induced lung injury in mice.

Discussion</h2><p>In this study, the preventive effects of <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> mycelia on ALI were elaborated in terms of lung coefficients, degree of lung histopathology, and electron microscopic scans. LC-MS was used to detect the changes in metabolites in mouse serum, analyze the differential metabolites and related metabolic pathways in mouse serum, and study the potential mechanism of action of <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> mycelia for the prevention of ALI. Coronaviruses invade by binding to ACE2, which is abundantly expressed in alveolar type II cells, leading to pathological changes in alveolar epithelial cells, immune hyperactivation, a storm of inflammatory factors, and ultimately, ALI/ARDS [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. ALI has become a major public health burden worldwide and is characterized by the increased levels of pro-inflammatory transmitters, inflammatory cell infiltration, and alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>]. Therefore, controlling abnormal inflammation will effectively improve prognosis [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>]. LPS is the main bioactive component of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria and has long been widely used to induce lung inflammation in mice with ALI owing to its small size, fast growth, and simple source [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>]. The H&amp;E staining results of mouse lung tissues showed that the lung tissues of mice in the NS group had normal structures and no obvious pathological changes, but the lung tissues of those in the LPS group showed obvious damage and inflammatory manifestations. A large number of inflammatory cells infiltrated the alveolar cavity, the structural integrity of alveoli was destroyed, and some alveoli collapsed, proving the success of the LPS-induced ALI model in mice.</p><p>The above symptoms were significantly reduced in mice in the OS and DXM groups, and the transmission electron microscopy results of lung tissues were consistent with the lung coefficients and H&amp;E staining results, proving that <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> mycelia could significantly reduce the histopathological changes in the lungs and exert protective effects against ALI. A total of 304 metabolites, which could be regarded as important substances for inducing ALI in mice, were obtained from the LPS and NS groups using multivariate statistical analysis. When LPS stimulates the lungs, the body overproduces reactive oxygen species (ROS), increases malondialdehyde (MDA) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content, and drives the oxidative stress response. The continuously high production of ROS overloads the antioxidant defense system in mice and damages DNA, lipids, and proteins [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>]. Large amounts of ROS overload the antioxidant defense system and damage the DNA, lipids, and proteins, thereby driving oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is a critical mechanism in the pathogenesis of ALI. When the production of ROS in the lungs is sustained in large amounts, the lung epithelial and endothelial barrier structures are disrupted, cell membrane permeability is significantly increased, pulmonary edema is exacerbated, and the extent of lung tissue damage is amplified [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>]. Therefore, these 304 substances may be related to LPS-induced ALI in mice.</p><p>By differential metabolite analysis between the LPS and OS groups, l-histidine, n-isovalerylglycine, indole-3-ethanol, dl-histidine, (hydroxyethyl)met hacrylate, n-acetylvaline, n(6)-[(indol-3-yl)acetyl]-l-lysine, rac-etomidate, cortisol, tetrahydrocortisone, apocynin, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid, dimethyl sulfoxide piperonyl sulfoxide, niaprazine, 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoylplasmenylcholine, gibberellin a24, hydrocortisone cypionate, butylparaben, 7- ketodeoxycholic acid, (-)-nabilone, a-12(13)-epode, and 29 other potential biomarkers were identified. The 10 metabolites with significantly reduced levels in the OS group were mainly amino acid metabolites, including l-histidine, n-isovalerylglycine, dl-histidine, n(6)-[(indol-3-yl)acetyl]-l-lysine, and n-acetylvaline. Among them, l-histidine is a basic amino acid with an imidazole nucleus in the molecule and is a semi-essential amino acid that is necessary for the growth and development of infants and children. It has anti-ulcer effects and is used in the treatment of aging-related diseases, metabolic syndrome, atopic dermatitis, ulcers, inflammatory bowel disease, eye diseases, and neurological disorders [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>]; it also accelerates erythropoiesis, leukopoiesis, and iron uptake in living organisms. Moreover, l-histidine is a precursor of histamine, myostatin, and other biological substances. It has been suggested that myostatin reduces the formation of MDA, ROS, and glutathione and maintains the activity of glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and SOD, thus alleviating oxidative stress [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>]. Research has also confirmed that myostatin can reduce lung injury caused by bleomycin, alleviate the degree of pulmonary edema, and slow pathological changes in the lungs [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>]. L-histidine levels were significantly lower in the OS group, suggesting that <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> mycelia may exert an inhibitory effect on the inflammatory response and oxidative activity by regulating the balance of amino acid-like metabolites. N-isovalerylglycine is an acylglycine that is usually a secondary metabolite of fatty acids and a by-product of the catabolism of the amino acid leucine. As an essential amino acid, leucine not only serves as a substrate for protein synthesis but also stimulates protein synthesis by activating intracellular signal transduction pathways and regulating mRNA translation. Leucine may play a role in repairing ulcerative colonic mucosa by participating in intestinal epithelial cell metabolism and regulating protein turnover [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>]. Indole-3-ethanol is an important substance involved in amino acid metabolism and is closely related to tryptophan metabolism [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>]. Studies have shown that tryptophan metabolites promote movement and metastasis of cancer cells. For example, in vitro studies have shown that the expression of tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase in glioblastoma or breast cancer cells promotes tumor cell migration and invasion and overexpression of the rate-limiting enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 in lung cancer cells enhances the motility of tumor cells, whereas knockdown reduces their motility [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>]. This implies that <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> mycelia may participate in the prevention of lung injury in mice by regulating amino acid homeostasis and modulating amino acid analogs.</p><p>Cortisol is a steroid hormone secreted by adrenocortical fasciculus cells and plays an important role in human substance metabolism and stress responses. Cortisol and tetrahydrocortisone, important components of the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway, not only exert their corresponding biological effects but also negatively regulate the synthesis and secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormones. Cortisol is important for the treatment of acute lung injury [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>]. Cortisol can inhibit the production of oxygen free radicals by normal human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) for a longer period of time by regulating the activation of NF-κB; cortisol also lessened the extent of lung injury by inhibiting the production of syndromic mediators and overactivation of PMN [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>]. The bile acid 7-ketodeoxycholic acid is a steroidal amphiphilic molecule produced by the catabolism of cholesterol. It regulates bile flow and lipid secretion, is essential for the absorption of dietary fats and vitamins, and regulates all key enzymes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acid receptor agonists have been suggested as a possible treatment for pulmonary inflammatory diseases [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref038\" class=\"ref-tip\">38</a>]. The bile acid receptor TGR5 inhibits pulmonary inflammation by inhibiting the activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway, while the bile acid receptor farnesol X receptor (FXR) also inhibits pulmonary pro-inflammatory cytokines promoted by lipopolysaccharide by inhibiting cytokine secretion, inhibiting inflammation [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>]. Apocynin can inhibit NADPH oxidase activation and increase superoxide dismutase by decreasing the level of total protein and TNF-α; thus, it has a significant protective effect on lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome in mouse models [<a href=\"#pone.0287331.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>], suggesting that the mycelia of <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> mitigates the inflammatory response and oxidative stress by regulating the levels of apocynin and other substances, which, in turn, have a protective effect on the lungs. These substances exert anti-inflammatory effects by regulating metabolic pathways, including steroid hormone biosynthesis, aldosterone-regulated sodium reabsorption, prostate cancer, cortisol synthesis and secretion, Cushing syndrome, pathways in cancer, beta-alanine metabolism, sulfur metabolism, central carbon metabolism in cancer, and protein digestion and absorption.</p><p>In this study, the discovery of potentially active components from <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> mycelia has important significance in preventing acute lung injury in mice, which will provide support for the clinical application of <em>O</em>. <em>sinensis</em> mycelia.

This category of factors is often considered a key predictor of turnover intentions and job satisfaction, and it is important that companies and management have a good understanding of the factors that contribute to job satisfaction and turnover intentions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors that influence employees’ job satisfaction and turnover intention and to examine the moderating role of employees’ job autonomy. This cross-sectional study aimed to quantitatively assess the influence of perceived career development opportunity, perceived pay for performance, and affective organisational commitment on job satisfaction and turnover intention, as well as the moderating effect of job autonomy. An online survey, which involved 532 young workforce in China, was conducted. All data were subjected to partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The obtained results demonstrated the direct influence of perceived career development, perceived pay for performance, and affective organisational commitment on turnover intention. These three constructs were also found to have indirect influence on turnover intention through job satisfaction. Meanwhile, the moderating effect of job autonomy on the hypothesised relationships was not statistically significant. This study presented significant theoretical contributions on turnover intention in relation to the unique attributes of young workforce. The obtained findings may also benefit managers in their efforts of understanding the turnover intention of the workforce and promoting empowerment practices.</p><p><strong>Citation: </strong>Chen X, Al Mamun A, Hussain WMHW, Jingzu G, Yang Q, Shami SSAA (2023) Envisaging the job satisfaction and turnover intention among the young workforce: Evidence from an emerging economy.

The higher the turnover intention, the higher the likelihood of quitting the job [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. Belete [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>] described turnover intention as the intention to leave the workplace. The management must have good understanding of the factors that contribute to turnover intention considering how a higher turnover rate would affect the organisational morale, reduce the sense of identity within the company [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>], and yield negative financial impact since the companies have to allocate resources for recruitment and training and experience brain drain and lower productivity [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>]. Therefore, how to reduce the turnover intention among the young workforce and improve employee job satisfaction is an area that most organizations need to consider.</p><p>Currently, the young millennial workforce has become the largest group in the labor market, and how to retain these young employees has been an ongoing issue and challenge for most organizations and managers [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. In the past, the older workforce possesses more traditional values, such as contributing to the country and supporting the family, but the younger workforce emphasises more worldly values and embraces self-development as the key purpose of working [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. However, compared to middle-aged and older employees with more work experience and years of experience, the younger workforce focuses more on a number of unique attributes that in turn can have a significant impact on their job satisfaction and turnover intention, such as room for personal growth and development [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>], pay level and task clarity [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>], job variety and job autonomy [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>]. Therefore, this study attempts to examine the mechanisms influencing young employees’ job satisfaction and turnover intention, as well as the moderating role of job autonomy, by looking at some unique attributes, such as personal career development opportunities.</p><p>In addition, under the impact of Covid-19 on the economy and labor market, China’s youth labor market is facing a serious social problem-high brain drain most young new employees will leave or jump jobs within 2–3 years, with most of them being fresh university graduates, which in turn brings some hidden problems such as social problems of jobless youth [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>]. Therefore, improving job satisfaction and reducing the turnover rate of young employees during their working life is an urgent issue that most Chinese companies and organizations need to address. Due to China’s unique family planning policy, most young employees are now as independent and capable as only children and are more focused on their own interests and development, which in turn leads to a stronger attachment to salary and development opportunities due to both financial and family pressures [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>]. Therefore, understanding the perception and importance of salary and career development opportunities among young Chinese employees can effectively help companies and organizations find the right solution to retain this fresh and capable young workforce.</p><p>Furthermore, young workers in the workplace usually focus on things that are related to their own interests, such as career development opportunities and salary [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. Young employees are ready to change jobs when the benefits and development space provided by the job do not meet their expectations and satisfy their needs [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>]. At the same time, the imbalance between job income and personal living expenses will also put more stress on them, which in turn will lead to higher intention of young employees to leave their jobs [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. In addition, affective commitment is based on the emotional bond that employees build with the organization through positive work experiences, and some young employees’ lack of work experience and skills, among other factors, may lead them to be reluctant to spend too much time building a strong emotional bond with the organization, which in turn leads to the idea of low cost of leaving and dissatisfaction with the job status quo [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. Therefore, this study wanted to explore the perceptions and the level of importance of career development opportunities, pay for performance, and affective organizational commitment for young workers, and then discuss in depth whether these factors have some impact on the turnover intention and job satisfaction of young workers.</p><p>From the theoretical viewpoints, this study provided better understanding on the relationships of PC and PP with TI of young employees. Secondly, this study provided valuable insights on the unique attributes of the young workforce in relation to TI. Meanwhile, from the practical viewpoints, the obtained findings of this study on factors that influence TI and promote higher work efficiency can substantially benefit companies and managers to attain improvement and success. Addressing significant factors that influence TI, instead of the actual turnover, provides valuable opportunities for the managers to implement potential remedial measures prior to the actual turnover.</p><h2>Literature review</h2><h3>Theoretical foundation</h3><p>The equity theory suggests that individuals are likely to compare their own inputs and corresponding outcomes with other individuals, resulting in the formation of their own perceptions of fairness [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>]. Examples of inputs include loyalty, commitment, experience, skills, and flexibility, while examples of outcomes include remuneration, development, benefits, reputation, enjoyment, and rewards [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. Individuals who experience unfairness at the workplace are more likely to be demotivated and eventually yield lower inputs or seek changes. On the other hand, objective evaluation of the work performance would ensure fairness and yield higher inputs; knowing that good performance is rewarded, employees would work harder to be rewarded [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>]. The application of the equity theory to explore turnover is deemed fitting, as TI serves as the resultant outcome of inequity [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. Creating a fair working environment is part of the management’s measures to reduce TI among the employees.</p><p>Meanwhile the job demands-resources (JD-R) Model was first introduced by Demerouti et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>] and gained high popularity among researchers. The JD-R model posits that any job can be described by two sets of variables: job demands and job resources [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]. In particular, job resources are defined by Demerouti et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>] as “those physical, social, or organizational aspects of the job that may serve any of the following functions: (a) facilitate achievement of work goals, (b) reduce job demands and their associated physiological and psychological costs, and (c) promote personal growth and development.” Hence, career development opportunities, pay for performance and affective organizational commitment can all be considered job resources, since job resources include any aspects of the job that can stimulate personal growth and development. Job resources can contribute to positive outcomes and also act as protective factors against negative outcomes, such as turnover intention [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. In other words, employees who have access to more job resources are less likely to exhibit turnover intention.</p><h3>Development of hypotheses</h3><h4>Perceived career development opportunity (PC).</h4><p>PC refer to the employees’ perceptions of the availability of work assignments and job opportunities that align with their career interests and goals within their current organization [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]. Training for career advancement and growth can create the sense of being valued and appreciated for employees [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. Employees’ JS can be enhanced through professional development opportunities and flexible working hours (with more scheduling options) [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>]. This finding is corroborated by the JD-R model, which suggests that employees who have access to job resources tend to be more engaged and satisfied at work [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. Meanwhile, Muleya et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>] have underscored the impact of career development opportunity, regarded as one key job resource, on employees’ attitudes in the workplace. It is reasonable to assume that when employees are provided with career development opportunities, they are more likely to exhibit positive work attitudes. Additionally, Barhate and Dirani [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>] posit that the younger generation of workers require immediate rewards in the form of promotions and career advancement opportunities for a job well done. According to the equity theory [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>], individuals may become demotivated and decrease their input, or seek change, if they perceive that their efforts are not being justly compensated. The advantages of career development and career planning within an organization include reducing employee turnover rates and increasing job satisfaction among employees [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>]. Huyghebaert et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>] have examined the relationship between perceived career opportunities and turnover intentions in the nursing context, and their findings suggest that perceived career opportunities can prevent employees from intending to leave their jobs. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that when younger employees believe that they are not being provided with adequate perceived career opportunities in their current workplace despite their hard work, they may feel a sense of injustice and consequently, become more likely to quit their jobs. In view of the above, the current study proposed the following hypotheses for testing:</p><h4>Perceived pay for performance (PP).</h4><p>Gerhart and Fang [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>] defined pay for performance as a compensation programme that offers pay according to the performance in terms of outputs (e.g., sales volume) or behavioural evaluation. The correlation between pay growth and performance may not necessarily align with the correlation between employees’ perceptions of performance-based pay and actual performance [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>], which could affect employee attitudes. Consistent with the equity theory [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>], employees’ perceptions of equity through the comparison of inputs and outputs affect their attitudes at the workplace. Ren et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>] stressed the importance of assessing the influence of PP on employees’ attitudes at the workplace and identified PP and pay-level satisfaction as significant determinants of attitudes at the workplace (e.g., JS). Meanwhile, Kollmann et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>] described the differences in JS between younger and older employees according to the monetary rewards, task contributions, and imbalances in the relationship between monetary rewards and task contributions. In a more recent study, Bae [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>] reported the significant and positive influence of perceived fairness of performance evaluation on pay satisfaction, organisational satisfaction, and JS.</p><p>Additionally, the JD-R model has posited that job resources (e.g. satisfying salary, appreciation and performance feedback) have motivational potential and may therefore lead to work engagement, which may result in positive organizational outcomes, including retention intentions [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. The motivational impact of fair performance appraisal may be attenuated if employees perceive the performance appraisal process as lacking in fairness, validity, and reliability [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>]. As employees highly value distributive justice on PP, they tend to view their job continuity to be more predictable, controllable, and secure, which reduce the formation of TI [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>]. Hazeen and Umarani [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>] have provided empirical evidence that employees’ perceived fairness of human resource practices, such as performance management and compensation, has a significant positive association with their intention to remain with the organization. In line with the equity theory, TI can be viewed as the resultant outcome of perceived inequity [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. Considering that, creating a fair working environment serves as a key strategy for the management to reduce TI among the employees. Based on the findings of prior studies, the following hypotheses were proposed for testing:</p><h4>Affective organisational commitment (AC).</h4><p>Meyer et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>] and Buitendach and De Witte [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>] described AC as how employees are emotionally attached to, identify with, and involved with the organisation. AC is an individual attitudinal response that develops over time in response to an individual’s employment experiences and beliefs about the work environment [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref038\" class=\"ref-tip\">38</a>], which in turn influences individuals’ work attitudes [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>]. Several studies have demonstrated that employees who exhibit affective commitment are intrinsically motivated, passionate about achieving organizational goals [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>]. Nauman et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>] have pointed out the social exchange process by which training enhances the AC of employees which ultimately boosts employee’s job satisfaction. Moreover, The impact of AC has been the focus of research in the field of organizational behaviour and has been proved to be intricately linked to both individual behaviour and organizational outcomes [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>]. Gara et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>] highlighted the significant and negative influence of AC on TI. Employees tend to develop emotional attachments with their organization when they experience positive interpersonal relationships with their colleagues and supervisors and perceive a congruence between their personal values and the organization’s values [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref045\" class=\"ref-tip\">45</a>], thus resulting in a decreased likelihood of turnover intentions among employees [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref046\" class=\"ref-tip\">46</a>]. Hence, it is rational to infer that employees who possess AC demonstrate a heightened sense of belonging and connection to the organization’s vision, coupled with a strong desire to remain with the organization. Such emotional attachment to the organization may also lead employees to subconsciously perceive their work as meaningful. Thus, the following hypotheses were tested in this study:</p><h4>Job satisfaction (JS).</h4><p>Purani and Sahadev [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref047\" class=\"ref-tip\">47</a>] described JS as one’s sense of fulfilment gained from policies at the workplace, which are related to human resources, compensation, supervision, task clarity, and career development. Lin et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref048\" class=\"ref-tip\">48</a>] have suggested that enhancing JS can yield multiple benefits for organizations, including decreased employee turnover and increased operational efficiencies, leading to cost savings. Bharadwaj et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref049\" class=\"ref-tip\">49</a>] have proposed compelling evidence to support the notion that job satisfaction serves as a crucial antecedent to employee retention. This finding is supported by the JD-R model which posits the motivational process that job resources could stimulate positive work outcomes such as retention intention through positive work-related state (e.g. work engagement) or satisfaction of basic needs [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref050\" class=\"ref-tip\">50</a>]. Additionally, some researchers have attempted to establish a relationship between JS and turnover intention. A potentially effective strategy for organizations to decrease employee turnover intention is to cultivate job satisfaction [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref051\" class=\"ref-tip\">51</a>]. Alam and Asim [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>] have reported the significant and negative influence of different dimensions of job satisfaction (e.g. satisfaction with supervision, compensation, and career development) on TI. It is rational to infer employees who report higher levels of JS are more inclined to stay in their current workplace. Thus, the current study tested the following hypothesis:</p><h4>Job autonomy (JA).</h4><p>Spector [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref052\" class=\"ref-tip\">52</a>] described JA as the extent to which employees can make their own decisions based on their judgment and preferences on how they execute the assigned tasks. Specifically, when employees have autonomy at work, they can complete tasks in a free manner according to their judgment and preferences. The job characteristics model [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref053\" class=\"ref-tip\">53</a>] proposed that core job characteristics including autonomy generate a sense of responsibility for outcomes, meaningfulness, and knowledge of results, which in turn elicits intrinsic work motivation and job satisfaction. Autonomous jobs are expected to encourage higher levels of job satisfaction than controlled jobs because JA makes employees feel self-determined and free from external controls or constraints [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref054\" class=\"ref-tip\">54</a>]. As a job resource, JA can contribute to positive work outcomes [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. Consistent with the studies above, Morgeson and Humphrey [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref055\" class=\"ref-tip\">55</a>] have pointed out that JA is an important contextual resource to positively influence employees’ attitudes and behaviours. Thus, the current study expects a boosting effect of job autonomy on job satisfaction.</p><p>Previous studies have mainly examined the moderating role of job resources on the relationship between job demands and work outcomes [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref056\" class=\"ref-tip\">56</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref059\" class=\"ref-tip\">59</a>]. Hakanen et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref060\" class=\"ref-tip\">60</a>] also suggested that resources like job autonomy could moderate the impact of job demands for the majority of jobs. Prior researches have endeavoured to elucidate the degree to which job resources, such as job autonomy, act as a buffer in the association between variables, namely the relationship between job demands and work outcomes. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that scant studies have explored the moderating effect of job resources in relationships between positive variables. Dominguez et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref061\" class=\"ref-tip\">61</a>] have identified a need for additional research on the moderating influence of job resources in the relationships among positive variables. In response to this call, Wan and Duffy [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>] have investigated the moderating effect of JA on the association between decent work and job satisfaction, discovering that JA can strengthen the positive link between these two variables. According to Dominguez et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref061\" class=\"ref-tip\">61</a>], promoting elements of intrinsic motivation can enhance the relationship between intrinsic motivational resources and positive work attitudes, including work engagement and job satisfaction. Therefore, it is rational to infer that JA, as an intrinsic motivational organizational resource, may boost the effects of other job resources such as PC, PP and AC on job satisfaction. Additionally, this boost effect may stem from the accumulation of job resources, as proposed by Hobfoll [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref062\" class=\"ref-tip\">62</a>], wherein workers who have greater autonomy experience a stronger motivational effect from job resources compared to those with lower autonomy levels. In high-autonomy jobs, young individuals who have greater decision-making power and place a premium on career development and performance-based pay are given greater freedom to demonstrate their abilities and receive corresponding incentives. This, in turn, leads to increased job satisfaction. Moreover, employees who have high levels of JA feel a stronger sense of connection to their organization when they are allowed to perform their duties in a way that aligns with their personal values and goals. This sense of connection may ultimately result in higher job satisfaction. Thus, the current study proposed the following hypotheses for testing:</p><p><a href=\"#pone-0287284-g001\">Fig 1</a> presents the conceptual framework of this study.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287284.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287284.g001</a></p><h2>Methodology</h2><h3>Data collection</h3><p>The young workforce in China generally has lower organisational loyalty and is associated with higher turnover rate [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref063\" class=\"ref-tip\">63</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref064\" class=\"ref-tip\">64</a>]. Therefore, it was deemed significant for the current study to assess the influence of PC, PP, and AC on JS and TI, as well as the moderating effect of JA among the young employees in China. Referring to the China State Council [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref065\" class=\"ref-tip\">65</a>], youths are of those between 14 and 35 years old. Considering the context of the current study, working individuals of between 18 and 35 years old in China were targeted.</p><p>This research employed a quantitative approach to examine the relationship between variables. G*Power 3.1 was used to calculate the minimum sample size required to achieve the target analysis level and the desired minimum sample size with a power of 0.95 and an effect size of 0.15, taking into account the five predictors in this study. The output result indicates that at least 138 valid samples are required [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref066\" class=\"ref-tip\">66</a>]. However, for partial least squares-structural equation modeling analysis, it is recommended to use a minimum of 200 samples [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref067\" class=\"ref-tip\">67</a>]. Online data collection was conducted between July 1, 2022 and August 8, 2022. The online survey was administered through WJX (<a href=\"http://www.wjx.cn/\">http://www.wjx.cn/</a>), a functional and user-friendly tool. In order to ensure that all participants were young Chinese adults who were employed and aligned with the background of this study, judgmental questions were used for exclusion purposes. Prior to the commencement of the formal questionnaire, all participants agreed to sign a written informed consent form, in which they were informed of the purpose of the data collection, the final destination of the data, and their right to withdraw from participation at any time. The local ethics committee (Ethical Review of Biomedical Research Involving Human Beings) ruled that no formal ethics approval was required because the data is anonymous, not sensitive or confidential in nature and no vulnerable or dependent groups included. At the end of the data collection, this study successfully obtained 532 valid questionnaire sets.</p><h3>Measures</h3><p>The measurement items were adopted from prior related studies. The English version of these measurement items is presented in the <em>Supplementary Material 1</em>: <em>Survey Instrument</em>. The final scale was developed in English, which was later translated into Chinese. Two experts were appointed to evaluate the final version of the developed scale to ensure the accuracy and validity of these items and the equivalence of measures in both languages. Respondents were required to provide their responses according to a five-point Likert scale, with the endpoints of “strongly disagree” (1) and “strongly agree” (5).</p><h3>Common Method Variance (CMV)</h3><p>Harman’s single factor test was employed as an indicative procedure in this study to examine any potential CMV issues [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref068\" class=\"ref-tip\">68</a>]. The single factor accounted for 32.75% (&lt; 50%), which indicated the insignificance of the CMV issues. This study also performed the full collinearity test [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref069\" class=\"ref-tip\">69</a>] to evaluate CMV. Accordingly, the obtained values of variance inflation factor (VIF) for the input variables must be lower than the threshold value of 3.3 to establish the absence of the multicollinearity issue in the data. Based on the obtained results, the VIF values for PC (1.240), PP (1.221), AC (1.301), JS (1.221), JA (1.190), and TI (1.988) did not exceed 3.3, suggesting the absence of collinearity in this study’s data.</p><h3>Multivariate normality</h3><p>It is crucial to examine the multivariate normality of the data for the selection of appropriate data analysis method [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref070\" class=\"ref-tip\">70</a>]. Using the Web Power tool, this study obtained Mardia’s multivariate skewness and kurtosis and p-values for assessment. The recorded p-values did not exceed 0.05, suggesting the issue of multivariate non-normality in this study’s data.</p><h3>Data analysis</h3><p>PLS-SEM was performed in this study. PLS-SEM is a causal modelling approach that maximises the explained variance of the dependent latent constructs [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref071\" class=\"ref-tip\">71</a>]. Considering the presence of non-normality issues in this study, variance-based PLS-SEM estimation was considered. Prior to the assessment of the structural model, this study examined structural reliability, convergence validity, and discrimination validity. In particular, the reliability of the items was assessed based on Cronbach’s alpha, while the internal consistency reliability was determined based on Dijkstra-Hensele’s rho and composite reliability. Meanwhile, convergent validity was tested based on the values of average variance extracted (AVE). Besides that, discriminant validity was measured based on the Fornell-Larcker criterion, heterotrait-monotrait ratio (HTMT), and loadings and cross-loadings. Following that, the paths between constructs were estimated.</p><h2>Findings</h2><h3>Demographic profile of respondents</h3><p><a href=\"#pone-0287284-t001\">Table 1</a> presents the demographic profile of respondents in this study. In particular, 49.2% of the total respondents were male respondents, and the remaining 50.8% were female respondents. Most of the respondents were of 26 to 30 years of age (41.4%), followed by those in the age group of between 31 and 35 years (40.2%). Only 18.4% of the total respondents were of between 18 and 25 years old. Besides that, 51.7% of the total respondents reported working at the current workplace for six to 12 years. Other respondents reported working at the current workplace for less than two years (22.2%) and for two to five years (20.5%). Only 5.6% of the total respondents worked at the current workplace for 13 to 17 years. Most of the respondents had less than 10 days of annual paid leave (63.3%). Other respondents revealed to have more than 30 days of annual paid leave (6.6%). As for their monthly income, 43.0% of the total respondents reported earning between CNY 5,000 and CNY 8,000, followed by those who earned between CNY 8,000 and CNY 11,001 (37.2%), between CNY 11,001 and CNY 14,000 (7.7%), less than CNY 5,000 (7.7%), and lastly, more than CNY 14,000 (4.3%).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287284.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287284.t001</a></p><h3>Reliability and validity</h3><p>It is important to first evaluate the reliability and validity of the developed instrument prior to the assessment of the measurement model [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref067\" class=\"ref-tip\">67</a>]. Hair et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref072\" class=\"ref-tip\">72</a>] recommended the use of Cronbach’s alpha, composite reliability, and Dijkstra-Hensele’s rho for the evaluation of internal consistency reliability. The results in <a href=\"#pone-0287284-t002\">Table 2</a> revealed that all values of Cronbach’s alpha, composite reliability, and Dijkstra-Hensele’s rho exceeded the recommended threshold value of 0.7, confirming the internal consistency reliability of the instrument. Besides that, this study measured both convergent validity and discriminant validity. In particular, convergent validity implies that a set of indicators reflects the same construct, which can be determined based on the values of average variance extraction [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref067\" class=\"ref-tip\">67</a>]. The obtained results revealed that all values of AVE exceeded the threshold value of 0.5, suggesting adequate convergent validity. The results further revealed that all VIF values of constructs did not exceed 3.3, confirming the absence of multicollinearity issues [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref069\" class=\"ref-tip\">69</a>].</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287284.t002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287284.t002</a></p><p>As for the measurement of discriminant validity, this study referred to the HTMT ratio, Fornell-Larcker criterion, and cross-loadings. Referring to <a href=\"#pone-0287284-t003\">Table 3</a>, all HTMT values did not exceed 0.9, suggesting the discriminant validity of the study’s data. The recorded values of Fornell-Larcker criterion revealed that the square root value of AVE for each latent variable (the diagonal values) exceeded the square root of other variables [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref073\" class=\"ref-tip\">73</a>]. The results demonstrated adequate discriminant validity.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287284.t003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287284.t003</a></p><p>Meanwhile, the results in <a href=\"#pone-0287284-t004\">Table 4</a> revealed loadings of higher than 0.5, which exceeded the cross-loadings.

Accordingly, the values of <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> range from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating higher explanatory power. Referring to <a href=\"#pone-0287284-t005\">Table 5</a>, JS recorded <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> of 0.105, indicating that PC, PP, and AC explained 10.5% of the total variation in JS. On the other hand, TI recorded <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> of 0.466, indicating that PC, PP, AC, and JS explained 46.6% of the total variation in TI. Meanwhile, PC (<em>f</em> <sup>2</sup> of 0.113), PP (<em>f</em> <sup>2</sup> of 0.102), JS (<em>f</em> <sup>2</sup> of 0.112), and AC (<em>f</em> <sup>2</sup> of 0.151) exhibited small to medium effects on TI.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287284.t005\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287284.t005</a></p><p>Referring to the results tabulated in <a href=\"#pone-0287284-t005\">Table 5</a> and <a href=\"#pone-0287284-g002\">Fig 2</a>, this study demonstrated the significant and positive influence of PC (H<sub>1</sub>: <em>β</em> = 0.085, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.05), PP (H<sub>3</sub>: <em>β</em> = 0.161, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.05), and AC (H<sub>5</sub>: <em>β</em> = 0.128, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.05) on JS. This study also demonstrated the significant and negative influence of PC (H<sub>2</sub>: <em>β</em> = -0.259, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.05), PP (H<sub>4</sub>: <em>β</em> = -0.245, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.05), AC (H<sub>6</sub>: <em>β</em> = -303, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.05), and JS (H<sub>7</sub>: <em>β</em> = -0.257, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.05) on TI. This study found no zero between the 5% CI and 95% CI for all proposed relationships, confirming the support of these hypotheses.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287284.g002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287284.g002</a></p><p>However, the moderating effect of JA was found statistically insignificant at 0.05 level of significance, indicating that JA did not moderate the relationship between PC and JS in this study. Likewise, the results indicated that JA did not moderate the influence of PP and AC on JS. Thus, H<sub>8</sub>, H<sub>9</sub>, and H<sub>10</sub> were rejected.</p><h3>Importance-performance map analysis</h3><p>When it comes to PLS-SEM, the importance-performance map analysis (IPMA) presents valuable insights on the influence of antecedent constructs and their relevance for managerial actions [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref074\" class=\"ref-tip\">74</a>]. Through this map analysis, significant input constructs, which basically exhibit strong overall effects but with low average latent variable scores, can be identified. The most effective managerial actions can be determined by focusing on low-performing but important constructs. Referring to <a href=\"#pone-0287284-g003\">Fig 3</a>, the results of the overall effects (importance) and average latent variable scores (performance) clearly revealed AC as the most important construct in relation to TI, followed by PP, PC, JS, and lastly, JA. Despite the insignificant difference in the performance of all these constructs, AC recorded the lowest performance. In other words, the performance of the aspects related to AC should be prioritised due to its highest importance and lowest performance.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287284.g003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287284.g003</a></p><h2>Discussion and implications</h2><p>This cross-sectional study exclusively focused on turnover intention of young employees in China. Retaining young employees is undoubtedly a major challenge for organisations today. Therefore, it is crucial for organisations to understand how attached their employees are to the workplace. Focusing on that, the current study presented empirical evidence on factors that influence TI. Firstly, this study empirically proved the direct significant influence of perceived career development opportunities on job satisfaction (H<sub>1</sub>) and turnover intention (H<sub>2</sub>). Stahl et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref075\" class=\"ref-tip\">75</a>] and Ohunakin et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref076\" class=\"ref-tip\">76</a>] presented similar findings on the substantial influence of perceived career development opportunities on turnover intention. Likewise, Price and Reichert [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>] identified perceived career development opportunities as one of the factors that can enhance job satisfaction. In other words, PC significantly influences JS and TI. This study also empirically demonstrated the significant and positive influence of perceived pay for performance on job satisfaction (H<sub>3</sub>). This finding was consistent with the studies conducted by Ren et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>] and Bae [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>], which have reported the significant and positive relationship between perceived pay for performance and job satisfaction. This finding highlighted the importance of perceived pay for performance in motivating young Chinese employees and improving job satisfaction. Additionally, the study discovered that perceived pay for performance had a negative impact on turnover intention, providing support for H<sub>4</sub>. This finding aligned with the assertions by Kuvaas et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref077\" class=\"ref-tip\">77</a>] and Hur and Ha [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>]. They pointed out performance-based pay had a negative impact on turnover intention. In other words, among young Chinese employees, the recognition and appropriate compensation of their efforts and contributions may lead to a decreased likelihood of contemplating job departure.</p><p>Besides that, this study empirically demonstrated the positive influence of affective organizational commitment on job satisfaction. Thus, H<sub>5</sub> was supported. This finding was consistent with several prior studies [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref078\" class=\"ref-tip\">78</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref079\" class=\"ref-tip\">79</a>]. In other words, employees who have a strong emotional attachment to their organization are more likely to experience job satisfaction. Furthermore, the current study shed light on the relationship between affective organizational commitment and turnover intention in the context of young Chinese workers. Specifically, the study revealed that employees’ affective organizational commitment negatively influenced their turnover intentions (H<sub>6</sub>). Gara et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>] and Ampofo and Karatepe [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>] presented similar findings on the substantial influence of affective organizational commitment on turnover intention. The current study adds to the existing literature on the importance of job resources such as affective organizational commitment in reducing employee turnover intention, which has implications for organizations seeking to improve their retention rate. The obtained results of this study also confirmed job satisfaction as a significant determinant of turnover intention (H<sub>7</sub>), which supported the findings of several prior studies [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>]. In other words, the significance of job satisfaction as a predictor of turnover intention should not be overlooked.</p><p>Dominguez et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref061\" class=\"ref-tip\">61</a>] have highlighted the necessity for additional research on the moderating impact of job resources in the relationships between positive variables. While previous studies have primarily concentrated on the buffering effects of job resources on job demands, little attention has been given to the moderating role of job resources. Consequently, there is an urgent need for more extensive research to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this complex interplay. Responding to this call, this study empirically proved the insignificant moderating effect of job autonomy on the relationships of perceived career development opportunities (H<sub>8</sub>), perceived pay for performance (H<sub>9</sub>), and affective organizational commitment (H<sub>10</sub>) with job satisfaction. Tang and Vandenberghe [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref080\" class=\"ref-tip\">80</a>] found that affective organizational commitment may make employees feel driven by task autonomy, which can lead to job burnout, dissatisfaction, and intention to leave, and that employee job autonomy did not have a significant effect in this process; this is the same as the results of this study, where employee job autonomy did not moderate the effect between affective organizational commitment and employee job satisfaction. Wang et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>] confirmed that employees’ job satisfaction moderates the relationship between employees’ job autonomy and turnover intention, and found a significant relationship between employees’ salary factors (such as performance pay) and job satisfaction and it was not moderated by employees’ job autonomy; this is consistent with the results of H<sub>9</sub>.</p><p>In other words, young employees take into account the importance of job autonomy at the workplace, but different levels of job autonomy do not affect the influence of these factors on job satisfaction. This finding contrasted with previous studies, such as Iplik [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref081\" class=\"ref-tip\">81</a>], which showed that job autonomy moderates the relationship between employees’ perceptions and job satisfaction. Similarly, Wan and Duffy [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>] found that job autonomy moderated the relationship between job resources, such as decent work, and job satisfaction. It is possible that different demographic groups could yield different results, and cultural or contextual differences may explain the current findings. Cultural differences can influence how individuals perceive and respond to job resources, such as job autonomy, which could affect the moderating role of job autonomy in the relationship between other job resources and job satisfaction. In contrast to countries that prioritize individualism, Chinese culture emphasizes group harmony and collectivism, which could lead to greater acceptance of limited job autonomy and a focus on fulfilling assigned responsibilities [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref082\" class=\"ref-tip\">82</a>]. Therefore, future research is encouraged to explore the moderating effect of job autonomy between positive variables in diverse contexts.</p><h3>Theoretical implications</h3><p>This paper supports the call for research into the impact of employees’ interpretations of HRM practices on the effectiveness of the HRM system [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>,<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref083\" class=\"ref-tip\">83</a>]. This study presented significant theoretical implications that would be of much interest for future research on turnover intention, particularly among young employees. This study addressed the call of prior studies [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref084\" class=\"ref-tip\">84</a>] on the need for more in-depth insights on how job characteristics influence the formation of work attitudes among employees. This study presented empirical evidence on factors that can reduce young employees’ turnover intention in relation to the unique attributes of this young workforce. In particular, the significance of perceived career development opportunities, perceived pay for performance and affective organizational commitment in influencing turnover intention was highlighted. This study demonstrated the importance of considering the work characteristics of young employees when it comes to exploring the formation of their job satisfaction and turnover intention. This study also presented unexpected findings on how job autonomy does not moderate the relationships of perceived career development opportunities, perceived pay for performance and affective organizational commitment with job satisfaction despite the importance of job autonomy for young employees at the workplace.</p><h3>Practical implications</h3><p>The results of this study hold significant practical implications for organizations, particularly those operating in China, seeking to reduce turnover intention among young employees. To attain this objective, organizations must concentrate on augmenting perceived career development opportunities, perceived pay for performance, and affective organizational commitment. To improve employee perceptions of career development opportunities, organizations can facilitate training and development programs designed to enhance employees’ skills and competencies, provide opportunities for job rotation, and mentorship programs. Furthermore, managers can implement performance-based pay systems, furnish regular feedback and recognition to employees, and cultivate a culture of accountability and transparency. Such measures will elevate employees’ perception of fairness in the pay structure and stimulate their motivation to perform well.</p><p>This study also demonstrated affective organizational commitment as the most important element with the highest overall effects on turnover intention among young employees in China. However, it is the least-valued element by the management. Therefore, organizations should prioritize the development of strategies and initiatives that enhance employees’ affective commitment to the organization. Organizations can create a positive work environment that fosters trust, openness, and communication [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref085\" class=\"ref-tip\">85</a>]. This can be achieved by promoting a strong organizational culture, providing opportunities for employee involvement and participation in decision-making, and recognizing and rewarding employees’ contributions.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In summary, this study’s results demonstrate the importance of perceived career development opportunities, perceived pay for performance, and affective organizational commitment in determining employee job satisfaction and turnover intention among young Chinese workers. The positive impact of these factors on job satisfaction suggests that employees who perceive opportunities for career advancement and fair rewards for their performance are more likely to experience job satisfaction. Conversely, the negative effect on turnover intention highlights the critical role these factors play in young employee retention within the organization. The current study also discovers that while job autonomy may not directly moderate the relationships between job resources and job satisfaction, it is still an important factor to consider as it can impact employee motivation and engagement [<a href=\"#pone.0287284.ref054\" class=\"ref-tip\">54</a>]. Hence, this study provides important insights for organizations looking to improve employee retention and job satisfaction, and highlights the need for continued research in this area to further explore the complex relationships between these variables.</p><h3>Limitations and recommendations</h3><p>This study encountered several limitations. Firstly, the quantitative approach was adopted in this study, which provided limited understanding on this particular phenomenon. Therefore, it is recommended for future research to consider adopting mixed-methods approach to obtain more comprehensive understanding on this phenomenon. Secondly, as this study used a cross-sectional design, causal relationships among the study variables cannot be ascertained. Therefore, future studies should use longitudinal methods for data collection. Lastly, this study focused on examining the influence of PC, PP, and AC on JS and TI and did not explore the influence of other personal and situational factors. Therefore, it is recommended for future research to incorporate additional constructs into the study’s proposed model for testing or implement the same model in other countries for more generalised understanding.</p><h2>Supporting information</h2><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287284.s001\">S1 Data. </a></h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287284.s001\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287284.s001</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(CSV)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287284.s002\">S1 File. </a></h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287284.s002\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287284.s002</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(DOCX)</p><h2>References</h2><h3>Subject Areas <div id=\"subjInfo\">?</div>\\n    <div id=\"subjInfoText\">\\n      <p>For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/PLOS/plos-thesaurus/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link opens in new window\">here</a>.</p>\\n      <span class=\"inline-intro\">We want your feedback.</span> Do these Subject Areas make sense for this article?

One such recommendation advises limiting unhealthy snacks and replacing them with more fruits and vegetables with significant health benefits. This study investigates US consumers’ perceptions and preferences for healthy (vegetable-based) snacks/beverages. An online survey was designed to estimate consumer perception and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for vegetable-based crackers, spreads, and beverages. A sampling company sent the survey to its national consumer panels in 2020, resulting in a sample of 402 US consumers. Eligible participants were adults, primary grocery shoppers who consumed crackers, spreads, and beverages. Consumer WTP for healthy snacks/beverages, the dependent variable, was elicited using a payment card method. Independent variables include personality traits (Innovativeness and Extraversion) and the important factors affecting healthy snack purchases, health consciousness, and demographic variables. Results show that consumers’ preferences for healthy snacking vary by product, even when the products have similar health benefits. Significant positive associations exist between WTP for healthy snacks/beverages and personality traits, health consciousness, and some demographics. This study provides critical insights to policymakers and informs marketing campaigns to promote healthy snacking in the US more effectively.</p><p><strong>Citation: </strong>Okpiaifo GE, Dormoy-Smith B, Kassas B, Gao Z (2023) Perception and demand for healthy snacks/beverages among US consumers vary by product, health benefit, and color.

Snacks can be described as food or caloric beverages consumed outside regular mealtimes [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>]. Over 90% of adults in the United States reported consuming snacks at least once daily [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. While the frequency of snacking has increased over time, consumption of fruits and vegetables has decreased [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. This raises significant health concerns since most snacks tend to be high in carbohydrates while providing minimal amounts of other essential nutrients [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>]. High consumption of these unhealthy snacks (mainly salty snacks, desserts, candy, and sweetened beverages) would lead to an energy-dense and nutrient-poor diet [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. Nutrient-poor diet associated with the consumption of unhealthy snacks substantially raises energy intake, leading to an increased prevalence of overweight and obesity, along with accompanying health problems, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular diseases [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>]. Negative associations have also been identified between unhealthy snacking, oral hygiene, satiety/appetite, and metabolism [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>]. In addition, unhealthy snacking could impact the ability to maintain a balanced diet, contributing to poor eating habits and exacerbating weight gain [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. This is especially worse when unhealthy snacks are added to regular meal consumption without any compensation for the additional energy intake from these snacks. Therefore, there is a critical need to promote healthy snack options that would fulfill the snacking needs of individuals while providing a more nutrient-rich and calorie-balanced diet.</p><p>Healthy snacks can be described as snack choices that are more nutritionally balanced and intended to boost positive health outcomes. Examples of healthy snack choices are fruits, vegetables, and functional foods (consist of functional ingredients (which impart the health benefit) incorporated into a carrier/base food product, encompassing various food categories) that are modified to provide specific health benefits and reduce the risk of adverse health outcomes [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. A growing awareness of the role of diet in improving wellbeing and life expectancy has led to a rise in consumer interest in healthy food/snack choices [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. Despite the interest in healthy food/snack among consumers, most current research focuses on the consumption of unhealthy snacks. Research shows that the reasons for the prevalence of unhealthy snacks in diets vary by age group. Children and adults seem to base their choice of snacks on taste, thus biasing their choices towards unhealthy and indulgent snacks [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. For college students, the stress of schoolwork, lack of time, and lack of experience and skills required to prepare healthy meals/snacks are primary factors underlying the predisposition for unhealthy snacking [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>]. Unemployment and socioeconomic status are also factors that may push adults towards unhealthy snacking due to a need to buy cheaper food and/or cope with psychological stress [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>]. It is therefore important to identify novel healthy snacking options that will be perceived favorably by consumers and fit their needs. Thus, this study aims to investigate consumers’ preferences for multiple novel healthy snacking options.</p><p>There is a large body of work on consumer preferences for novel food technologies/products in general. In contrast to non-food domains, many technological innovations resulting in novel food products aren’t perceived as favorably by consumers [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>]. Given the importance of technological innovations to meeting global food demand, much research has been devoted to investigating the underlying factors driving these perceptions. Due to factors such as limited knowledge, consumers have been shown to utilize heuristics (e.g., emotions, trust, natural-is-better) in their evaluation of food products, which can result in biased decisions [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. The framing of food technology information can also influence consumers’ acceptance of new products [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. Additionally, food technology neophobia [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>], disgust sensitivity [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>], cultural differences [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>], and personality traits such as openness and conscientiousness [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>], may help explain some of the differences in consumer acceptance. Some other determinants revealed by various studies include food safety concerns [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>], risk perceptions [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>], socio-demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, education level) [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>], lifestyle habits (e.g., vegetarian, travelling habit) [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>]. Our study contributes to this literature by exploring preferences specifically for novel healthy snacking products.</p><p>As demand for healthy snacking choices continues to increase, more research is focusing on developing new products that can appeal to consumers. Recent work has examined consumer perceptions of novel functional products such as fortified farmed fish [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>], granola bars [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>], enriched coffee [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>], and probiotic yogurt [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>], among others. Also, given the high nutritional value of vegetables and the growing global demand for plant-based food products [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>], there is growing research into vegetable-based functional food product alternatives and general healthy snacking [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>]. Research shows that when consumers become more aware of their health benefits, they report a significant increase in the demand for these foods [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>]. For example, one study [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>] found that Turkish consumers had a favorable attitude towards functional food products, with a majority believing that these foods are necessary and part of a healthy diet. Other studies across various countries found similar results using outcomes such as willingness to try [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref038\" class=\"ref-tip\">38</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>], willingness to pay [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>], and willingness to buy/purchase intention [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref045\" class=\"ref-tip\">45</a>]. These studies spanned various food and beverage products such as apples, tomatoes, yogurts, cereals, etc.</p><p>This stream of literature has identified a wide range of factors that possibly influence preferences for these novel products. Demographic factors such as age [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>], gender [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>], education level [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref046\" class=\"ref-tip\">46</a>], and household size [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref046\" class=\"ref-tip\">46</a>], and marital status [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>] have been linked to willingness to consume various functional food products. The perceived healthiness of the product/ingredients [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref047\" class=\"ref-tip\">47</a>], health information [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>], knowledge of product brand [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref048\" class=\"ref-tip\">48</a>], price [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref049\" class=\"ref-tip\">49</a>], taste [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref045\" class=\"ref-tip\">45</a>], and other product characteristics have also been found to influence preferences. Multiple studies have also reported associations between various psychological/behavioral characteristics such as, health consciousness [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>], knowledge [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref050\" class=\"ref-tip\">50</a>], trust [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>], food neophobia [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>], motivations [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref051\" class=\"ref-tip\">51</a>], health-related behaviors [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref052\" class=\"ref-tip\">52</a>], beliefs [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref052\" class=\"ref-tip\">52</a>], and consumer preferences for novel food and beverage products.</p><p>Our study contributes to this growing literature and efforts to improve the nutrition quality of consumers’ diets by examining consumer preferences for healthy snacking options and the possible predictors of these preferences. Specifically, this study investigates US consumer preferences for multiple novel healthy (vegetable-based) snacks, including crackers and spreads. Since sugar-sweetened beverages are a major source of calories for people who enjoy snacking [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref053\" class=\"ref-tip\">53</a>], we also include vegetable-based beverages to examine how consumers’ preferences differ for healthy snack foods vs. beverages. This study also examines several factors that influence consumer willingness-to-pay (WTP) for healthy snacks and beverages, including Innovativeness, Extraversion, and other behavioral and socioeconomic/demographic factors.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to measure consumer WTP for multiple novel healthy snacks and beverage products that are differentiated by appearance and health benefits. The three focus product categories chosen for this study–crackers, spreads, and beverages–were selected because these are popular snacking options. This study provides valuable insights for food industries to develop more healthy snacks and beverages that appeal to consumers and inform marketing campaigns to promote healthy snacking. The results of this study can also benefit policymakers by providing information to guide dietary guidelines for healthy snacking recommendations.</p><h2>Methods</h2><h3>Data collection</h3><p>An online survey was conducted in 2020 using a nationally representative sample of 402 US consumers. Prior to the survey data collection, a focus group was conducted to collect feedback from participants that helped refine the survey instruments. The survey was also pretested multiple times to improve and finalize the questions. Eligible survey participants were at least 18 years old, primary grocery shoppers in the household, who consume crackers, spreads, and beverages other than water and milk. The survey duration was limited to 20 minutes to avoid respondent fatigue. The survey included attention check questions to improve data quality by filtering out respondents who did not pay attention to the questions [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref054\" class=\"ref-tip\">54</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref056\" class=\"ref-tip\">56</a>]. After providing consent and answering screening questions, respondents provided information relating to their snack and beverage consumption habits, attitudes towards health/environment, preferences for different healthy snack and beverage products, and behavioral and sociodemographic characteristics. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Florida (IRB 201901626), and participants provided written informed consent on the online questionnaire before answering the survey questions.</p><h3>WTP estimates</h3><p>Respondents reported their preferences for six product alternatives in each of the three snack categories (crackers, spreads, and beverages). The products from each snack category were plant-based and produced using a zero-waste process, which was clearly explained to the respondents using text and an illustrative diagram (<a href=\"#pone-0287232-g001\">Fig 1</a>). In this process, the vegetables are first pressed and fermented to produce the beverages. The vegetable byproducts from this step are then used to produce the crackers and spread, which would hold a similar taste profile and nutritional value to the beverages. The six products in each category were differentiated by color and health benefits (<a href=\"#pone-0287232-t001\">Table 1</a>). Preferences were elicited using a payment card contingent valuation method (CVM). Before the valuation sections, the respondents were presented with the products’ production process and health benefits, prices of related products in grocery stores, and a cheap talk script to control hypothetical bias. The respondents then proceeded to the payment card questions, where they provided their WTP for all six products in each product category (crackers, spreads, and beverages), totaling 18 WTP bids from each respondent.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287232.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287232.g001</a></p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287232.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287232.t001</a></p><p>CVM is a well-established method for eliciting stated preferences, which has gained traction in food marketing and behavioral economics [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref068\" class=\"ref-tip\">68</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref069\" class=\"ref-tip\">69</a>]. The payment card method is one of the CVMs in which respondents are presented with a series of prices (in ranges or point estimates) and asked to select the one that best reflects their maximum WTP. This method has been used to elicit WTP in several food studies [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref070\" class=\"ref-tip\">70</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref072\" class=\"ref-tip\">72</a>]. In this study, we first ask respondents to select from a series of presented price ranges and then (based on their choice from the price ranges) ask them to further select from a series of presented price point estimates. This way, we elicit both interval and point WTP estimates. Example questions are illustrated in the <a href=\"#pone.0287232.s001\">S1</a> and <a href=\"#pone.0287232.s002\">S2</a> Appendices.</p><h3>Measurement of personality traits and behavioral variables</h3><p>Psychology literature has established the importance of personality traits in humans, which, aside from demographics, capture the uniqueness of an individual. Personalities are usually expressed through thoughts, feelings, and actions. They are the foundation for numerous psychological and behavioral characteristics and have been extensively used to study various attitudes and behaviors in humans [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref073\" class=\"ref-tip\">73</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref074\" class=\"ref-tip\">74</a>]. Results from this stream of literature have linked personality traits to consumer decision-making and, more recently, consumer food-related choices [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref074\" class=\"ref-tip\">74</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref075\" class=\"ref-tip\">75</a>]. We thus explore the influence of two personality traits–Innovativeness and Extraversion–on consumer healthy snack and beverage preferences.</p><p>Innovativeness, a personality trait identified since the 1970s, describes an individual’s willingness/ability to adopt new ideas before others. More specifically, consumer innovativeness relates to the tendency of an individual to purchase new products relatively earlier than other consumers [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref076\" class=\"ref-tip\">76</a>]. Various scales have been used to measure consumer innovativeness, one of which is the Domain Specific Innovativeness Scale (DSI) developed by Goldsmith and Hofacker [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref077\" class=\"ref-tip\">77</a>]. The DSI scale measures Innovativeness within a specific product category and has been employed in several food and non-food product studies [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref078\" class=\"ref-tip\">78</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref081\" class=\"ref-tip\">81</a>]. Given the novelty of the focal products in this study, Innovativeness may influence respondents’ WTP. For this reason, we utilize the DSI scale to measure the degree of respondents’ Innovativeness regarding food. Respondents stated their agreement/disagreement for six statements (defined in <a href=\"#pone-0287232-t002\">Table 2</a>) on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly disagree, 7 = Strongly agree). Higher scores indicated a higher degree of Innovativeness.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287232.t002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287232.t002</a></p><p>The second personality trait we consider, Extraversion, relates to an individual’s tendency to be friendly, sociable, and energetic. Extraverted consumers tend to be impulsive buyers [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref082\" class=\"ref-tip\">82</a>], willing to purchase novel food products/try new aspects of food products [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref075\" class=\"ref-tip\">75</a>]. Also, since the food products used in this study are popular options at social gatherings, and extraverted individuals tend to be sociable, it is likely that their level of extraversion will be correlated with their consumption of these products. Based on these, the degree of Extraversion may influence respondents’ willingness to purchase the products. We use the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), developed based on psychologist Carl Jung’s theory of psychological type, to measure respondents’ Extraversion [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref083\" class=\"ref-tip\">83</a>]. The respondents stated their agreement/disagreement for the eight statements (defined in <a href=\"#pone-0287232-t002\">Table 2</a>) on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly disagree, 7 = Strongly agree). Higher scores indicated higher Extraversion.</p><p>Other behavioral variables explored in this study include product-related factors (e.g., price, health benefits, flavor, non-GMO, organic, etc.) that respondents consider essential when purchasing healthy snack products. Given the health benefits and zero-waste nature of the products in this study, the health and environmental consciousness of the respondents may influence their preferences. The respondents were asked to rate statements of how much they care about their health and the environment on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly disagree, 7 = Strongly agree). They also rated the degree of the healthfulness of their diets on a scale from 1 (Very unhealthy) to 7 (Very healthy). Sociodemographic characteristics such as age, race, gender, presence of kids, household income, and education were also collected.</p><h3>Regression models</h3><p>To determine the factors that influence WTP for each product, we estimated three Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR), one for each product category. Due to the potential interrelatedness of subjects’ preferences across the different alternatives in each product category, it is safe to assume that the error terms associated with the equations may be correlated. The SUR method is thus appropriate in this context since it allows for robustness of parameter covariance to error terms across the equations. Each regression has six linear equations, described below.\\n<a name=\"pone.0287232.e001\" id=\"pone.0287232.e001\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287232.e001\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(1)</span></span>\\nwhere <em>y</em><sub><em>ijk</em></sub> represents respondent <em>i</em>’s WTP for the <em>j</em>th product (<em>Red products</em>, <em>Orange products</em>, <em>Yellow products</em>, <em>Green products</em>, <em>Blue products</em>, <em>or Purple products</em>) in the <em>k</em>th category (<em>crackers</em>, <em>spread</em>, <em>or beverages</em>), <em>X</em><sub><em>ijk</em></sub> represents the vector of selected independent variables and <em>e</em><sub><em>ijk</em></sub> represents the unobserved variables. For each regression, the dependent variables were different based on the product differentiated by color and health benefits, while the independent variables were the same for all six equations. The selected independent variables include Innovativeness, Extraversion, important factors that influence the purchase of healthy drinks/snacks (Health benefits, Flavor, Non-GMO, Organic, Price), health consciousness (healthfulness of food consumed, care for health), and demographics. In the final model, environmental consciousness was not included because it was statistically insignificant in all regression models.</p><h2>Results</h2><h3>Summary statistics</h3><p><a href=\"#pone-0287232-t003\">Table 3</a> presents a summary of the sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics of the sample. Approximately 55% are females, and the majority (87.6%) are Caucasian/White. Around half the subjects are married (53.9%) and have a Bachelor’s degree or higher (54.7%). Subjects seem to be evenly distributed across the different age and income categories. Regarding the behavioral factors, average Innovativeness and Extraversion scores were 26.58 and 37.30, respectively. With maximum scores of 42 for Innovativeness and 56 for Extraversion, our results indicate a relatively high degree of Extraversion and Innovativeness among our sample. The average scores for health and environmental consciousness were 6.28 and 5.84, respectively, indicating a health and environmentally conscious sample.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287232.t003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287232.t003</a></p><h3>Consumption frequency/importance of health benefits</h3><p>We evaluated how frequently the respondents consume various food products and beverages (<a href=\"#pone-0287232-g002\">Fig 2</a>). The consumption frequencies for all food products are high, including snacks. Consumption frequency was relatively higher for water, tea/coffee, milk, soda, fruit juice, and lower for sport drinks, energy drinks, alternative milk, and vegetable drinks. We also asked the respondents to rate the importance of six health benefits that can be provided by snacks/beverages in this study when purchasing food products (<a href=\"#pone-0287232-g003\">Fig 3</a>). The graph shows that the heart protector and antioxidant health benefits are very important to the respondents, while the least important health benefits are Aphrodisiac and Breastfeeding.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p><em>Notes</em>: Frequency: 1 –Almost never. 2 –Several times a year, but not every month. 3 –Monthly. 4- Several times a month, but not every week. 5- Weekly. 6- Several times a week, but not every day. 7 –Daily. 8 –More than once per day.</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287232.g002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287232.g002</a></p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec2.fig2.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec2.fig2.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p><em>Notes</em>: Each bar represents the fraction of the respondents that selected the corresponding health benefit.</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287232.g003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287232.g003</a></p><h3>Important factors that influence the purchase of healthy snacks/beverages</h3><p><a href=\"#pone-0287232-g004\">Fig 4</a> presents the importance of factors that influence respondents’ purchase of healthy products (snacks/beverages). The respondents seem to have similar preferences for both snacks and beverages across most factors. Flavor is the most important factor that respondents consider when purchasing healthy snacks and beverages, followed by price. The least important factor seems to be organic.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec3.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec3.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p><em>Notes</em>: Y-axis represents mean ratings.

First, we found that the WTP for all alternatives in all three product categories are positive and significant. This shows that consumers do indeed have significant preferences for healthy snacks/beverages. Importantly, in all 3 product categories, pairwise tests (Wilcoxon signed rank tests) show that the WTP for the green (heart protector) and the purple (antioxidant) products are significantly higher (p&lt;0.09 for crackers, p&lt;0.01 for spreads, p&lt;0.05 for beverages) than the other four alternatives. This is an interesting result and seems to corroborate the earlier results showing that respondents place higher importance on heart protector and antioxidant health benefits than on the other health benefits. The average WTP for green products are $2.18, $3.16 and $3.43, respectively, for beverages, crackers, and spreads. For purple products, average WTP are $2.19, $3.11, and $3.28, respectively, for beverages, crackers, and spreads. Friedman test results indicate statistically significant differences in WTP between the products within each category (p&lt;0.000), thus confirming that consumer preferences for healthy snacks/beverages vary by health benefits.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec4.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec4.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p><em>Notes</em>: Friedman test was used to test for significant differences between products in each category (p&lt;0.000).</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287232.g005\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287232.g005</a></p><p>Results from the SUR model over beverage products are presented in <a href=\"#pone-0287232-t004\">Table 4</a>. We observe a significant positive influence of Innovativeness on WTP for orange (anti-aging) and purple (antioxidant) drinks, indicating that respondents who are more likely to try new things (i.e., have a higher innovativeness score) are willing to pay more for these drinks. Extraversion is also positively correlated with WTP for red (aphrodisiac), green (heart-protector), and yellow (breastfeeding) drinks, indicating that individuals who are more friendly/sociable hold higher WTP for these drinks. We also find that individuals who consider health benefits as a primary factor when purchasing healthy drinks are willing to pay more for all the beverage options except for red (aphrodisiac) and yellow (breastfeeding). In contrast, the perceived importance of price seems to drive a negative effect on WTP for the orange (anti-aging) beverage, implying that consumers who place high importance on price are willing to pay less for the orange beverage. The stronger the respondents’ impression of the healthfulness of their diet, the higher their WTP for all beverage options except the green (heart-protector) and orange (anti-aging) drinks. Looking at demographics in <a href=\"#pone-0287232-t004\">Table 4</a>, we see a significant negative correlation between age and WTP for all beverage products, indicating that younger individuals are willing to pay more for the healthy beverages. We also find evidence that African Americans have a higher WTP for the red (aphrodisiac) and yellow (breastfeeding) drinks, Asians have a lower WTP for the purple (antioxidant) drink, and those with kids have a higher WTP for the green (heart-protector) drink.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287232.t004\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287232.t004</a></p><p>Results from the SUR model over the crackers product alternatives are presented in <a href=\"#pone-0287232-t005\">Table 5</a>.

Extraversion is positively correlated with the WTP for the yellow (breastfeeding) spread only, indicating that individuals who are more friendly/sociable (i.e., have a higher extraversion score) are willing to pay more for this spread.

This study evaluated consumer preferences for healthy crackers, spreads, and drinks, which are differentiated by color and health benefits. Out of six health benefits presented in the different product alternatives, respondents seem most attracted to two–heart protector and antioxidant–and are willing to pay higher premiums for the products carrying these benefits. A possible explanation for this result is that respondents are more familiar with these health benefits and/or perceive them as more primary/important than the other health benefits presented. Since the products in this study are related to functional food products, the results can be discussed in the context of functional foods literature. Previous work on consumer acceptance of functional food shows that familiarity with the health benefits provided by functional foods will boost consumer acceptance [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref084\" class=\"ref-tip\">84</a>]. Although consumers have been shown to be more willing to purchase functional foods based on their health benefits [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref085\" class=\"ref-tip\">85</a>], our study shows that consumers also differentiate between different health benefits, preferring some over others. In line with our results, earlier studies of functional food found that purchase intention is higher when the product’s health claims are physiological (e.g., less risk of cardiovascular disease) rather than psychological [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref086\" class=\"ref-tip\">86</a>]. For instance, information about reduced cholesterol benefits increased consumers’ purchase intention for a fortified yogurt drink [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref087\" class=\"ref-tip\">87</a>]. In another study, information about antioxidant benefits increased consumers’ purchase intention for functional foods [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>].</p><p>Understanding factors underlying consumer preferences for healthy products will help marketers and policymakers to promote healthier snacking behavior. In our study, we highlight the relationship between various personality/sociodemographic/behavioral factors and consumer WTP for the healthy snack products. The influence of psychological characteristics on consumer decision-making for food products is an important topic that remains relatively underexplored, specifically in the area of preference for healthy snacking products. Some studies have examined the significance of psychological factors such as perceptions, beliefs, attitudes, trust and food neophobia [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref050\" class=\"ref-tip\">50</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref051\" class=\"ref-tip\">51</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref088\" class=\"ref-tip\">88</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref094\" class=\"ref-tip\">94</a>]. Our results show that Innovativeness is one factor that exhibits a strong relationship with WTP for multiple products across the three product categories, which is reasonable considering the novelty of the products used in the study. For example, purple is an unusual color for a drink, cracker, or spread, and \"anti-aging\" is not a popular health benefit marketed in food products. Our results conform with the literature showing that Innovativeness predicts willingness to try various new healthy food/drink products [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref095\" class=\"ref-tip\">95</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref096\" class=\"ref-tip\">96</a>]. Innovative consumers are a very important group because they are willing to try new products first and are usually the first to spread information about these products to others [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. Consumers are influenced by these innovative consumers when making decisions about purchasing new products [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref097\" class=\"ref-tip\">97</a>]. Given this background and our results, marketing campaigns for new healthy food products should first target innovative consumers.</p><p>Extraversion is also significantly correlated with WTP for some beverage and spread products. For example, extraverted individuals prefer red (aphrodisiac), green (heart-protector), and yellow (breastfeeding) beverages, showing that personality traits may also influence consumers’ differentiation of health benefits. This is consistent with previous research results, which showed that extroverted consumers are more willing to purchase novel aspects of food products [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref098\" class=\"ref-tip\">98</a>]. The confirmed positive correlations between Innovativeness/Extraversion and preferences for various products can be used by marketers to explore personality-based marketing. Research shows that this type of marketing strategy can be done using platforms such as social media and is effective [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref099\" class=\"ref-tip\">99</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref100\" class=\"ref-tip\">100</a>].</p><p>Consumers consider several factors (extrinsic and intrinsic product characteristics) as they decide to purchase healthy food products. We explored the influence of some of these factors on WTP for healthy snacks/beverages. Health benefit shows up as a strong predictor of WTP for most beverage products. This is in line with the literature showing consumers are attracted to healthy products based on their health benefits [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref085\" class=\"ref-tip\">85</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref101\" class=\"ref-tip\">101</a>]. This is especially beneficial to marketers if consumers are familiar with the health benefits [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref084\" class=\"ref-tip\">84</a>]. Thus, marketing campaigns could increase consumers’ awareness and knowledge of various health benefits of healthy snacks and use labels to display these attributes more clearly on the products. The respondents’ perceived importance of price seems to exert a small negative influence on only two of the beverage products (Orange, Anti-aging, and Blue, Athlete recovery), which could imply that these two benefits are not as important to the respondents’ beverage purchase. For the rest of the products, however, the respondents are not deterred by price. This conforms with Huang et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref049\" class=\"ref-tip\">49</a>] and Ares et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref101\" class=\"ref-tip\">101</a>], who argue that functional food consumers are usually more interested in the health benefits of the products than the price. Flavor strongly influences WTP for the red (aphrodisiac) crackers and spreads only. The strong positive impact of flavor is in line with previous sensory studies that identified flavor as a critical attribute contributing to consumer acceptance of functional food [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref102\" class=\"ref-tip\">102</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref103\" class=\"ref-tip\">103</a>]. The result that flavor was only correlated with the WTP for the red crackers and spread is interesting and could be explained by the fact that consumers placed the lowest importance on the health benefit of the red products (i.e., aphrodisiac). Respondents who place higher importance on organic have a higher WTP for the green (heart protector) crackers. This is a reasonable result given the importance of this health benefit to the respondents, and considering that individuals who prefer organic foods tend to be health conscious [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref104\" class=\"ref-tip\">104</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref105\" class=\"ref-tip\">105</a>]. The positive effect of consumers’ health consciousness, and attention to the healthiness of their diet, on acceptance of healthy food products, is well-established in the literature [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref045\" class=\"ref-tip\">45</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref049\" class=\"ref-tip\">49</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref106\" class=\"ref-tip\">106</a>]. These studies can explain the strong positive correlation between the respondents’ perception of the healthiness of their diets and their WTP for almost all products in the study.</p><p>Our results show a significant influence of various demographics on WTP for health snacks, confirming the conclusion of previous research on healthy food consumption. We find a negative correlation between age and WTP for all products used in our study. This is in line with some earlier studies that reported a higher interest in functional foods among younger individuals [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref107\" class=\"ref-tip\">107</a>]. However, it also contradicts the results of several past studies, where older individuals were found to have a higher WTP for healthy food products compared to younger individuals [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref050\" class=\"ref-tip\">50</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref108\" class=\"ref-tip\">108</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref111\" class=\"ref-tip\">111</a>]. One possible explanation is that older individuals are not convinced by/do not trust the health claims of the snacks, or they do not believe that snacks can be healthy. Previous studies found that in contrast to younger individuals, older individuals are more attracted to healthy food products when the health claims refer to a reduction of negative outcomes (e.g., reduction of risk for heart disease) rather than health benefits [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref112\" class=\"ref-tip\">112</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref113\" class=\"ref-tip\">113</a>]. Another possible reason could be due to the novelty of the products since younger individuals tend to be open-minded and willing to try novel foods [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref096\" class=\"ref-tip\">96</a>]. Race was also correlated with the WTP for some snack products, with the results showing differences, particularly in preferences among Caucasians and African Americans. This could guide marketing campaigns to target the specific needs of certain consumer groups. We do not find a significant correlation between gender and WTP for most of the products, which is contrary to previous findings of higher acceptance of healthy food products among females compared to males [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref050\" class=\"ref-tip\">50</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref111\" class=\"ref-tip\">111</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref114\" class=\"ref-tip\">114</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref115\" class=\"ref-tip\">115</a>]. Our result could be driven by females’ skepticism about the health claims of the novel products in this study. We also find a higher WTP for people with kids across some of the products, which can be explained by the fact that parents of young children tend to be nutrition conscious, and they tend to pay attention to the healthiness of the foods they purchase, to ensure that their kids are in good health [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref116\" class=\"ref-tip\">116</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref117\" class=\"ref-tip\">117</a>]. Lastly, household income strongly influences WTP for all spreads and most of the crackers. This is similar to other studies, which found that higher income consumers have higher purchase intentions for healthy food products [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref107\" class=\"ref-tip\">107</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref118\" class=\"ref-tip\">118</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref120\" class=\"ref-tip\">120</a>].</p><p>Previous functional foods studies found that consumers care not just about the ingredients but also about the functional food carrier/base product used [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref038\" class=\"ref-tip\">38</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref049\" class=\"ref-tip\">49</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref093\" class=\"ref-tip\">93</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref121\" class=\"ref-tip\">121</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref122\" class=\"ref-tip\">122</a>]. Some products are perceived by consumers to be intrinsically healthier/more credible and thus preferred [<a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref085\" class=\"ref-tip\">85</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287232.ref123\" class=\"ref-tip\">123</a>]. This can explain the key differences between our results for the beverages, crackers, and spreads. For example, Innovativeness seems to be an important characteristic in all three product categories, but most especially for the crackers, as it influences the WTP for all the cracker product alternatives besides the green (heart protector) crackers. On the other hand, it only affects WTP for two product alternatives from beverages and spreads. A possible reason for this is that the novelty of the crackers is more appealing to the respondents than the beverages/spreads. The exception of the green crackers may be because the respondents do not perceive green crackers’ characteristics (color/health benefit/ingredients) as novel as those of other alternatives. Another notable difference is that Extraversion has no effect on crackers, a small effect on one of the spreads, but a stronger effect on beverages. Also, the health benefits of the beverages seem to be more important to respondents than those of the snacks/spreads. A possible explanation is that the respondents perceive the beverages to be healthier carriers of the ingredients than the crackers and spreads. In contrast, for the crackers and spreads, flavor is the attribute considered more important. Another interesting difference is that respondents who tend to consume healthier food, in general, are willing to pay more for all the alternatives in all three product categories, except for the orange (anti-aging) and green (heart protector) beverages. One key finding is that household income was not significantly correlated with WTP for the beverages but positively correlated with WTP for crackers and spreads, which implies the differential effect of income on health snack consumption that are product dependent.</p><h2>Conclusion/implications for research and practice</h2><p>Our results show that US consumers have strong preferences for plant-based healthy snacking. Their preferences for healthy snacking vary by product category and the specific health benefit that can be provided by the products. In addition, several key personality, demographic, and attitudinal variables have significant effects on consumer WTP for healthy snacks. However, the effect of these variables also varies depending on the health benefits and the product category. Results uncovered in this study provide useful and critical information for the food industry/policymaker to produce/promote healthy food products that are more likely to succeed in the marketplace. Future research may estimate the relationship between healthy snack consumption and health outcomes. In addition, identifying the messages that can be used to educate consumers more effectively about healthy snacks is critical to developing effective education programs among different consumer groups to promote healthy food consumption.</p><p>Finally, despite the useful insights afforded in this study, it also has some limitations. First, consumer preferences were elicited using a stated preference approach, where the respondents reported their valuation in a hypothetical setting. This was necessary in this study since the products being investigated do not yet exist in the market. While we included a cheap talk script to improve the accuracy of the stated preferences, hypothetical bias is still possible (where respondents report higher valuations than they would be willing to pay in a real shopping scenario). Future studies could investigate this point further by comparing preferences for similar products in a hypothetical vs. incentive-compatible setting. Second, our sample size is relatively small for a nationwide survey. Although the current sample size ensures meaningful statistical power for all analyses conducted in this study, it may not support in-depth sub-analyses over different consumer groups that vary in socioeconomic or behavioral characteristics. Future research could investigate these sub-analyses to potentially uncover important insights that could help identify segments of the market.</p><h2>Supporting information</h2><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287232.s001\">S1 Appendix. </a>Example valuation question (point estimate).</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287232.s001\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287232.s001</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(TIF)</p><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287232.s002\">S2 Appendix. </a>Example valuation question (interval estimate).</h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287232.s002\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287232.s002</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(TIF)</p><h2>References</h2><h3>Subject Areas <div id=\"subjInfo\">?</div>\\n    <div id=\"subjInfoText\">\\n      <p>For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/PLOS/plos-thesaurus/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link opens in new window\">here</a>.</p>\\n      <span class=\"inline-intro\">We want your feedback.</span> Do these Subject Areas make sense for this article?

Though most associated with the illicit drug market [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>], dark web marketplaces (DWMs) provide an unregulated platform for the sale and purchase of any item (listings). Recent data report how two thirds of the available dark web listings, are represented by drug related items, including newly developed or previously unknown chemical and pharmaceutical, such as novel psychoactive substances [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. Next to these, listings as falsified documents, malware, fraud products, weapons, protected wildlife and human organs can be found, often from the same vendor portfolio [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>]. DWMs are highly volatile and dynamic in nature: new products are added or removed to crime portfolio according to market demand, with criminal businesses becoming active in pursuit of newly emerging profit opportunities [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>]. To ensure anonymity of both sellers and vendors and non-traceability of payments, transactions are made with cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoins or Monero, facilitated by automatic encryption via the usage of Pretty Good Privacy cryptography [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>]. This very volatile nature was confirmed during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the disruption, spread of misinformation and confusion caused, were quickly capitalised upon by criminal groups looking to expand their business portfolio with the sale of counterfeit antiviral medications, COVID-19 vaccines, and other medical products [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. The surge in demand for vaccines and certifications as part of various government measures to facilitate freedom of movement and access to services for individuals [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>] in combination with the shortages of supply observed for these products in various geographical areas [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>], made their e-commerce even more appealing [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. In addition, the demand for cures saw an increase due to the infodemic and misinformation about the risks and the number of COVID-19 cases happening during the pandemic [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. The purpose of this study was to assess availability of illicit COVID-19 vaccines and related goods on DWMs at the start of the pandemic.</p><h2>Methods</h2><h3>Study design and data sources</h3><p>Digital trace data was collected from prominent darknet marketplaces, using a secured platform provided by the cybersecurity company CyberSolace, a private sector company specialising in information security advisory services. The platform is primarily used for threat intelligence and provides monitoring of the DWMs by performing rapid and reproducible searches for different marketplaces, vendors, and items. The ‘search spiders’ developed using Python scripts allow a rapid scanning of the darknet as well as a retrospective analysis of the marketplaces which no longer exist due to law enforcement operation or exit scams. This is an advantage compared to Tor or other traditional browsers which are unable to detect activities of markets that are no longer available. Searches were conducted in October 2021 and covered the period from March 2020 to October 2021. This timeframe was chosen as inclusive of the start of COVID-19 pandemic and the introduction of restrictions worldwide. The keywords used were identified in relation to a) COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., Coronavirus; COVID; COVID19; COVID-19; Corona; Rona); b) product types (Pass, Vaccine, Vaccination, Card, Cure, Certificate, Medicine); specific vaccine brand names (e.g., Moderna); and other related keywords (e.g., ventilator) and colloquialisms (e.g., covaxin). Duplicates, either on the same thread or from previously observed threads, were removed from the final hits. The data collected for each related search term were classified according to a) listing title b) product type c) description of items sold d) asking price e) marketplace f) vendor g) Bitcoin wallet details h) vendor name and contact methods i) listed date and j) any additional description about the vendor available. For the scope of the paper private details on the vendors have been removed. Results were manually filtered and then validated through searches on darknet dedicated online sources to verify the information relating to specific marketplaces. Further information on classification methods is available on <a href=\"#pone-0287231-t001\">Table 1</a>. No participant’s consent was needed for this study, because information was freely available on the darkweb.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec2.sec1.table-wrap1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec2.sec1.table-wrap1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p> QR stands for Quick Results.</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287231.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287231.t001</a></p><h3>Data analysis</h3><p>Results were analysed using both qualitative (e.g., posts time frame, vendors reported geographical area, price, and vendor’s profile) and quantitative methodologies. The possible correlates between the sale of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 related items were also considered using a descriptive-correlational design. The structure of the products was first described in frequencies (%) according to the product types, with Spearman correlation coefficients (r) subsequently calculated.</p><h3>Ethics</h3><p>This study was approved by the Human Sciences Ethics Committee at the University of Hertfordshire, protocol number: aLMS/SF/UH/02951(2) as well as by the funding partner’s Ethics committee.</p><h2>Results</h2><h3>Qualitative analysis</h3><p>A total of 42 listings for COVID-19 related products were identified across the 118 DWMs. These were sold across eight marketplaces by 25 vendors as presented in <a href=\"#pone-0287231-t002\">Table 2</a>.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287231.t002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287231.t002</a></p><p>The same listings (item description, date of posting, prices) were found on multiple DWMs by the same seller, presumably with the aim of reaching different geographic locations. These listings were considered as duplicates and removed. Some of the products identified differed only in quantity and/or price, hence these were grouped together within a single entry. No bitcoin wallet information was retrieved due to the nature of the platform used. In terms of product categories (<a href=\"#pone-0287231-t001\">Table 1</a>), there were 20 “cure”, 13 “certificate”, 3 “test”, 2 “vaccine”, 1 “medical supply” and 1 unassigned. The “cure” entries were represented mostly by IVERMECTIN/IVERHEAL tablets in two different dosages (6 and 12 mg), followed by hydroxychloroquine sulphate tablets (200 mg) and amantadine tablets (Amantrel, 100 mg). A “weed calm package” was also advertised as a cure for COVID-19. The “certificate” category included a variety of products from simple/blank official certificate cards to legitimate vaccination registrations including a functional QR code. These were found to be region restricted (e.g., USA, Netherlands). Only two hits were retrieved for vaccines; Moderna was identified as the manufacturer through the item’s description. Among the hits retrieved for “tests” were COVID-19 tests by La Roche. Where available, the description for each item identified on the dark web is reported in Supplementary Material.</p><p>The prices identified across these 40 entries (<a href=\"#pone-0287231-t002\">Table 2</a>) varied from €1 to US$3029. Within the “cure” category, prices were relatively consistent and increased according to dosage (e.g., 6 and 12 mg) and quantity (e.g., 50, 100, 200), with the highest price (US$199) observed for 450 amantadine tablets and 500 IVERHEAL 12 mg pills. Prices associated with the “certificate” product type varied significantly from US$55 for blank vaccine cards to €1500 –US$3200 for official, QR-coded European or USA cards. “Tests” advertised on the dark web had an average price of US$45, which decreased for bulk purchases. The only two hits obtained for vaccines were found to be priced at US$ 200 a shot, independent of the quantity purchased. The COVID-19 related products were advertised in specific time frames that followed the pandemic timeline (<a href=\"#pone-0287231-g001\">Fig 1</a>) The majority of hits retrieved were advertised on the dark web in 2021. All the “certification” hits were advertised starting from June 2021 to October 2021, while dates associated with the “cure” results spanned a broader time space from April 2021 to July 2021. Only one “cure” was advertised earlier (October 2020). Self-tests for COVID-19 were advertised in 2020 only (July and November), while each of the two vaccines were advertised in July 2020 and April 2021.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287231.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287231.g001</a></p><p>The COVID-19 related products identified (<a href=\"#pone-0287231-t002\">Table 2</a>) were mostly advertised for sale across specific countries or continents. This was particularly true for “certificate” products, which differed according to geolocation and were country specific. These were mostly for sale in the USA and Europe (Netherlands and France). By contrast, “cure” and “vaccine” products had a wider market presence and were mostly for sale worldwide, originating mainly from India, Singapore, Switzerland and the USA.</p><p>The eight DWMs selling COVID-19 related products were Cartel, Cannazon, Dark0de Reborn, Versus, WhiteHouseMarket, Yakuza, Europa and DarkMarket. At the time of the search all were active, except Europa and DarkMarket. The analysis of the content of inactive markets was possible, as mentioned in the method section thanks to the nature of the scraping platform. The number and size of the markets varied from 595 items and 119 vendors (Dark0de Reborn) to ~70,000 items and 2,000 vendors (DarkMarket) (<a href=\"#pone-0287231-t003\">Table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287231.t003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287231.t003</a></p><p>The size of the 25 sellers’ portfolios varied conspicuously as well. The biggest seller (Vendor 22) displayed a portfolio with 872 items on sale, while the smaller (Vendor 4), with only one item on sale. All the vendors were found to be active within the time frame of the search.</p><h3>Quantitative analysis</h3><p>Overall, 3,089 products were retrieved for 25 vendors and classified in 12 different product types (<a href=\"#pone-0287231-t004\">Table 4</a>). Of these, 1.4% (n = 42) were COVID-19 related products (<a href=\"#pone-0287231-t004\">Table 4</a>). Vendor 18 were excluded from the analysis due to absence of any COVID-19-related items: the vendor was identified by the search algorithm due to the disguised sale of an illegal drug as a COVID-19 treatment. Vendors 5 and 13 were excluded due to the lack of further information on their portfolios. The most prevalent listing identified among the product types were medications (including antibiotics, steroids), with 1852 items (60% of all the sold products). Narcotics and unlicensed drugs were offered half as often as medications with 862 items (28%). Money-related products and financial services were identified in 163 cases (5%). Documentation and weapons were found in 2.3% and 1.9% respectively. <a href=\"#pone-0287231-t004\">Table 4</a> depicts the structure of the product types by vendors.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287231.t004\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287231.t004</a></p><p>In the majority of cases, each vendor dealt with limited product types. Namely, 15 of 22 vendors offered no more than three product types. The highest number of products offered were by Vendor 22 (n = 872) and Vendor 1 (n = 506), which specialized in medications (97%) and illicit drugs (99%). The widest range of products (n = 7) was offered by Vendor 24, which included medications (24%), illicit drugs (10.0%), money (30%), weapons (28%), technologies (67%), documents and COVID-19-vaccines (0.6%); and by Vendor 22 with medications (31%), illicit drugs (39%), money (20%), weapons (3%), COVID-19-masks and COVID-19-cure (1.6%) being listed.</p><p>Among advertised medications, the most prevalent were hormones (steroid and thyroid)– 911 items (49%), psychotropic medications 371 (20%) and drugs against erectile dysfunction– 331 (19%). <a href=\"#pone-0287231-g002\">Fig 2</a> depicts the structure of medication subgroups for 14 vendors.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287231.g002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287231.g002</a></p><p>The correlation analysis revealed associations between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 products. The COVID-19 vaccines were more likely to be sold by vendor specializing in weapons (r = 0.83, p&lt;0.001), money (r = 0.52, p = 0.014) and technologies (r = 0.45, p = 0.037); while COVID-cures were offered by those with commercial interests in general medications (r = 0.63, p = 0.002). COVID-medications were significantly less likely to be offered by the vendors dealing with documentations (r = -0.44, p = 0.04) (<a href=\"#pone-0287231-t005\">Table 5</a>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287231.t005\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287231.t005</a></p><p>Among the non-COVID-related items, financial services were more likely to be proposed in association with weapons (r = 0.60, p = 0.003) and hacking (r = 0.63, p = 0.002).</p><p>There were several correlates between COVID “cure” and particular medications (<a href=\"#pone-0287231-t006\">Table 6</a>). For instance, COVID-cures were more often provided by the vendors specialising in antibiotics, erectile stimulants, cardiotropic and antiviral drugs.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287231.t006\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287231.t006</a></p><h2>Discussion</h2><p>This study is one of the first to identify the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, fake test certificates and hypothetical/illegal cures across DWMs with a methodology which enabled a retrospective analysis of the darkweb content. For the products identified online, a correlation with the time frame of the pandemic milestones was identified. Moreover, the correlation between vendors’ portfolios of COVID-19 products and variety of other illicit goods, such as illegal weaponry, medication/drugs of abuse has been highlighted.</p><p>Overall, 42 listings of unlicenced COVID-19 products emerged from our searches for the period between March 2020 and October 2021. Products on offer were found to be time specific according to the unfolding of the pandemic (<a href=\"#pone-0287231-g001\">Fig 1</a>), in line with what reported by Bracci et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]. For instance, all the retrieved “certificates” [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>] were advertised for sale after August 2021 when individuals started travelling again after the lockdown [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>], with only one being advertised in June 2021 (<a href=\"#pone-0287231-t002\">Table 2</a>). Sold among a plethora of other fake documents, they varied from simple blank cards to supposedly “official” vaccination certificates authorised by healthcare professionals [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. They were made available for shipment in various countries including Europe, USA and Canada.</p><p>COVID-19 “cures” were first advertised on the dark net in late 2020 in the form of Hydroxychloroquine 100 mg (<a href=\"#pone-0287231-t002\">Table 2</a>) as a result of some media and scientific claims supporting its possible activity against COVID-19 symptoms [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>]. Once these claims were found inaccurate [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>], Hydroxychloroquine was quickly replaced by another two products IVERMECTIN and Amantadine (2021), with the latter gaining popularity as an aid to tackle the COVID-19 outbreak in India and Brazil [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>]. Both were advertised in 2020 and 2021 despite the declared ban applied by some DWMs on the advertisement and sale of legitimate/illicit vaccines. Although DWMs have sometimes a “code of conduct” and specific regulations against the sale of very harmful or immoral items (e.g., potent drugs of use/abuse, some types of pornography) [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>], the latter had no effect in this case. Remarkably, there are currently no effective strategies for preventing and deterring individuals from buying harmful products from the DWMs. These include those seeking drugs for recreational purposes, patients who are lacking both financial resources and health insurance wanting to purchase prescription drugs, sometimes (but not exclusively) to control pain as well as individuals who then resell the products on the street market [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>] In the case of our study, the offer of fake certifications and COVID-19 vaccines seemed to be aimed predominantly at those who preferred not to be vaccinated, but still needed a certification of vaccination for mobility, work, social and other reasons. On the other hand, “cures” for the COVID-19 seemed to target a more vulnerable cohort including individuals from countries where it was more difficult to manage timely health responses to the pandemic. Indeed, it is worth noting that effective vaccination campaigns and health care support have been mainly available in few and often wealthy countries, while the rest of the world (with very few exceptions like Cuba) was left behind due to insufficient vaccines stocks and inadequate infrastructures. Their contact with unscrupulous vendors selling a variety of other illicit goods, such illicit drugs, weapons, human organs among others, make their behaviour even more hazardous [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>].</p><p>Further, the identification of a specific timeline for each product’s appearance on the DWMs confirmed the very flexible and dynamic nature of such markets and their ability to follow external trends and adapt to the everchanging global supply and demand. We noticed that new criminal businesses became ‘active’ on demand when a new profit opportunity related to the pandemic emerged regardless of any pre-existing expertise or commercial experience (e.g., handling, distribution, sale). The fact that some of the 24 identified vendors displayed very small portfolios (with 1 or two COVID-19 related items) confirms the versatile and opportunistic nature of some actors in DWMs. As also emerged from Bracci et al., vendors often do not provide complete information on their listings but rather invite direct communication to facilitate sales. However, the larger part of the identified vendors were well established sellers displaying large and diversified portfolios (<a href=\"#pone-0287231-t004\">Table 4</a>). We also found a strong correlation between the COVID-19 related products and the sale of medications, licit or counterfeit, while vaccines and certificates were offered by those who traded fake currencies, weapons, counterfeit identity documentation and cyber frauds. These might have well been operated by large, organised crime groups rather than individuals.</p><p>In terms of methodologies, the innovative scraping techniques we used unable us to access data on both live/defunct marketplaces and active/unactive online vending sites, which would have not been possible via Tor or other standard DWM browsers. This reinforces the importance of using an intelligence-led approach to better target DWMs and vendors generating the greatest levels of risk or harm, which in turn may generate the greatest crime and harm reduction returns. Such efforts might be well combined with prevention and demand reduction activities aimed at educating and informing those purchasing products from these illicit marketplaces about the inherent risks and uncertainties of doing so. Buyers of the identified COVID-19 products, possibly led by misleading claims, have engaged in unethical, harmful, and irresponsible behaviours for themselves and society at large. In fact, it has been demonstrated that the severity of COVID-19 is greater in non-vaccinated individuals, with an associated increase in the transmissibility of the virus [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>]. To prevent such unwanted harmful consequences, further monitoring, and regulatory responses of DWMs should be considered to protect the health and safety of citizen especially at times of global crisis.</p><h3>Limitations</h3><p>This study has a few limitations; however, all efforts were made to minimise these throughout.</p><p>The data collected is restricted to that which has been seen and processed by the utilised Cybersolace platform, however this data-collection method has previously been successfully utilised by this research group [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>].</p><p>The limited sample size collected means generalisations about availability based on this data are restricted. However, as this research was largely exploratory and intended to identify the initial nature and extent of COVID-19 related products on DWMs with a view to informing policy response, we feel the insights generated are of value.</p><p>Furthermore, this study did not purchase any products advertised for sale on the observed DWM listings and so cannot testify the genuineness of the products listed available, nor their actual availability.</p><p>Furter analysis online on COVID-19 related products will involve the investigation of the correlation between the latter and the COVID-19 mortality or vaccine injection trends.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The identified availability and easy accessibility of a wide range of COVID-19 related products of illicit nature across 118 DWMs markets raise important health and safety concerns due both hazardous voluntary consumption and potential harm to others.</p><p>Considering the present COVID-19 scenario worldwide, it is expected that claimed cures, vaccines and certificates will keep being advertised on DWMs for the foreseeable future. However, the forms that these product-types take may be subject to change as requirements adjust around the world. In particular, new oral antiviral products (e.g., molnupiravir, nirmatrelvir and ritonavir) are currently being approved worldwide for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 infections [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref038\" class=\"ref-tip\">38</a>] and the future accessibility of these products will likely impact on their evolving availability on DWMs.</p><p>The results from this study point to the importance of using an intelligence-led approach to better target resources at those DWMs and vendors generating the greatest levels of risk or harm (which in turn may generate the greatest crime and harm reduction returns on this investment). This more targeted approach should continue to form part of a balanced and integrated DWM strategy which includes complimentary prevention and demand reduction activities aimed at educating and informing those purchasing products from these illicit marketplaces about the inherent risks and uncertainties of doing so.</p><p>It is important to continue monitoring these DWMs in order to assess the continuing sale of COVID-19 related products and to continually inform policy makers on the potential health risks connected to or posed by the sale of these products. Information campaigns targeted to DWMs’ potential clients and more vulnerable cohorts of people should be designed and disseminated, to discourage the purchase of such items. As reported by INTERPOL and the United States’ Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), “the risks to the public are clear: these can include buying a product which not only does not protect against COVID-19 but poses a serious health hazard if ingested or injected. Such products are not tested, regulated or safety-checked” [<a href=\"#pone.0287231.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>].</p><h2>References</h2><h3>Subject Areas <div id=\"subjInfo\">?</div>\\n    <div id=\"subjInfoText\">\\n      <p>For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/PLOS/plos-thesaurus/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link opens in new window\">here</a>.</p>\\n      <span class=\"inline-intro\">We want your feedback.</span> Do these Subject Areas make sense for this article?

Two literature reviews will be conducted to create an evidence base for co-management and COC suggestions that will be used to display guideline-compliant recommendations. Principles of machine learning will be used for further data processing and COC proposals for the postoperative course. In an observational and AI-development study, data will be collected in three surgical departments of a University Hospital (trauma surgery, general and visceral surgery, urology) for AI-training, feasibility testing of the MGDS and identification of co-management needs.

It has reduced time-to-surgery, hospital and long term mortality, length of stay, and complications in a variety of health care settings across the globe [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>]. Research has shown positive implications for different disciplines, such as trauma surgery [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>], general surgery [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>], oncological surgery [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>], urology [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>], and gynecology [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. Despite these advantages, restricted financial resources and a limited number of expert geriatricians and their multidisciplinary teams make a widespread implementation of geriatric co-management in hospitals challenging [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>].</p><p>A key aspect of geriatric co-management is a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) conducted by a multidisciplinary team. A CGA is a holistic approach for assessing a patient in different domains to determine physical, psychological, social, and functional impairments. Patients that underwent a CGA in the context of geriatric and surgical care are more likely to survive and less likely to be institutionalized [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. Another important aspect of geriatric co-management is individualized continuity of care (COC) planning. In complex health care systems, knowledge gaps concerning different options of continuous care for older people can lead to misdirection of patients. High level evidence indicates that a targeted discharge management reduces readmission rates, hospital length of stay, costs, and increases patient satisfaction [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>]. In contrast, deficits in coordination of care transitions between different health care institutions have been identified as one aspect of iatrogenic disability [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>].</p><p>In Germany, the amount of geriatric cases has doubled since 1999 and geriatric medicine has been the fastest growing clinical discipline in recent years [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. Prospectively collected data from the German fragility fracture registry confirmed the benefit of orthogeriatric co-management on mortality [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]. Still, not all patients in need for geriatric care are treated accordingly. For example, in the federal state of Baden-Wuerttemberg less than 5% of geriatric patients, defined by multidimensional screening (“Geriatrie Check BW”), received a geriatric assessment in general practice. Only 22%, 38%, and 2% of geriatric patients with a stroke, femoral fracture, or heart failure, respectively, received treatment in either a department for geriatric rehabilitation or early inpatient geriatric rehabilitation [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>].</p><p>Structures of geriatric care and options for the continuous care of older patients differ between federal states and regions [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]. Acute medical treatment with the option of early inpatient rehabilitation, day clinic medical treatment, and inpatient or outpatient geriatric rehabilitation can be available as individual or combined services. In Baden-Wuerttemberg, the main destinations after discharge of older people are inpatient acute geriatric care, inpatient acute care in another specialty, a geriatric or a specialized orthopedic or neurologic inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation, day care facilities, long term care facilities including nursing homes, or home with or without additional care.</p><p>Orthogeriatric co-management was announced to become a legal requirement for the treatment of older hip fracture patients in Germany by 2025 [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>], increasing demand for geriatric expertise. Digital health interventions could help meet this demand [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>]. To date, in geriatric medicine, digital technologies have been used to enhance patient assessment, e.g. via sensor-based gait analysis [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>], continuous mobility monitoring [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>], or digital patient-reported outcome measures for frailty assessment [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>]. In the United Kingdom the identification of patients in need of geriatric services is possible using an automated hospital frailty risk score based on health administrative data on medical diagnosis [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>]. Processing, analysis, and integration of these new data sources into existing structures is still lacking but has the potential to change common practice [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>].</p><p>By developing a digital health application, SURGE-Ahead (Supporting SURgery with GEriatric Co-Management and Artificial Intelligence) aims to bring geriatric expertise and support directly to the point of care in surgical departments in an effective and sustainable way.</p><h2>Methods</h2><p>The project aims to develop the SURGE-Ahead application (SAA, a dashboard-style user-interface) connected to the hospital information system (HIS) and the laboratory information system (LIS) that will display two core components: (1) evidence-based, easy-to-use clinical co-management recommendations and (2) artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced continuity of care (COC) proposals. Functionality of these two core components will be based on a minimum geriatric dataset (MGDS) consisting of data from different sources (<a href=\"#pone-0287230-g001\">Fig 1</a>).</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>The figure shows the data sources of the minimum geriatric data set (MGDS) describing support of geriatric co-management and continuity of care as the two core components. After processing this input, the SURGE-Ahead application (SAA) will display recommendations for these components as data output.</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287230.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287230.g001</a></p><p>The development, implementation, testing, and evaluation of the SURGE-Ahead application is a complex health care intervention. Therefore, SURGE-Ahead is structured according to the guidelines of the Medical Research Council (MRC) for development and evaluation of complex interventions [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>]. This development process encompasses four non-linear steps: Development, feasibility/piloting, implementation, and evaluation, with iterative improvements as the project progresses.</p><p>The current project focuses on the development of the SAA and will also prepare the implementation and piloting of the application. It is conducted in close cooperation with a multidisciplinary research team including geriatricians, computer scientists, surgeons, ethicists, epidemiologists, public health, and health economics specialists. Additionally, the team is supported by an international advisory board consisting of expert European geriatric researchers. The goals of the development phase are to establish an evidence base, develop a MGDS as input, and prepare evidence-based recommendations as output of the SAA. Furthermore, the digital application and its dashboard-style data user interface, data processing, AI integration, and connection to local hospital information system (HIS) and laboratory information system (LIS) will be programmed. The implementation of the SAA is prepared by analysis of local structures, stakeholder interviews, and functionality and usability tests with potential users. In a final step, AI training data will be gathered, co-management needs will be identified, and MGDS feasibility testing will be conducted in an observational and AI-development study. Ethical implications of the AI-enhanced digital health intervention will be constantly evaluated. The project has been reviewed in a peer-review- process and granted funding by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Sponsor had no influence on study design, collection, management, analysis, or interpretation of data.</p><p><a href=\"#pone-0287230-t001\">Table 1</a> summarizes the main objectives of the SURGE-Ahead project and <a href=\"#pone-0287230-g002\">Fig 2</a> shows a logic model describing the development and piloting process.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec2.fig2.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec2.fig2.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>The figure shows the different resources/inputs and activities as planned work and the outputs and outcomes as intended results of the project.

The review will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) and a protocol has been published in the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>]. Only evidence-based guidelines published between 2016 and 2021 evaluating the level of evidence (e.g., by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework) will be included. We chose to focus on orthogeriatric care because the highest-rated evidence in geriatric co-management exists in this field [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>].</p><h4>Continuity of care.</h4><p>The second core concept is the improvement of continuity of care decisions for older adults discharged from surgery. In a scoping review, eligible predictors and outcome measures of successful continuity of care decisions will be identified to be included in the MGDS and the AI algorithm used to propose the optimal discharge destination for each individual. As the topic and available literature is heterogenous including different study types, we decided to follow a scoping review approach. This methodology offers the opportunity for a broader view on a topic but supports only basic quantitative analysis [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>]. The scoping review methodology of the Joanna Biggs Institute (JBI) and the PRISMA-ScR [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>] will be followed. A protocol has been published on Open Science Framework (OSF) [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>].</p><h3>Development of the minimum geriatric data set (MGDS)</h3><p>The MGDS is set up to be the comprehensive input data set of the study. It focuses on two aspects: (1) to provide enough detail to represent relevant aspects of a proper CGA conducted by a multidisciplinary team, (2) to be as concise and short as possible to be conducted in surgical settings with limited time and human resources.</p><p>Based on preliminary results from the literature review on geriatric co-management, the following topics and domains relevant to geriatric surgical care have been identified: Activities of daily living (ADL), frailty and multimorbidity, incontinence, mental health (delirium, dementia, depression), mobility and falls, nutrition, pain, polypharmacy, sensory impairment, and social support. These domains have been discussed with an international advisory board. Based on the utility of the assessments for clinical decisions, parsimony of data, and feasibility for the use in the context of a surgical department a first MGDS has been defined. In the observational study, the defined MGDS will be tested for feasibility and adapted, if necessary. The future SAA will be connected to existing IT-systems to include available data from the HIS and LIS (e.g., medications, social anamnesis, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) codes, laboratory results). In addition, we plan to include sensor-data, particularly for mobility and functionality parameters, provided by a six-axis accelerometer (AX6®, Axivity Ltd.). With the collected data, the final results of the conducted reviews, and the information and feedback provided by contributing surgeons and the advisory board the MGDS will be finalized.</p><h3>Preparation of co-management recommendations</h3><p>On the basis of the systematic guideline review, evidence-based comprehensible co-management recommendations will be prepared for display as the output data of the SAA. The recommendations will cover identification and treatment of common geriatric syndromes like delirium, immobility or malnutrition. As an example, for patients with delirium or other cognitive impairments, resources and advice for non-pharmacological delirium prevention and management strategies should be provided to the treating medical teams [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, the SAA will incorporate an automated medication review plan to help manage polypharmacy and avoid potentially inappropriate medications (PIM). Optimizing medication in geriatric patients by deprescribing PIMs is an important aspect of geriatric co-management. Specifically, the reduction of anticholinergic medical burden is an integral part of multicomponent interventions to prevent delirium [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref038\" class=\"ref-tip\">38</a>]. Not only over- but also undertreatment is a problem in older patients, e.g., specific osteoporosis treatment is often neglected. To address these issues the dashboard will include an analysis of the patient’s medication based on the Fit for The Aged (FORTA) classification of medication. This will be provided by the external, commercial partner OptiMedis AG® [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>].</p><p>In addition, data collected during the pilot observational study will help to identify further needs for co-management in the local context, leading to an iterative improvement process. In a final step, the recommendations will be consolidated and approved by the scientific advisory board. The collected recommendations will be prepared for display in the digital dashboard.</p><h3>Programming of the digital SURGE-Ahead application (SAA)</h3><h4>Dashboard-style user interface.</h4><p>The front-end of the application will be based on the established Grafana framework, an open-source platform-independent application that allows the visualization of multiple data sources [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>]. All graphical dashboard elements in Grafana are independent widgets predefined to display single values or time series such as the patient’s age or change of assessment ratings over time, respectively. Alternatively, Grafana can be extended by custom elements to add new functionalities such as data input. This way, clinical staff will be able to enter patient data (e.g., weight or assessment scores) directly into the dashboard. All data will be stored in a secure Redis database run within the hospital network and visualized in the dashboard applying evidence-based recommendations and rules.</p><h4>AI for COC-recommendation.</h4><p>AI development follows the World Health Organization guidelines on ethics and governance of artificial intelligence for health [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>]. Based on the data collected in the observation and AI-development study, multiple machine learning models of variant complexity will be implemented using languages such as R, Python, and Julia [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>]. Both the expert recommendation of a geriatrician before discharge and follow-up data regarding COC quality will be evaluated as ground truth. A service will include the best-performing model and monitor incoming patient data to create or update COC-proposals. All new data will be used to retrain the model and constantly improve proposal accuracy. The model uncertainty and feature importance (i.e., parameters affecting the decision) will be displayed alongside each recommendation to improve model explainability and trust with the goal of a trustworthy AI according to the European Commission guidelines [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>].</p><h4>Linkage to HIS and LIS.</h4><p>Data relevant for the MGDS will be identified in the local HIS and LIS and an automated extraction from IT-systems will be prepared for the final SAA.</p><h3>Preparation of implementation in local context</h3><p>The departments for trauma surgery, general and visceral surgery, and urology of Ulm University Hospital will participate as the sites of primary implementation. As trauma surgery has the greatest need for geriatric co-management, a special focus will be put on this department. With the exception of the department of trauma surgery, where a liaison-based orthogeriatric co-management is already implemented, none of the other surgical departments have regular geriatric support.</p><p>Preparing the implementation of a complex intervention in the local context is an important step in the MRC framework. A lack of thorough preparation is a common reason why complex interventions do not transfer into clinical routine [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref045\" class=\"ref-tip\">45</a>]. Local routines and personal preferences of stakeholders and clinical staff have to be incorporated into the development process. Several steps will be taken to ensure participation of local staff and the fit of the intervention to local structures.</p><p>Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN 2.0) will be used to model and analyze an exemplary process of an emergency femoral neck fracture admission and surgery. BPMN is a high-level standard to graphically represent the steps in a workflow and particularly useful for complex processes [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref046\" class=\"ref-tip\">46</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref047\" class=\"ref-tip\">47</a>]. Institutions or departments, participating personnel, necessary tasks, gateways, and resources will all be included in the BPMN-model, helping to identify the best options for the dashboard implementation.</p><p>Expert interviews with surgeons, nurses, social workers, and therapist will be conducted to identify local needs and resources concerning geriatric co-management of older patients. Additionally, personal attitudes regarding ethical implications of the project will be investigated to be incorporated during the dashboard development and implementation as needed.</p><p>To further incorporate the views of local stakeholders, consultant and attending surgeons of each department will be involved in the project development and participate in regular workshops and conferences to discuss and consent proceedings of the project with the study group and the international advisory board.</p><p>Reducing workload for clinical practitioners is an important requirement for a successful digital application. In this context, not only an efficient technical connection to existing IT systems, but also an intuitive and user-friendly interface, will be important for the success of the technology [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref048\" class=\"ref-tip\">48</a>]. A prototype of the SAA will be evaluated and discussed with potential users of the application in a multi-stage, iterative process incorporating imaginary case examples as well as workshops. Usability, and functionality of the SAA will be evaluated with established tools such as the Technical Acceptance Model (TAM) or the Technology Usage Inventory (TUI) as well as self-designed feedback forms and improved accordingly [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref049\" class=\"ref-tip\">49</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref050\" class=\"ref-tip\">50</a>].</p><h3>Observation and AI-development study</h3><h4>Study design.</h4><p>A one-year prospective observational study with a 9-month recruitment and 3-month follow up period will be conducted in the departments of trauma surgery, general and visceral surgery, and urology starting in February 2023. The dashboard will not be displayed in the study, no intervention is planned. The main objectives are:</p><h4>Study population.</h4><p>Patients 70 years or older undergoing an emergency or elective surgery in the departments of trauma surgery, general and visceral surgery, or urology, an Identification of Seniors at Risk (ISAR)-Score of ≥2 and providing informed consent will be included [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref051\" class=\"ref-tip\">51</a>]. In case of recruitment barriers patients with an ISAR-Score of ≥1 will be considered as well.</p><p>Informed consent will be obtained from all participants by study doctors. If consent is not possible because of cognitive decline, legal representatives will be contacted. Patients with a life expectancy of less than 3 month according to clinical judgement will be excluded. Patients can withdraw their participation at any timepoint. Reasons for discontinuation will be assessed if possible.</p><h4>Sample size.</h4><p>Sample size is based on the minimum number of patients needed to train the AI algorithm [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref052\" class=\"ref-tip\">52</a>]. Because higher numbers will improve AI performance a recruitment corridor between 170 to 240 patients including an expected dropout rate of 20% will be aimed for. Recruitment will focus on the department of trauma surgery, as this is where the greatest range and variability of possible COC options are covered. In addition, the majority of geriatric trauma patients are emergency cases with underlying geriatric conditions and are more likely to benefit from a subsequent co-management. The following target allocation has been determined: 120–190 participants in trauma surgery, 25 participants in general and visceral surgery, and 25 participants in urology.</p><h4>Participants timeline.</h4><p>Preoperative assessments (T0) are divided into compulsory preoperative (T0.1) and optional preoperative (T0.2) assessments. To acknowledge the potential lower resilience of some participants, T0.2 assessments can either be collected pre- or postoperatively, including collateral history. The postoperative interviews and assessments will be performed on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 after surgery (T1-T4). From postoperative day 1 until day 7 the mobility sensor will be attached. If patients are discharged earlier, the postoperative assessments will only be performed until the day of discharge. One to three days before discharge, the discharge assessments will be performed and the expert COC proposal will be documented by a geriatrician. After discharge, final data from the hospital information system data will be recorded, especially adverse events and complications. The medical discharge report will be critically assessed in terms of completeness and quality (time independent) [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref053\" class=\"ref-tip\">53</a>]. A telephone follow-up will be performed with participants and general practitioners to evaluate COC decisions on discharge from surgery 90 days (± 7 days) after discharge (T6). Participants’ timeline is displayed in <a href=\"#pone-0287230-g003\">Fig 3</a>.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec2.sec6.sec4.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec2.sec6.sec4.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>HIS: Hospital Information System, LIS: Laboratory Information System, SURG: Surgery.</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287230.g003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287230.g003</a></p><h4>Data collection, management and monitoring.</h4><p>Data at baseline and follow-up visits will be collected via a self-programmed electronic case report form (eCRF) hosted within the hospital network. All assessors and study nurses will be trained in the assessments and eCRF usage and regular monitoring will be performed. 30 patients (10 from each department) will self-complete a paper-based activity diary to evaluate accuracy of sensor data algorithms. Trained scientific data managers will double-check collected data in the eCRF database and query inconsistencies directly with the study nurses. Because of this ongoing monitoring of data quality, a data monitoring committee will not be installed. All data will be stored in a pseudonymized fashion and filed for at least 10 years.</p><h4>Measurements.</h4><p><a href=\"#pone-0287230-g004\">Fig 4</a> shows all assessments and their schedule throughout the study phase.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec2.sec6.sec6.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec2.sec6.sec6.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>4-AT: 4 A´s test [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref057\" class=\"ref-tip\">57</a>], 5min-MoCA: 5-min Montreal Cognitive Assessment [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref058\" class=\"ref-tip\">58</a>], ASA: American Society of Anesthesiologists score, BI: Barthel Index [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref054\" class=\"ref-tip\">54</a>], cGFR: calculated glomerular filtration rate with Cockroft Gault formular, CHARMI: Charité Mobility Index [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref056\" class=\"ref-tip\">56</a>], CSSRI: Client Sociodemographic and Service Receipt Inventory [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref059\" class=\"ref-tip\">59</a>], CFS: Clinical Frailty Scale [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref060\" class=\"ref-tip\">60</a>], COC: continuity of care, CRP: c-reactive protein, EQ 5D-5L: EuroQoL 5D Health Questionnaire [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref061\" class=\"ref-tip\">61</a>], GTT: Global Trigger Tool [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref062\" class=\"ref-tip\">62</a>], HIS: hospital information system, LIS, Laboratory information system, MCV: mean cellular volume, NMS: New Mobility Score [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref055\" class=\"ref-tip\">55</a>], NRS-pain: Numeric rating scale pain, NRS-nutrition: nutrition risk scale [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref063\" class=\"ref-tip\">63</a>], PHQ-4: patient health questionnaire 4 items, QoL: Quality of Life.</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287230.g004\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287230.g004</a></p><p>Primary outcomes on level of care will be assessed in three ways:</p><p>Self-reported opinion of participants and general practitioners on COC process will be documented at 90 days follow up to assess appropriateness of COC.</p><p>Secondary outcomes are listed in <a href=\"#pone-0287230-g004\">Fig 4</a>.</p><h4>Statistics.</h4><p>To identify determinants of COC proposals, regression analyses as well as machine learning approaches will be used. Descriptive statistical methods will be used to highlight specific local needs for geriatric co-management, e.g. delirium prevalence. MGDS feasibility and data quality will be evaluated by analysis of missing data patterns. Subgroup analysis will be done in participants enrolled in trauma surgery as well as for the documented discharge destinations. SAS, R, Python and Stata software will be used for statistical analyses and imputation. Health economic analyses will be conducted from the payer perspective by a preliminary cost-utility analysis with the net-monetary benefit regression approach [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref064\" class=\"ref-tip\">64</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref066\" class=\"ref-tip\">66</a>]. Quality adjusted life years (QALY) will be estimated on the basis of the EQ-5D-5L using the current German value set [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref067\" class=\"ref-tip\">67</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref069\" class=\"ref-tip\">69</a>].</p><h4>Ethics approval and trial registration.</h4><p>This study received written ethical consent from the ethics committee of University of Ulm (# 310/22 dated 19th October 2022) (see <a href=\"#pone.0287230.s003\">S3</a> and <a href=\"#pone.0287230.s004\">S4</a> Files). Furthermore, the study has been registered in the German clinical trials registry (# DRKS00030684) on 21<sup>st</sup> November 2022.</p><h3>Ethical aspects of AI-enhanced health interventions</h3><p>An important point throughout the project is consideration of ethical concerns and challenges connected to the use of AI in medical care. The choice of suitable postsurgical treatment and care options is an important decision in surgical treatment and the responsibility of the treating consultant surgeon. Therefore, in the context of an AI-enhanced decision support tool, the proposals displayed by the dashboard have to be comprehensible and clearly marked as a suggestion not a decision.</p><p>Three requirements are indispensable for an adequate use of such AI-based support tool. Firstly, the treated patients need to be comprehensively informed about the use of such an application and potential risks of such use. The process of informed consent in case of AI-aided medical decision-making should encompass not only information disclosure but also understanding, voluntariness, and competence to decide [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref070\" class=\"ref-tip\">70</a>]. Secondly, to comprehensively inform patients, physicians need to have relevant knowledge and understand implications of the use of this technology. Therefore, tailored training of clinical staff in the area of medical AI is required [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref070\" class=\"ref-tip\">70</a>]. Thirdly, physicians using the application need to comprehend the rationale behind the AI-proposals. Use of “explainable AI” is recommended by the guidelines of the European Commission to increase trust and acceptance of the AI-generated suggestions for COC [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref071\" class=\"ref-tip\">71</a>].</p><p>A systematic review concerning ethical aspects of AI-enhanced medical technologies will be conducted. Interviews concerning this topic with local clinical staff as well as patients and caregivers will be conducted, giving them the opportunity to express concerns but also potential chances they might see in the project. These findings will be integrated into the development of the SAA.</p><h2>Discussion</h2><p>SURGE-Ahead aims do develop a complex digital health intervention, consisting of a digital version of a CGA presented in the user-friendly SAA that is connected to all relevant data sources and displays high-quality recommendations for geriatric co-management and COC decisions for geriatric patients undergoing a surgical procedure. According to the classification of digital health interventions of the World Health Organization, the programmed application can be categorized addressing clients, healthcare providers, and data services [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>]. Before proceeding to a validation study of the dashboard intervention, our application will need to undergo the legal process of the European and German medical device regulation. In a second phase of the project, the clinical impact of the application will be tested at different surgical departments of Ulm University Hospital in a pilot interventional study. In addition to the departments of trauma surgery, general and visceral surgery, and urology, the recruitment is planned to be conducted in the departments of gynecology and ear-nose-throat (ENT) medicine.</p><p>The SURGE-Ahead intervention has the potential to change clinical practice. Although most current evidence on geriatric co-management focuses on orthogeriatrics, a CGA and geriatric co-management have also been beneficial in other surgical disciplines and non-emergency admissions [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]. In a recent study, CGA concepts did not work without a geriatrician and a multidisciplinary team, presumably because of the need for expert CGA interpretation and general guidance of the care process [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref074\" class=\"ref-tip\">74</a>]. With a concise but comprehensive SAA we aim to partly overcome these issues by providing basic interpretation of MGDS data and AI-enhanced COC support. While for some geriatric patients, the automatically generated advice of the SAA might be sufficient to improve individual care, for others it might work as a differentiated screening tool for complex geriatric needs leading to a resource-oriented allocation of specific geriatric services [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>]. While established screening tools have shown deficits in patient selection for geriatric involvement [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref072\" class=\"ref-tip\">72</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref073\" class=\"ref-tip\">73</a>], the intervention can offer a low-threshold service that highlights needs and might improve patient selection.</p><p>The implementation of geriatric health research knowledge into clinical practice is still insufficient, which has been described as the `know-do’ gap [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref074\" class=\"ref-tip\">74</a>]. There are many reasons for this lack of implementation, including the multitude of specialized clinical disciplines treating geriatric patients and a lack of knowledge about geriatric medicine among health professionals in non-geriatric departments [<a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref075\" class=\"ref-tip\">75</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287230.ref076\" class=\"ref-tip\">76</a>].

Thus, studying self-assessed health status and underlying vulnerabilities is critical to provide insights to the program planners for effective and efficient planning of obesity prevention programs. This study aims to investigate the correlates of self-assessed health status and subsequently determine the obesity vulnerability level of residents in rural communities. Randomly sampled data were obtained from in-person community surveys in three rural Louisiana counties–East Carroll, Saint Helena, and Tensas–in June 2021. The association of social-demographic factors, grocery store choice, and exercise frequency with self-assessed health was investigated using the ordered logit model. An obesity vulnerability index was constructed using the weights obtained from the principal component analysis. The results show that gender, race, education, possession of children, exercise frequency, and grocery store choice significantly influence self-assessed health status. Around 20% of respondents fall into the most-vulnerable segment and 65% of respondents are vulnerable to obesity. The obesity vulnerability index ranged from -4.036 to 4.565, indicating a wide heterogeneity in the vulnerability level of rural residents. The findings show that the self-assessed health status of rural residents is not promising along with a high level of vulnerability to obesity. The findings from this study could serve as a reference in the policy discussion regarding an effective and efficient suite of interventions in rural communities to address obesity and promote well-being.</p><p><strong>Citation: </strong>Pathak S, Wang H, Seals K, Adusumilli NC, Holston D (2023) Self-assessed health status and obesity vulnerability in rural Louisiana: A cross-sectional analysis.

Obesity is disproportionately prevalent in the US and rural communities suffer higher (~34.2%) and at an increasing pace compared to their urban counterparts (~28.7%) [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>]. Since, a multitude of factors like genes, poor diet choices, limited exercise frequency, limited access to health care services, and social environment cause and influence obesity, addressing this epidemic is challenging [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. The aforementioned factors influencing obesity are more conducive in rural areas [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>], thus further exacerbating obesity prevention efforts.</p><p>To narrow the urban-rural gap in obesity prevalence, it is necessary to investigate the relationship between obesity risk factors and self-assessed health (SAH) at the community level. Furthermore, understanding how social, demographic, and behavioral factors operate within a rural community is critical to developing effective interventions to address obesity. Utilizing data on established risk and protective factors, a vulnerability index could serve as an important tool for decision-makers [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>] and health practitioners seeking to understand rural communities’ vulnerability to obesity. Such studies facilitate the development of equitable solutions for public health practitioners working to prevent obesity in rural communities. Because rural communities are often constrained by resources, expertise, and infrastructure, it is important for local decision-makers to have access to practical data that describes the health status and inequities of a community to facilitate precise targeting of available resources. It is also important for decision-makers to understand how individuals evaluate their health in general and how associated risk and preventative factors operate and are contextualized within a community. It is because SAH status is an important health indicator and predictor of future morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>].</p><p>The existing studies on SAH have centered their analyses on how and to what extent gender disparity [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>], healthcare access [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>], digital divide [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>], financial strain [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>], and fuel poverty [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>] influence SAH. However, studies that focus on rural residents regarding the determinants of SAH are only a few. Furthermore, despite obesity prevalence rapidly increasing in rural areas, to our knowledge, there is not any study that explores the vulnerability level of households or individuals concerning obesity. The index-based measure to assess the vulnerability level is widely used and provides a picturesque of underlying exposure to risks and the level of preventive efforts of households or communities [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>]. Such index-based measure also provides objective criterion that aids the planning and implementation of obesity-related interventions. Thus, we attempt to fill this gap in the literature by investigating two major research questions: <em>i</em>) What factors influence SAH status in rural areas? <em>ii</em>) What is the vulnerability level of the rural residents in terms of obesity? To this end, we employ the ordinal logit regression model and the principal component analysis on data from community surveys in three rural counties in Louisiana, USA. The results show that grocery store choice and exercise frequency significantly influence SAH status, besides sociodemographic variables such as gender, education, and interaction between age and race. Furthermore, our findings show that around two-thirds of the respondents are vulnerable to obesity, thus necessitating prompt preventative actions to promote healthy well-being in rural Louisiana.</p><p>This study adds to the existing body of literature, including Au and Johnston [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>], Dowd and Zajacova [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>], Gray et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>], Holston et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>], Karnes et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>], Hill et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>] and Myers et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>] on SAH, obesity, and rural health, in three ways. First, we explore the influence of grocery store choice, exercise frequency, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participation, and employment status on the SAH status in rural settings. The information about the influencing factors of SAH is important for health practitioners and local decision-makers to identify behavioral and social risk factors prevalent at the community level. Second, we introduce the obesity vulnerability index (OVI) that is relevant to the program planners and policymakers to make obesity prevention programs more targeted. The information about OVI and associated influencing factors could assist health practitioners, legislators, and local leaders to better target funding, precision interventions, and policies when addressing obesity in rural communities. Third, while health surveillance data is available at the state and county level, rural county-level data often lack representative samples creating a unique challenge when decision-makers are tasked with addressing public health issues. Using representative data, we aim to assist public health researchers and practitioners by identifying behavioral and socio-environmental characteristics of rural communities that put members at risk for obesity.</p><h2>Data and methods</h2><h3>Survey design and data collection</h3><p>Population-level data is ideal to study overall health status, obesity prevalence, and underlying population vulnerabilities; however, such data can be expensive and difficult to obtain, especially in rural communities. Utilizing representative survey data is a viable option to assess overall SAH and associated risk factors. This research uses representative cross-sectional data from the Rural Eastern Louisiana Food Accessibility and Active Transportation (RELFA) survey to investigate predictors of SAH and determine obesity vulnerability in three rural Louisiana counties: East Carroll, Saint Helena, and Tensas (<a href=\"#pone-0287181-g001\">Fig 1</a>). These three counties were selected because the obesity prevalence rate is over 40% and they remain priority areas of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to address obesity. All survey development and data collection processes were guided by the principles of Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) that prioritizes community engagement throughout all phases of research, including instrument development, data collection, and dissemination of results, to achieve equitable research [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>]. The questionnaire for the REFLA survey was developed in consultation with experts in nutrition and transportation, extension agents, community members, and bike advocacy leaders. Before formally launching the survey, a pilot test of the questionnaire was conducted with the community members in the study area to ensure comprehensibility.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec2.sec1.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>The inset map shows Louisiana in the contiguous United States.</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287181.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287181.g001</a></p><p>We used population data from the 2019 American Community Survey [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>] to determine the number of sample households in each community. To ensure survey responses were representative of the three rural counties under study, a probability sample (<em>n</em> = 811) using an online random number generator (<a href=\"https://www.checkmarket.com/sample-size-calculator/\">https://www.checkmarket.com/sample-size-calculator/</a>) was drawn from a comprehensive list of residential United States Postal Service (USPS) addresses for each community. Because data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic, data collection was initiated with postcards mailed to each randomly sampled address and included a website link and QR code to access the survey online. Following postcard data collection, in-person community data collection events were held in each community to survey all remaining addresses in the sample (<em>n</em> = 779). Altogether 51 community members were recruited by research and extension staff to go door-to-door to collect surveys in their community over two consecutive weekends in June 2021. Data collectors were trained by the research team on data collection protocols and survey administration and were provided with data collection supplies, including iPads that could be used without the internet, paper surveys, and personal protection equipment (PPE).</p><p>To ensure randomization, a replacement scheme was employed if the data collector found that the originally sampled address was vacant, deemed dangerous, or a business. Participants were eligible to participate in the survey if they lived in the parish of interest, were at least 18 years of age, and did some of the food shopping in the household. Survey refusals were not included in the replacement scheme. Written informed consent was obtained before proceeding with the questionnaire, and surveys were either collected via iPad using the offline Qualtrics application or on paper. Survey participants received a tote bag with promotional items when they completed the survey. Further details about the survey instrument development and data collection protocols have been published in Seals et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>].</p><p>The RELFA survey elicited information about food shopping behaviors, perceptions of local food environments, active transportation behaviors, perceptions of those who walk and bike for transportation, the household ownership of working vehicles and bicycles, SAH, and general demographics to inform obesity prevention program strategies. The LSU Agricultural Center Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the study procedures including the survey instrument (IRB# HE20-24) on May 15, 2020.</p><h3>Variables</h3><p>SAH is a commonly used measure in clinical practice, research, policy, and general population surveys as it provides a valid and reliable assessment of overall health status [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>]. In this study, SAH was elicited through a single question: “In general, would you say your health is….” There were five response alternatives: <em>poor</em>, <em>fair</em>, <em>good</em>, <em>very good</em>, and <em>excellent</em>. According to respondents’ self-perceived report, responses in these categories were 4.25%, 21.55%, 39.59%, 24.93%, and 9.68%, respectively. Since the frequency of responses in extreme categories, i.e., poor and excellent, were low, we merged the responses ‘poor’ and ‘fair’ as ‘fair’, and ‘very good’ and ‘excellent’ as ‘excellent’ during empirical analysis. SAH was then reclassified into three categories as: (a) fair = 1, if the respondent reports that her health is poor or fair; (b) good = 2, if the respondent reports that her health is good; and (c) excellent = 3, if the respondent reports that her health is very good or excellent. After recategorization, 25.81%, 39.59%, and 34.60% of the respondents fall into the fair, good, and excellent SAH categories, respectively. A broad range of SAH status determinants was included as explanatory variables in this study, including employment, possession of children, race, age, gender, physical activity, SNAP participation, educational level, store preference for buying food, and some interaction variables (i.e., <em>Race×Age</em>, <em>Race×Employment</em>, and <em>Employment×Children</em>). The description of the variables is given in <a href=\"#pone-0287181-t001\">Table 1</a>.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287181.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287181.t001</a></p><h3>Empirical analysis</h3><p>To answer our first research question that relates to assessing the factors influencing SAH, we used the ordinal logit regression model. Similarly, we used principal component analysis to answer our second research question about the construction of the obesity vulnerability index. A detailed explanation of our approach to empirical analysis is presented below.</p><h3>Ordered logit model</h3><p>The dependent variable, SAH, is measured by three ranked or ordered categories. Therefore, we applied the ordered logit regression model to evaluate what factors affect the overall SAH status of an individual. Following Long and Freese [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>], the specification of the ordered logit model can be expressed as\\n<a name=\"pone.0287181.e001\" id=\"pone.0287181.e001\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287181.e001\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(1)</span></span>\\nwhere <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287181.e002\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span> is a continuous latent variable representing SAH status for individual <em>i</em>. <em>x</em> is a vector of explanatory variables, <em>β</em> is a vector of parameters to be estimated, and <em>ε</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> denotes independent and identically distributed (<em>iid</em>) error term.</p><p>Here, <em>y</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> is the observed discrete, ordinal rating on a three-point scale for SAH status, i.e., <em>y</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> = 1,2, <em>or</em> 3 for poor, fair, and excellent categories, respectively. <em>y</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> is thus represented as\\n<a name=\"pone.0287181.e003\" id=\"pone.0287181.e003\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287181.e003\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(2)</span></span>\\nwhere <em>u</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>u</em><sub>2</sub> are known as threshold parameters (cut points) that can be estimated along with <em>β</em> and <em>u</em><sub>1</sub>&lt;<em>u</em><sub>2</sub>. The model estimation is performed by the maximum likelihood method. The maximum likelihood estimator can be represented as [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>]:\\n<a name=\"pone.0287181.e004\" id=\"pone.0287181.e004\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287181.e004\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(3)</span></span>\\nwhere, <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287181.e005\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span> and Eq (<a href=\"#pone.0287181.e006\">4</a>) is maximized with respect to (<em>β</em>, <em>u</em><sub>1</sub>, …, <em>u</em><sub><em>j</em>−1</sub>).</p><h3>Constructing obesity vulnerability index</h3><p>The index-based method to assess vulnerability is quite popular in social and environmental research and can readily be applied in the public health sector too. OVI provides a single representative value for obesity exposure and preventive efforts of households or individuals that could help policymakers calculate community risk from obesity and formulate plans accordingly. We used indicators such as SAH, level of physical activity, food purchasing behavior, and demographic information to construct an index that singly represents an aggregate picture of the obesity problem in the study area. The details regarding indicator variables are provided in <a href=\"#pone-0287181-t002\">Table 2</a>.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287181.t002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287181.t002</a></p><p>To make variables with different units comparable to each other, we standardized all the variables as\\n<a name=\"pone.0287181.e006\" id=\"pone.0287181.e006\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287181.e006\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(4)</span></span>\\nwhere <em>z</em> denotes the standardized score, <em>x</em><sub><em>k</em></sub> denotes <em>k</em><sup>th</sup> indicator variable, <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287181.e007\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span> is the mean value, <em>s</em> is the standard deviation, and <em>i</em> indexes observations. Using standardized values, we run principal component analysis (PCA) to calculate the weight of each indicator used to construct the OVI. PCA is a popular non-parametric tool that allows the use of a wide range of indicators while also providing credible unequal weighting to the indicators [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>].</p><p>Before running the PCA, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test was conducted to examine the sampling adequacy of data. The KMO measure was 0.593, indicating that the data are satisfactory for PCA analysis. The index value was obtained by multiplying the component 1 score from PCA (<a href=\"#pone-0287181-t002\">Table 2</a>) with the standardized value of each variable and summing them. The weights obtained from the PCA vary between -1 to +1 and the magnitude of the weights is an indication of the relative contribution of indicators to the OVI. We used the integrated vulnerability assessment framework of IPCC [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>] with the REFLA survey data for calculating the OVI. The vulnerability of a respondent to obesity is defined as the net value obtained by subtracting the level of preventive efforts from the overall sensitivity level:\\n<a name=\"pone.0287181.e008\" id=\"pone.0287181.e008\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287181.e008\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(5)</span></span></p><p>Based on this definition, the OVI can be expressed as\\n<a name=\"pone.0287181.e009\" id=\"pone.0287181.e009\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287181.e009\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(6)</span></span>\\nwhere OVI denotes the obesity vulnerability index, and <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> refer to the sensitivity and preventive efforts indicators, respectively. <em>w</em> stands for the weights obtained as first component loadings from principal component analysis for the <em>k</em><sup>th</sup> or <em>p</em><sup>th</sup> indicator, and <em>i</em> indexes respondents. Assigning weights based on the first component values is widely practiced and reliably assigns weights to construct an empirically valid index [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>]. A higher value of OVI indicates a higher vulnerability to obesity and vice versa; however, this is not an absolute but rather a subjective measure to facilitate comparative ranking among sampled respondents. The resulting OVI provides insights for strategic planning and weighing alternatives for coping with obesity. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata 17.</p><h2>Results</h2><p>The summary statistics of the variables under consideration are presented in <a href=\"#pone-0287181-t001\">Table 1</a>. Around 40% of the respondents reported SAH status as good (39.59%). Respondents’ average age was 50.83 years (SD = 16.99). Most respondents were female (62%), Black (80%), unemployed (58%), had only a high school degree or less (61%), and did not have children (56%). Similarly, 71% of respondents reported having at least 30 minutes of daily physical activities. In addition, about 35% of respondents participated in the SNAP. Majority of the respondents indicated that they buy most of their food from local stores such as Jong’s Super (26%), Greensburg Market (17%), and Mac’s Fresh Market (26%). Only around 22% of respondents buy their food from wholesale chains such as Walmart or Winn-Dixie indicating that respondents mostly choose cheaper areas to buy food.</p><h3>Factors influencing SAH</h3><p>One of the assumptions of the ordered logit model is the proportional odds or parallel regression assumption, which assumes that the relationship between each pair of outcome groups is the same. We test this assumption using the Brant test and the results from this test indicate that the parallel regression assumption holds (<em>χ</em><sup>2</sup> = value = 4.93; <em>p</em>-value &gt;0.295). Similarly, the likelihood ratio test statistic is 135.77 (<em>p</em> &lt;0.001), indicating that the model fits well with the data. The odds ratio values of the variables obtained from the ordered logit model are presented in <a href=\"#pone-0287181-t003\">Table 3</a>.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287181.t003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287181.t003</a></p><p>As shown in <a href=\"#pone-0287181-t003\">Table 3</a>, the odds ratio of being in a better SAH category is significantly higher if the respondent has children, belongs to the Black or African American race, has some college or above education, and has a high exercise frequency of at least 30 minutes per day. However, the odds ratio of being in a better SAH category is significantly lower if the respondent is female and goes to local grocery stores such as Jong’s Super and Greensburg Market to buy food.</p><p>Although the odds ratio is informative about the influence of a variable on SAH, it does not give precise information about how changes in the explanatory variables affect SAH. Thus, the most natural way to interpret an ordered response model is to determine how a marginal change in one explanatory variable changes the distribution of the response variable [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>]. The marginal effect indicates how the probabilities of being in a particular category of SAH change as we vary one variable and hold the remaining variable at their means. The marginal effects of the explanatory variables on SAH are also reported in <a href=\"#pone-0287181-t003\">Table 3</a>.</p><p>The results indicate that variables such as <em>having children</em>, <em>age</em>, <em>gender</em>, <em>exercise frequency</em>, <em>education level</em>, <em>store choice</em>, and the interaction of <em>race</em> and <em>age</em> significantly affect SAH rating as good. However, <em>employment status</em>, <em>race</em>, <em>SNAP participation</em>, <em>Race</em>×<em>Employment</em>, and <em>Race</em>×<em>Children</em> have no significant effects on the probability of reporting SAH as fair or excellent.</p><p>Having children is associated with a 7% and 2% decline in the probability of respondents rating their SAH in the fair and good categories, respectively, compared to those having no children. While the likelihood of a SAH rating as excellent increased by 9% for respondents with children. Each additional year of age increases the probability of reporting SAH as fair by 0.5% and good by 0.1%, but the chance of reporting excellent decreases by 0.6%. Similarly, probabilities of SAH being fair and good were respectively 6.5% and 1.5% higher for females compared to males while the probability of reporting excellent SAH reduced by 8% for females.</p><p>The marginal effect of physical activity on SAH shows that at least 30 minutes of exercise per day was associated with a decrease of 8% and 2% in the probabilities of SAH status as fair and good, respectively; however, the likelihood of an excellent SAH status increased by 10%. Moreover, the marginal effect of education level indicates that the probabilities of SAH rating as excellent increased by 16% and 15% for those who have some college training and an associate degree or above, respectively, compared to those who have a high school or less education level.</p><p>Regarding the food purchasing behavior, buying most of the food from local stores like Jong’s Super store was associated with an increase of 10% in the probabilities of SAH rating as fair, compared to those who buy most of their food from other stores; however, the likelihood of a SAH rating as excellent was reduced by 15%. Similarly, buying most of the food from another local market, Greensburg Market, was associated with a 16.1% increase in the probabilities of SAH rating as fair; however, the chance of reporting excellent SAH decreased by 20.7%.</p><p>The estimated marginal effect for the race-by-age interaction term indicated that probabilities of SAH ratings of fair and good were 0.6% and 0.2% higher, respectively, for each increment in years of age among Black or African Americans than Whites and others, while the chance of reporting excellent decreased by 0.8%.</p><h3>Obesity vulnerability index estimates</h3><p>The respondents in rural Louisiana have a mean OVI of 0.006, but ranges from -4.036 to 4.565, indicating a higher level of vulnerability to obesity. The distribution of OVI for respondents is presented in <a href=\"#pone-0287181-g002\">Fig 2</a>. The figure shows a wide discrepancy in the vulnerability level of individuals regarding obesity.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p><p>Note: The rank of the respondent is sorted in an ascending order based on index values.</p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287181.g002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287181.g002</a></p><p>To get more insights about the vulnerability to obesity of respondents, we further developed ordered quintiles of vulnerability categories: very low, low, medium, high, and very high. The frequency statistics of the vulnerability category are presented in <a href=\"#pone-0287181-t004\">Table 4</a>. Around 20% of the respondents fall into the most-vulnerable segment, and ~65% of respondents are vulnerable to obesity either being in the medium, high, or very high category.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287181.t004\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287181.t004</a></p><p>The breakdown of OVI by variable categories is described in <a href=\"#pone-0287181-t005\">Table 5</a>. Among the three counties in this study, Saint Helena (OVI = 0.291) is the most vulnerable to obesity, followed by East Carroll (OVI = 0.106) and Tensas (OVI = -0.414). Similarly, the 18–40 age category individual seems to be much more vulnerable to obesity (OVI = 0.781) compared to other age groups. Similarly, women (OVI = 0.150) are more vulnerable to obesity than men (OVI = -0.219). Furthermore, Black or African American respondents (OVI = 0.221) are more vulnerable to obesity than others. Similarly, having one or two bikes at home is associated with lower OVI; however, OVI is higher with the number of bikes &gt;3.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287181.t005\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287181.t005</a></p><h2>Discussion</h2><p>The findings from the study imply that grocery store choice and exercise frequency have significant associations with the overall SAH status, besides demographic factors such as gender, education, and age-race interaction. This is not unusual because local grocery stores provide few food choices compared to big box grocery stores. The negative influence of local grocery store choice implies that lower-income families have limited access to supermarkets and other healthy food retail outlets that provide varieties of affordable and nutritious foods. These limitations with local stores may be associated with poorer dietary choices and consequently reporting poor SAH. Similarly, rural infrastructure does not well support walking, running, or biking activities, thus exercise frequency is likely to be hampered that have implications for the SAH status of rural residents.</p><p>The significant value of race by age interaction term suggests that racial disparity in SAH is affected by the age of the respondent. In other words, with every additional year of age, Black respondents are less likely to value their SAH to be in the better categories. An unexpected result is a significantly positive association between race and SAH. A possible explanation is that more than 80% of respondents are black or African American, and almost 74% of these respondents reported their health status as good or excellent, which is largely reflected in the SAH. The positive association of having children with better SAH is in line with the findings by Fritzell and Gähler [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>].</p><p>The marginal effects for age had a significant and positive impact on the ‘fair’ and ‘good’ levels of health status but a negative sign on the ‘excellent’ level. In general, older people may have more disabilities and compromised health conditions that lead to poor SAH ratings compared with younger adults. The results are consistent with previous studies, including Andersen et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>], McFadden et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>], and Jurewicz and Kaleta [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>].</p><p>Generally, regular physical activity is one of the most important things people can do to improve their health. The more often an individual is physically active, the better their health status. The results are in line with previously published studies that suggested a positive relationship between physical activity and SAH [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref038\" class=\"ref-tip\">38</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>]. The significantly positive marginal effect of higher educational attainment on the excellent SAH category may be because educational attainment is associated with better health [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>]. Regarding the marginal effects of race, our results are consistent with the findings by Lee et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>] and Krok-Schoen et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>]. The authors found that older African Americans were more likely to rate SAH as poor. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<a href=\"#pone.0287181.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>] also reported that Black adults are more likely to report their general health status as fair or poor compared to White adults.</p><p>The results relating to OVI show that more than 65% of the respondents fall into vulnerable segments, either in the moderate, high, or very high category. Such a high level of vulnerability is an indication of the severity of obesity-related risks in the study area, thus prompting policy actions to cope with obesity in the study area. Furthermore, the OVI estimates suggest that the respondents with SAH as good, very good, and excellent are less vulnerable to obesity than those reporting fair or poor. This implies that respondents’ self-assessment of their health status is correct. The vulnerability to obesity decreased with the increasing frequency of exercise. The rate of decrease of OVI with 30-minute exercise is steeper up to 4 days per week, after which it starts to increase. This U-shaped relationship between exercise and OVI is interesting but unclear, thus needs further investigation. Having more vehicles in the home is also associated with higher OVI. One unusual observation from our study is that OVI is increasing when the number of bikes in a household is &gt;3. This needs additional investigation and might imply that using bikes is more important than merely having them. Having sidewalks on roads and the perception that traffic is safe for walking or biking around the residential area is associated with lower OVI. This has implications for Louisiana, where sidewalks are less common, and the crime rate is higher than in other states in the US. The results further imply that there is wide heterogeneity in the distribution of OVI by different categories of variables. Thus, targeting programs could be more useful in combating the obesity-related problem.</p><p>Policymakers and health practitioners need credible evidence before making decisions to address obesity in rural communities. This study uses representative data to determine risk and protective factors for obesity that could inform evidence-based interventions for decision-makers. First, results indicating that low-income households are more at risk for obesity reinforce the need for evidence-based nutrition and physical activity interventions targeted at low-income rural residents. Second, results show a lower risk of obesity associated with the presence of sidewalks and perceptions of safe walking and biking support policies and funding that improve pedestrian infrastructure and rural road design to encourage active transportation in rural communities. Lastly, the associations between grocery store choice and obesity vulnerability support policy and interventions that encourage improved access to healthy foods, both in terms of availability and affordability, in the rural food retail sector.</p><p>Although our study sheds light on how different factors influence SAH and the underlying vulnerability to obesity among rural residents, there are a few caveats with our analyses. First, only three Louisiana counties were included, which might limit the generalization of the study; however, these counties are still the priority of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) programs for preventing obesity. Second, we consider socioeconomic and health-related factors in constructing OVI; however, further research using more comprehensive data about actual diet choices could strengthen our findings. Third, survey respondents may not always have been the primary food purchaser of the household which could have impacted responses to questions about food shopping behaviors and experiences. Lastly, the inferences drawn using cross-sectional data could be bolstered by using household-level longitudinal data.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>Obesity is a rapidly emerging challenge for public health practitioners in the rural US. Thus, the information about the correlates of SAH status and the underlying vulnerability of the communities to obesity is critical to addressing burgeoning obesity-related problems. In this study, we used representative survey data from rural Louisiana to examine the socio-economic factors influencing SAH and calculated the OVI for low-income communities. The results suggest that interventions to increase grocery store choice and exercise infrastructure could promote SAH, thus lowering vulnerability to obesity. Since, majority (~65%) of the residents fall in the obesity-vulnerable segment, rolling out targeted prevention and control measures is very necessary to minimize the rural-urban gap in obesity prevalence.</p><p>Our findings further show that there is a wide heterogeneity in the vulnerability level of the rural residents, thus necessitating diversity in intervention groups instead of a blanket approach while implementing obesity prevention and control measures. The findings of this research provided insights into a policy discussion about designing an effective and efficient suite of interventions in low-income communities to fight obesity. As currently structured, only a few low-income communities are included in this study with an exclusive focus on northern Louisiana. Future studies could include all low-income communities to evaluate how individuals’ SAH level changes along with their socio-economic characteristics at a regional or state level. OVI estimates could be further strengthened by a more extensive study incorporating a broader range of variables at both household and community levels.

This report targets the effects of THC on the cardiovascular system of endotoxemic rats. In our 24-hour endotoxemic rat model (E. coli derived lipopolysaccharide, LPS i.v. 5mg/kg) with THC treatment (LPS+THC 10 mg/kg i.p.), we investigated cardiac function by echocariography and endothelium-dependent relaxation of the thoracic aorta by isometric force measurement compared to vehicle controls. To evaluate the molecular mechanism, we measured endothelial NOS and COX-2 density by immunohistochemistry; and determined the levels of cGMP, the oxidative stress marker 4-hydroxynonenal, the nitrative stress marker 3-nitrotyrosine, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymers. A decrease in end-systolic and end-diastolic ventricular volumes in the LPS group was observed, which was absent in LPS+THC animals. Endothelium-dependent relaxation was worsened by LPS but not in the LPS+THC group. LPS administration decreased the abundance of cannabinoid receptors. Oxidative-nitrative stress markers showed an increment, and cGMP, eNOS staining showed a decrement in response to LPS. THC only decreased the oxidative-nitrative stress but had no effect on cGMP and eNOS density. COX-2 staining was reduced by THC. We hypothesize that the reduced diastolic filling in the LPS group is a consequence of vascular dysfunction, preventable by THC. The mechanism of action of THC is not based on its local effect on aortic NO homeostasis. The reduced oxidative-nitrative stress and the COX-2 suggest the activation of an anti-inflammatory pathway.</p><p><strong>Citation: </strong>Bányai B, Répás C, Miklós Z, Johnsen J, Horváth EM, Benkő R (2023) Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol conserves cardiovascular functions in a rat model of endotoxemia: Involvement of endothelial molecular mechanisms and oxidative-nitrative stress.

Introduction</h2><p>In recent years, the effects of endo- and phytocannabinoids have become a field of increasing research, both for their therapeutic and recreational use.</p><p>The well-known signaling molecules of the endocannabinoid system are anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol. These signaling substances act through cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1R and CB2R), which are G protein-coupled receptors, coupled to G<sub>i/0</sub> protein. CB1R may also be involved in G<sub>s</sub>-dependent regulation. CB1R is a common receptor found on the surface of neurons and well known by its psychostimulant effects. In addition, it has cardiovascular effects [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>].</p><p>CB2R activation is not a psychostimulant, but CB2R mediated anti-inflammatory effects have been identified that make it a favorable therapeutic target. It is found on the surface of many cells in the periphery, e.g.: on white blood cells, on the surface of skeletal and smooth muscle cells, hepatocytes, and platelets [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>].</p><p>Recent research has shown that the activity of the endocannabinoid system shows different levels in health and in pathological conditions. Endocannabinoid system shows a characteristic protective activity under pathological conditions. The cardiovascular impact of cannabis has been an emerging area of research in recent years. On the other hand, cardiovascular research shows that stimulation of cannabinoid receptors in healthy individuals does not provide benefits. However, patients with inflammatory diseases, diabetes, obesity, sepsis, protective effects were observed, most of which were due to CB2R activation [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>].</p><p>The first known natural cannabinoid that was isolated from the hemp (Cannabis sativa) is Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is a partial agonist of both CB1R and CB2R [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>]. This property allows us to investigate both CB1R and CB2R signaling pathways together. In addition, recent research [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>] has shown that THC and other phytocannabinoids act not only through cannabinoid receptors but also through other signaling pathways, including PPARγ receptor (metabolic effects), as agonists of various TRPV channels, particularly via the TRPV1 (capsaicin) receptor (central nervous system effects), and allosteric modulator effects have been observed at glycine and μ/δ-opioid receptors. Agonist effects have been observed also on the newly identified \"orphan\" receptors; such as GPR-55 (G<sub>q</sub> coupled signaling) [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>], GPR-18, GPR-119. These receptors like CB receptors belong to the family of G protein coupled receptors [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>].</p><p>Endotoxemia leads to inflammatory responses and impairs the cardiovascular system, including endothelial dysfunction [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>] and increase oxidative- nitrative stress. Humans in septic shock have a 50% mortality. Besides an elevated metabolic rate, the adrenergic signaling becomes inefficient, as the liver produces octopamine that masks alpha-adrenergic receptors [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>], leading to systemic vasorelaxation. The cardiovascular response is biphasic: first, a hyperdynamic stage occurs with maintained blood pressure and an elevated cardiac output. The second stage starts when the heart cannot maintain the cardiac output necessary for the maintenance of blood pressure in the dilated vasculature. Rodents in sepsis develop cardiac dysfunction characterized by impaired contractility and endothelial dysfunction. Inflammation leads to an elevated (oxygen and nitric-oxide derived) free radical formation. The elevated oxidative and nitrative stress leads to non-specific modifications of lipids and proteins; moreover, single- and double-strain DNA damage also occurs. Mainly the single-strand DNA breaks activate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1). PARP utilizes NAD<sup>+</sup> to build ADP-ribose polymers (PAR), attaches to histones and help repair mechanisms. PAR-ylation refers to a specific protein modification process that alters the cell’s self-regulatory mechanisms, such as DNA repair, gene transcription, apoptosis and cell metabolism. However, it can lead to NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion, hence, to energetic failure of the cells. The abundance of PAR can be used as a marker of DNA damage. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and the concomitant cellular damage also contribute to the development of cardiovascular diseases [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>].</p><p>In the present study, we investigated endotoxemia induced cardiovascular damages and the oxidative-nitrative stress parameters in a rat model of endotoxemia combined with THC treatment as a possible therapeutic agent.</p><h2>2. Materials and methods</h2><p>All investigations conform to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85–23, Revised 1985) and all procedures were approved by the Semmelweis University Committee on the Ethical Use of Experimental Animals (590/99 Rh).</p><h3>2.1. Animals</h3><p>Eight age-matched Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 280–350 g were administered a single dose of 10 mg/kg intraperitoneal Δ<sup>9</sup>-tertahydrocannabinol (THC) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), solubilized in ethanol:saline: 1:2. 5 to 10 minutes later the animals were administered 5 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS, from Escherichia coli, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) intravenously, suspended in saline. Twelve animals received only the solvent alcohol-saline mix intraperitoneally before the injection of LPS (positive controls), another twelve rats were injected with solvent alcohol-saline mix intraperitoneally and saline intravenously (negative controls). The animals remained in the following 24 hours in their usual environment. As 5 mg/kg LPS causes hyperalgesia, their wellbeing was checked in this period, but they did not receive anesthetics, because anti-inflammatory drugs or opiates would have interfered with the measurements. Echocardiography, cardiovascular measurements and collection of tissue specimens took place 24 hours after LPS treatment under anesthesia (description of anesthesia is provided at the specific measurement). The animals were killed in deep anesthesia by bleeding and opening of the chest wall.</p><h3>2.2. Echocardiography</h3><p>For echocardiographic studies, animals were superficially anesthetized with 1.3 g/kg urethane. A Hewlett Packard Sonos 5500 ultrasound machine equipped with a 7–15 MHzlinear ultrasound probe was used to capture video loops of 5–6 cardiac cycles. Two-dimensional longitudinal recordings of the left ventricle were used to measure end-systolic volume (ESV), end-diastolic volume (EDV) and stroke volume (SV), as described previously [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. Ejection fraction was also calculated as SV/EDV. In each experiment, 3 end-systolic and 3 end-diastolic images were selected for analysis, and the average of the 3 measurements was used for further analysis.</p><p>The thickness of the left ventricular wall was determined by taking cross-sectional images of the ventricle at the level of the papillary muscles. Fractional shortening (FS) was also determined as the ratio of the shortening in internal diameter during systole and the end-diastolic internal diameter.</p><p>The duration of cardiac cycles, and heart rate was determined using M-mode recordings.</p><h3>2.3. Examination of blood pressure and left ventricular function</h3><p>The animals were anesthetized with i.p. injections of 60 mg/kg thiopentone sodium (Nembutal, Phylaxia-Sanofi, Hungary). The right femoral artery was cannulated for measuring the arterial blood pressure and a catheter were inserted into the left ventricle via the right carotid artery (PE50 tube, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA.) Data were collected and evaluated using Biopac system (Biopac, Goleta, CA, USA). Heart rate (HR), left ventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressure (LVSP and LVEDP) were measured and mean arterial pressure (MAP), left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) were calculated. In order to estimate ionotropy and lusitropy, the maximal slope of left ventricular contraction (dP/dt) and minimum slope of left ventricular relaxation (-dP/dt) were also calculated.</p><h3>2.4. Measurement of vascular reactivity on isolated aortic rings of rats</h3><p>The method to determine endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation in thoracic aortic rings from rats was described previously [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>]. Briefly, the thoracic aorta was isolated from the barbiturate-anaesthetized rats, cleared from periadventitial fat and cut into 3–4 mm width rings, mounted in organ baths filled with warmed (37 °C) and oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2 –Carbogen Lindegas) Krebs’ solution (CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.6 mM; MgSO<sub>4</sub> 1.17 mM; NaCl 130 mM; NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 14.9 mM; KCl 4.7 mM; KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.18 mM; Glucose 11 mM). Isometric tension was measured with isometric transducers (10 cm<sup>3</sup> capacity, vertical training organ bath system, Experimetria Ltd. Budapest, Hungary, digitized, stored and displayed by a software developed by Experimetria, Hungary.) A tension of 1.5 gram was applied and the rings were equilibrated for 60 minutes, followed with epinephrine dose-response curve (10<sup>−10</sup>–3*10<sup>−6</sup> M) and, after a 30 to 60 minute-long washout period, the rings were precontraced with epinephrine (10<sup>−</sup><sub>6</sub> M) and concentration-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine (Ach, 10<sup>−9</sup> to 3 * 10<sup>−</sup><sub>4</sub> M) was measured. Experiments were conducted in 5–6 pairs of rings in each experimental group.</p><h3>2.5. Malonyl-dialdehyde assay</h3><p>Serum was isolated for malondialdehyde detection. The samples were stored at -80 °C until the time of analysis. Samples were homogenized with 0.5 ml of 1.15% KCl solution and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for approximately 30 min until the supernatant was completely clear. On a standard microplate the following solutions were added to the wells: sodium dodecyl sulfate (8.1%), acetic acid (20%), water, the supernatant, thiobarbituric acid (0.8%) and incubated at 95 °C for one hour. Concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive product was measured by photometry at 532 nm (PowerWave XS, BioTek Instruments, CA, USA.).</p><h3>2.6. Immunohistochemical staining</h3><p>Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections of the thoracic aorta and the heart against poly(ADP-ribose) polymers (PAR), cannabinoid receptor 1 and 2 (CB1R and CB2R); cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), cyclic guanosine-monophosphate (cGMP) and 3-nitrotyrosine (NT). After deparaffinization, antigens were retrieved by heating the slides in citrate buffer (pH = 3 PAR, CB2R or pH = 6 CB1R, COX-2, eNOS and HNE; for cGMP and NT, we did not apply antigen retrieval). We blocked endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in distilled H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Nonspecific labeling was blocked using 2.5% normal horse serum (Vector Biolabs, Burlingame, CA, U.S.A.). After overnight application of primary antibodies (monoclonal mouse anti-eNOS 1:50, Abcam Cambridge, UK; polyclonal rabbit anti-COX-2 1:200, Abcam Cambridge, UK; polyclonal rabbit anti-cGMP 1: 500, Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA; U.S.A., polyclonal rabbit anti-NT 1: 500, Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA; USA, polyclonal rabbit anti-HNE 1:200, Abcam Cambridge, UK; monoclonal mouse anti-PAR 1:500 Abcam Cambridge, UK; polyclonal rabbit anti-CB1R 1:200, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor Michigan U.S.A.; polyclonal rabbit anti-CB2R 1:150, Fabgennix, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, U.S.A.) at 4°C, horseradish-peroxidase- (HRP-) linked anti-mouse (PAR, eNOS) or anti-rabbit (NT, HNE, CB1R, CB2R, cGMP, COX-2) horse antibodies (Vector Biolabs, Burlingame, CA, U.S.A.) provided secondary labeling, which was visualized by brown-colored diamino-benzidine (DAB, Vector Biolabs, Burlingame, CA, U.S.A.). For counterstaining, blue-colored hematoxylin (Vector Biolabs, Burlingame, CA, U.S.A.) was utilized. Nikon Eclipse Ni-U microscope with DS-Ri2 camera (Nikon Minato—Tokyo Japan) was used for microscopic imaging of tissue sections. Positively stained area (brown coloring) over whole tissue area (area%) of the endothelium (eNOS and COX-2) and of the media (CB1R, HNE, NT, cGMP); and positively stained nuclear area over whole nuclear area in the media (nuclear area%, PAR) were estimated by ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MA, U.S.A.).</p><h3>2.7. Statistical analysis</h3><p>Results are reported as mean ± Standard Error of the Mean (vascular relaxation) or mean ± Standard Error. Statistical significance between groups was determined by repeated measure two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni’s multiple comparison (aortic rings), one-way ANOVA with Tuckey’s multiple comparison (malonyl-dialdehyde assay, cardiac measurements), or Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc test (immunohistochemistry results). Probability values of P &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. All relevant data are within the manuscript and the <a href=\"#pone.0287168.s001\">S1 File</a>.</p><h2>3. Results</h2><h3>3.1.

Discussion</h2><p>In our model, LPS caused a marked decrement in the abundance of CB1R and a strong tendency decreasing CB2R. Nevertheless, Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol salvaged the cardiovascular functions of endotoxemic rats, decreased oxidative-nitrative stress and the detectable amount of inducible cyclooxygenase, but the restored endothelium-mediated relaxation was not dependent on endothelial nitric oxide synthase abundance or cGMP levels.</p><h3>4.1. Cardiac functions in endotoxemia</h3><p>In the clinics, changes in the circulation occurs in two steps in patients with sepsis. At first, the generalized inflammation leads to systemic vasorelaxation, but the heart is able to maintain the cardiac output necessary for proper tissue perfusion (hyperdynamic stage). The exhaustion of the heart leads to the second phase, the blood pressure decreases and the tissue perfusion becomes insufficient (hypodynamic stage). However, 5 mg/kg LPS is below the lethal dose in rodents [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. In our experiments, the lethality of LPS was 0% (no animal died within the 24-hour waiting period), and the LPS-inoculated mice did not show signs of severe distress (no anxiety, their eyes were clear and their fur was smooth.)</p><p>Our model pointed toward vascular damages behind the compromised ventricular filling and cardiac output; therefore, we propose that the alteration of cardiac parameters (EDV and ESV) are the consequences of large vessel dysfunction. The reduced cardiac output can be the result of decreased ventricular filling. Previous studies performed on murine and rat models revealed a decrement in inotropy in similar models of endotoxemia, utilizing 5 mg/kg LPS. However, in these studies only a four- to six-hour long period was assessed [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>].</p><p>Peng et al. used an LPS dosage of 4 mg/kg and investigated the effect after 4 and 24 hours’ incubation [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]. The heart rate did not change due to LPS treatment in either of these studies. Pacher et al. also found ambivalent results—based on their review, THC can be cardio protective in low dosage in a dose dependent manner, or harmful to the cardiac system in higher dosages [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>].</p><p>In the cardiac samples, only the oxidative stress marker hydroxy-nonenal was elevated, concomitant to systemic elevation of oxidative stress. Therefore, our results are findings can be the consequences of an altered vascular function, and direct cardiac injury cannot be established.</p><p>In endotoxemia, an activation of the renin-angiotensin system occurs and the biologically active angiotensin II level elevates; however, the vascular sensitivity to angiotensin decreases [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>]. The lack of CB1R leads to increased vasoconstriction during acute angiotensin II stimulation [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>], hence angiotensin-mediated vasoconstriction may have been altered by THC. The cardiac effects of angiotensin-related cannabinoid signaling are dual, as it influences inotropy and coronary blood flow simultaneously [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>]. The activation of CB2R showed beneficial effects in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>], neuroinflammation after traumatic brain injury [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>], or in rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>]. The CB1R antagonist Rimonabant was cardioprotective in a rodent model of myocardial infarction [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>] and decreased matrix metalloproteinase activity after spinal cord injury [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>].</p><h3>4.2. Vasoprotective effects of Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol</h3><p>In our study THC treatment was able to restore Ach sensitivity of thoracic aortic rings that had been damaged by LPS treatment, suggesting that THC may ameliorate LPS induced endothelial dysfunction. However, we also detected a decrement in both CB1R and CB2R abundance in the aortic wall as a response to LPS challenge.</p><p>Navarro Dorado <em>et al</em>. assessed the effects of chronic nonselective CB agonist and antagonist (WIN55 &amp; JWH133) dosage in a transgenic model of Alzheimer’s disease. In their model, nonselective CBR activation restored the acetylcholine-induced relaxation [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>].</p><p>O’Sulivan et al. found that THC had a time dependent vasorelaxing effect (after an acute vasoconstictor effect) through PPAR-γ activation, which is not CB1R dependent [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>]. On the other hand, according to Stanley <em>et al</em>. canabidiol (CBD), which is another phytocannabinoid, also causes time dependent vasorelaxation but in this case it is CB1R mediated and endothelium-dependent [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>]. The different results may be due to the fact that while the former case used a healthy rat model, the latter used human samples from poly-morbid patients. The cannabinoid system is also involved in the regulation of the blood flow of the brain during hypoxia and hypercapnia [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>]. However, in these models, the research assessed the direct vasorelaxant effects of cannabinoid agonists, whereas, in our study, the indirect vasoprotective effect of THC was detected, as THC has a short half-life of only 2 minutes, when administered intravenously; and because the downregulation of the cannabinoid receptors.</p><p>Other studies about streptozotocin induced diabetic cardiomyopathy showed similar results after chronic cannabinoid treatment. The Ach induced vasorelaxation also decreased in the streptozotocin-induced group and THC was able to restore this vasodilator capability. According to their results, the trends in oxidative-nitrative stress was comparable to our findings: streptozotocin significantly increased lipid peroxidation and nitrative stress markers, which were restored by THC [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref038\" class=\"ref-tip\">38</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>].</p><p>The low eNOS and cGMP levels and the maintained endothelium-dependent relaxation in the LPS+THC group are contradicting findings. The relaxation of a vessel depends on the balance between vasoconstrictor and vasodilator messengers. The decreased COX-2 detectability may indicate a reduced thromboxane A2 (TxA2) production in the THC-treated group; therefore, even with a decreased NO bioavailability, the aortic relaxation may be maintained in vitro.</p><p>In vivo, the augmented ventricular filling may be the result of the maintained vascular function due to the controlled oxidative-nitrative stress and the absence of elevated TxA2 release from the endothelial cells and platelets, as thrombocyte function is also altered in endotoxemia. In the presence of adenosine diphosphate, LPS-challenged platelets release hydrogen-peroxide and TxA2 [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>]. Upon activation, platelets and macrophages may also contribute to the developing hypotension in septic state by releasing 2-arachidonyl glycerol and anandamide; the hypotension was proven preventable with CB1R antagonists [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>]. Furthermore, chronic marijuana abuse leads to an increased risk of thrombus formation by platelet activation; however, the basis of the thrombosis is strongly connected to cannabis arteritis [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>].</p><h3>4.3. Anti-inflammatory effects of Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol</h3><p>In our model, the aortic density of the inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and nitrative stress (detected by 3-nitrotyrosine staining) were decreased in the THC-treated rats. As the endothelial nitric oxide synthase was also decreased along with the cGMP levels, the results suggest a decreased activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). These results are supported by numerous studies, first mentioning the study by Joffre <em>et al</em>. In a complex experiment involving several knock-out strains, the effects of THC and other cannabinoid agonists were monitored during LPS treatments at different doses, and the results showed that cannabinoids significantly decreased the concentration of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, CCL-2) and increased the concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>]. These anti-inflammatory properties of THC were also suggested by Suryavanshi <em>et al</em>., on lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response in human THP-1 macrophages and primary human bronchial epithelial cells [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref045\" class=\"ref-tip\">45</a>] and Szekely <em>et al</em>. on LPS-challenged whole human blood cells [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref046\" class=\"ref-tip\">46</a>]. In the latter two models, a cytokine storm-like response developed that was successfully ameliorated by THC. Similar, promising results came forward in the latter years, suggesting the potential immunomodulatory properties of cannabinoids, which may have therapeutic potential [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref047\" class=\"ref-tip\">47</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref049\" class=\"ref-tip\">49</a>].</p><h3>4.4. Changes in cannabinoid receptor 1 density in endotoxemia</h3><p>CB1R is involved, as it is highly expressed within the cardiac and vascular cells, as well as on the endothelial cells and a suggested vascular smooth muscle receptor for cannabinoids. Our results suggest a decreased cannabinoid receptor 1. and 2. presence in the aorta during endotoxemia. The downregulation of biologically available cannabinoid receptors can be a result of decreased expression or increased receptor turnover.</p><p>Another important mode of signaling is through alternation by β-arrestin2, leading to receptor internalization and desensitization of the cells. Hunyady and his team discovered differences in affinity to β-arrestin2 of cannabinoid receptor 1 and 2 [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref050\" class=\"ref-tip\">50</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref051\" class=\"ref-tip\">51</a>], in two different missense polymorphisms of CB2R. One of the mutant receptors showed decreased affinity to β-arrestin2. In case of the control rats, the relatively large deviation in cannabinoid receptor density may be a result of a genetic polymorphism in the receptor transcription, trafficking or turnover.</p><p>Differences between mutants and wild-type CB2R within the population causes changes in cAMP levels, as well as downstream MAPK/PI3K signaling, especially when stimulated for an extended amount of time, probably due to receptor internalization and trafficking. Further on, this may play an important role in the endocannabinoid system response, as well as in the pathogenesis of various diseases.</p><p>In endotoxemia, the involvement of the cannabinoid system is presented. An elevation of macrophage- and platelet-derived endogenous cannabinoid concentration can be detected, that may contribute to the hemodynamic changes via CB1R activation [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref052\" class=\"ref-tip\">52</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref054\" class=\"ref-tip\">54</a>]; on the other hand, it may also reduce leukocyte adhesion by a CB2R mediated pathway [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref055\" class=\"ref-tip\">55</a>]. Grunewald et al. even suggested that an increment of endogenous cannabinoid production contributes to the LPS-mediated insulin resistance in obesity [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref056\" class=\"ref-tip\">56</a>]. However, downregulation of CB1R density in the large arteries of endotoxemic animals was not detected, because it was not investigated, as studies usually target the amount of the endogenous ligands and not the receptor density. Although, in T-cells, CB1R transcription elevated as a response to THC treatment [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref057\" class=\"ref-tip\">57</a>]. The decreased CB1R density may explain, why our rats needed 10 mg/kg THC, instead of 2 mg/kg, and similar studies also use comparable doses of THC [<a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287168.ref058\" class=\"ref-tip\">58</a>].</p><h2>5. Conclusion</h2><p>The presented results support the notion that a non-selective CB1/2R agonist–partial antagonist may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of sepsis. In our model, the decrement of cardiac filling and the consequential decline of the cardiac output was prevented by THC treatment, due to the maintained endothelial function. One possible mechanism of the more pronounced endothelium-mediated vasodilation is the decreased thromboxane A2 release due to the lessened inducible cyclooxygenase expression, the other salvaging mechanism is the dampened oxidative-nitrative stress. The activation of endocannabinoid system in inflammation and endotoxemia was earlier described; however, the diminished abundance of both cannabinoid receptors in endotoxemia was not detected. The decreased oxidative-nitrative stress and DNA damage are potentially beneficial in a systemic inflammation, and the reduced inflammatory response may help in the prevention to a quick and robust pro-inflammatory cytokine release (cytokine storm).</p><h2>Supporting information</h2><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287168.s001\">S1 File. </a></h3><p class=\"preSiDOI\">Contains all collected data that were the basis of all statistical analyses, organized according to the figures, in the following order: <a href=\"#pone-0287168-g001\">Fig 1</a>.

Introduction</h2><p>In the past two decades, the emission reduction of greenhouse gases, mainly represented by carbon dioxide, has become an increasingly concerned issue globally [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>]. The abnormal climate events all over the world in recent years have attracted people’s attention to the global warming phenomenon. The concept of low carbon has increasingly infiltrated into all aspects of society, especially in the economic field ([<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>]). As a major carbon emission country, China has put forward specific implementation plans such as \"Blue Sky Action\", made efforts in the emission of air pollutants and greenhouse gases, and made significant contributions to the improvement of the global atmospheric environment. In 2019, China further solemnly made a commitment to the \"double carbon\" goal to the world [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. The construction and management of low carbon supply chain is an important component and necessary means of low carbon economy development. The core of low carbon supply chain is to replace high carbon product with low carbon product. It requires cooperative efforts from manufacturers to retailers, and it is a long term and gradual process, because consumers also have their own buying habits and preferences.</p><p>With the rapid development of e-commerce, many enterprises choose the dual channel, such as Nike, Dell and Apple [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>]. Enterprises can reach more consumers through direct channel to achieve the goal of rapid product promotion. In practice, many manufacturers will choose traditional channel to sell products without technological innovation and direct channel sell products with new technologies to consumers [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>]. Traditional channel product and direct channel product usually have a certain degree of substitutability in terms of functionality, therefore the two products have market competition. It is very complicated for manufacturer to determine the channel strategy, as well as the selling prices of the two products. Manufacturers and retailers in the dual channel supply chain should take into account how to efficiently realize the comprehensive construction of the low carbon dual channel supply chain, and formulate reasonable wholesale and retail prices, coordinate sales channels for low carbon product and high carbon product. These are not only the heated issues in the current academic areas, but also the problem that practitioners of all the industrial sections should consider and solve [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. The development of low-carbon economy, especially the low carbon dual channel supply chain, should first be regulated by the government which plays a leading role, formulates corresponding laws and regulations, integrates and allocates social resources, as well as supports the development of low-carbon industry and the promotion of low-carbon technology [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. Government policies that have a direct impact on the low carbon supply chain mainly include carbon tax and low carbon subsidy. At present, carbon tax is chiefly levied in some developed countries and regions, mostly in Europe. And their experiences have proved that carbon tax levied on enterprises can reduce carbon emission and even change the consumption pattern of ordinary people, the impact of this measure on enterprises, environment and national competitiveness needs careful investigation and assessment ([<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]). China is also actively preparing for the establishment of a carbon tax system. The special research panel on carbon tax led by the Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance has issued a research report, which analyzes the necessity and feasibility of levying carbon tax in terms of theory, policy and technology, and puts forward the basic objectives and principles of levying carbon tax in China [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>]. On the other hand, government subsidy for low-carbon supply chain can also encourage enterprises to optimize the construction of green supply chain and play an incentive role in carbon emission reduction. For example, &lt;Interim Measures for the Administration of Subsidies for Energy Conservation and Emission reduction&gt; (2015) issued by the Ministry of Finance of China aims to encourage enterprises to increase investment in energy conservation and emission reduction by using subsidy policies [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>]. In addition, the government’s low carbon subsidy to consumers buying low carbon product will also change people’s purchase choices of products and accelerate the substitution of low carbon product [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>].</p><p>Under such background, we propose the following questions:</p><p>The remaining of the paper is arranged as the following sections: Section 2 reviews the previous research literatures, summarizes their main directions as well as shortcomings, and points out the gaps to be filled in this study. Section 3 is the introduction of the research model, which describes the dual channel supply chain model considering the substitution of high carbon and low carbon product established in this study, and the definition of the parameters in the model. Section 4 calculates the performance of the above supply chain model under the three modes of subsidy, carbon tax and subsidy + carbon tax, focused on performance of parameters such as product demand, manufacturer profit, retailer profit and social welfare. Section 5 is a numerical example analysis, bringing in specific values from real cases to further test the numerical performance of each parameter of the supply chain considering the two products under the three modes. Section 6 is the conclusion, which summarizes the main findings and significance of this study, reviews existing defects to be further improved, and makes a prospect for future research.</p><h2>2. Literature review</h2><p>To construct low-carbon supply chain and promote it to replace the traditional high-energy-consuming supply chain forms, theoretical researches should be carried out concerning all the aspects in low-carbon supply chain development. In this section we have a review about the literatures falling into three topics: low-carbon supply chain; substitution of low-carbon product; low-carbon tax and subsidy toward supply chains.</p><p>Low-carbon supply chain is first of all a management problem (LCSCM, low-carbon supply chain management). Many studies use mathematical methods such as game theory to analyze the specific strategy adjustment and possible problems of enterprises introducing low-carbon supply chain, and put forward practical suggestions ([<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]). Awan [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>] highlighted the sustainability performance of manufacturer firms, for which social supply chain practices are of crucial meaning. He et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>] theoretically proved that the strategy of bilateral participation contract is more effective in dynamic cooperation to reduce carbon emissions by using the differential game method, because it can reduce the unfair distribution among the participants in the supply chain. There are also some enlightening studies on specific links and problems in the low-carbon supply chain. Zhang et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>] analyzed the content and importance of cooperation in the low-carbon supply chain and the equilibrium policy by using cooperative game. It is also suggested that the government should improve its position and strengthen public participation and supervision in the construction of low-carbon supply chain. Li and Shi [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>] proposed an effective scheme to measure the performance of low-carbon supply chain by using the method of combining the Balanced Scorecard and Data Envelopment Analysis. Tanimizu et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>] focused on the integrated production and low-carbon transportation links that play an important role in the operation of the low-carbon supply chain. Using the technical means of genetic algorithm, beam search and heuristic rule, they established a model that can minimize the carbon emissions in the production and transportation links, and verified the feasibility of the model with a simulation system. The summarizing and evaluating the development of low-carbon supply chain in specific countries had also attracted attention. Nishitani et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>] conducted an empirical study on 139 Japanese manufacturing companies in various fields, and proved that companies adopting low-carbon supply chain management mode perform better in carbon emission reduction. Gupta and Jayant [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>] surveyed many enterprises with questionnaires, and analyzed the results with a fuzzy DEMATE based technology, summarizing the main obstacles encountered by Indian enterprises in the process of developing low-carbon supply chain. The development and expansion of low-carbon product is the main direction of the low-carbon supply chain at the manufacturer’s end. Many scholars integrate the consideration of carbon footprint into the production model to obtain a low-carbon design scheme [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>]. He et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>] introduced the Lagrange relaxation-based method to track and control the carbon footprint of the low-carbon product during its whole life cycle. For manufacturers, cost control of low-carbon product is a key issue to be considered. The choice preference of consumers between low-carbon and high carbon product is also worthy of attention. It will affect the pricing, profit distribution and cost sharing of retailers and manufacturers [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>]. The model of Liu et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>] is based on the premise that consumers’ preference has to a large extent turned to low-carbon product. The higher price paid for low-carbon product makes retailers willing to share the cost of carbon emission reduction with manufacturers. Therefore, this cooperation within the low-carbon supply chain benefits both parties. Zhang et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>] conducted a two-level game considering the manufacturer’s strategy and the consumer’s preference, and obtained the equilibrium strategy of two-stage production, proposing a scheme that the manufacturer uses low-carbon raw materials in different stages to obtain the optimal retail price profit and the minimum carbon emission. In general, the researches on low-carbon supply chain focused mainly on discussing which innovations enterprises adopt in technology and management to achieve carbon emission reduction, and how to improve specific links such as production and transportation.</p><p>Since the development of e-commerce, dual channel supply chain had become a research hotspot in the academic community ([<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>]). Research on dual channel mainly focuses on price and profit optimization. Niu et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>] compared the retail price of traditional channel and dual channel. They found that in the case of lower logistics costs for online orders than traditional channel, if the manufacturer adopted a unified price for both online channel and traditional channel, the total order would decrease and the retail price would increase. Dai et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>] studied a dual channel supply chain decision making problem considering supply chain members in four information sharing scenarios, and analyzed the impacts of forecasting information on product quantity decisions and wholesale price decision. Ranjit et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>] analyzed the impact of decision maker changes on optimal prices and profits in dual supply chain, and the findings indicate that the optimal prices of the sequential game in the follower position would not exceed in the leader position. Wang et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>] analyzed the selling model selection problem of manufacturer in dual channel supply chain, and found that the manufacturer prefers direct selling mode when the direct operating cost redacted. Zhao et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>] established a dual channel supply chain consisting of multiple manufacturers and one retailer considering green promotion. The result demonstrated that green promotion could increase profits, and the increase in costs would have a greater impact on retailer profit than manufacturer profit. Huang et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>] studied the impact of countervailing incentives on dual channel supply chain decision making under asymmetric selling cost information. The research showed that, when the selling cost decrease, information asymmetry may affect channel efficiency in the dual-channel. We can see that, there are not many papers on dual channel supply chain considering multiple products with substitution relationship, especially related to the government’s low carbon policies.</p><p>The government has many policy means to promote the development of low carbon economy, such as tax cap, tax trade market, etc., among which carbon tax is a policy tool that has been used by some countries and has the advantage of low implementation cost. The carbon tax levied by the long supply chain network has a great impact on the production, transportation and sales of the supply chain. How to reconstruct the supply chain in the context of carbon tax and obtain the optimal benefits is a topic that needs the attention of the academic community. Alnourani and mejjaouli [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>] proved that the carbon tax has changed the behavior of the participants in the two level supply chain, affecting the selection of suppliers and the total cost, and suggested that the government consider the effect of the carbon tax on the supply chain network. Meng et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>] discussed the optimal strategy of product selection between two companies with competitive relationship under the conditions of Nash game and Stackelberg game respectively under different carbon tax rates. It was found that the two companies would choose the same product strategy in the Nash game and have nothing to do with carbon tax rates. In the Stackelberg game, however, they would adopt different product strategies on low carbon tax rates. Yang et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>] quantified and compared the impact of three different types of carbon tax policies on the supply chain network including multiple manufacturers and multiple demand markets, and obtained the differences of different tax rates in product trading volume, carbon tax and profits, as well as the impact on the decisions of supply chain participants and carbon emission reduction behaviors. In order to stimulate the development of low carbon supply chain, it is also a common policy means for the government to directly subsidize the participants and specific links. Zhang and Yu [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref038\" class=\"ref-tip\">38</a>] predicted from the altruistic perspective what behaviors of the manufacturer as the dominant party and the retailer as the subordinate party would do to realize carbon emission reduction and what influence that would bring to their profits when the government provided compound subsidies to the low carbon supply chain. They believed that the unilateral altruistic model of the manufacturer would bring the best results in social welfare and other aspects. Ma et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>] constructed the game characteristics and equilibrium policies of the three channel supply chain model under the background of carbon subsidy, and found that the supply chain system dominated by manufacturers was the most stable when the government implemented the duel carbon subsidy policy. Therefore, the government should consider the power structure of the supply chain market when determining a reasonable carbon subsidy rate. From the above researches we can summarize that carbon tax and subsidy are both powerful carbon emission reduction policy tools. However, the comparison among different policy tools and the joint use of two or more policy tools, of whether they will have the same or different impacts on the profits of manufacturers and retailers in the dual channel supply chain, as well as on the social welfare generated, and what role will each policy mode play in the selection of high carbon and low carbon product, are all subjects worthy of comparative study.</p><p>To sum up, the existing researches mainly focused on the management and decision making of all participants and links in the development of low carbon dual channel supply chain, especially on the design of low carbon product from the perspective of innovation and reformation. Some studies also introduced the factors that the government imposes carbon tax on high carbon product or subsidizes low carbon product to calculate their impact on the decision making among the dual channel supply chain. However, for the relationship between low carbon product and high carbon product that are substitutive with each other in terms of demand and profit, as well as the similarities and differences in the results brought about by the government’s low carbon subsidy and carbon tax measures, and even the effects of the two joint implemented, there is still a lack of research on integrating the above factors into the same model for calculation.</p><h2>3. Model description</h2><p>This study establishes a low carbon dual channel supply chain, including a manufacturer and a retailer, in which the manufacturer produces low carbon product and high carbon product at the same time. These two products have strong substitutability in their usable functions. In recent years, with the rapid development of e-commerce, online direct channels are increasingly favored by the market, and the proportion of direct sales of manufacturers’ products in the total sales is also increasing, which has an important impact on the traditional supply chain sales channels. Traditional high carbon product mostly chooses traditional channel, while low carbon product is a new phenomenon, which is suitable for using direct channels. In terms of high carbon product, the manufacturer and the retailer play a Stackelberg game, and the manufacturer is the leader. In terms of low carbon product, the manufacturer and the retailer are engaged in Nash competition, while the government is the leader in the Stackelberg game between manufacturer and retailer. In order to encourage consumers to purchase low carbon product, the government will provide subsidy to consumers who purchase low carbon product. At the same time, the government will impose carbon tax on manufacturer of high carbon product to reduce the product of high carbon product [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>].</p><p>Setting that the total market scale of low carbon product and high carbon product is <em>a</em>, and the proportion of consumers who prefer high carbon product in the total market is <em>h</em>.

Numerical analysis</h2><p>This section aims to test the conclusion of model deduction of the previous section through numerical calculation, and further analyzes the social welfare, manufacturer profit, retailer profit and other relevant parameters of the dual channel low carbon supply chain considering product substitution under the three modes of subsidy + carbon tax, subsidy only and carbon tax only. Since it is difficult to obtain actual data, this section makes relevant calculations through hypothetical and general data [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>].</p><p>Setting <em>a</em> = 380, <em>b</em><sub>1</sub> = 11, <em>b</em><sub>2</sub> = 9, <em>c</em> = 5.3, <em>v</em><sub>1</sub> = 3.8$, <em>m</em><sub>2</sub> = 0.4$, ε = 7.5, <em>r</em> = 60, <em>h</em> = 0.5, the specific parameter settings are as <a href=\"#pone-0287167-t003\">Table 3</a>:</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.t003\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.t003</a></p><p>It is shown in <a href=\"#pone-0287167-t003\">Table 3</a> that: social welfare is the largest under the subsidy + carbon tax mode, followed by the subsidy mode and the minimum under the carbon tax mode, verified the correctness of theorem 5. The manufacturer profit is the largest in the subsidy mode and the carbon tax mode is the smallest. However, the profit of retailer is the largest under the subsidy mode, followed by the subsidy + carbon tax mode, and the carbon tax mode is the smallest. The demand of high carbon product 1 is the largest under the subsidy mode, and the subsidy + carbon tax mode is equal to the carbon tax mode. The demand for low carbon product 2 is the largest under the subsidy + carbon tax mode, and the carbon tax mode is the smallest. The wholesale price and retail price of high carbon product 1 are the highest under the carbon tax mode, and the retail price of low carbon product 2 is the highest under the subsidy mode.</p><h3>5.1 Sensitivity analysis</h3><p>The main differences between low carbon product 2 and high carbon product 1 are reflected in environmental hazard and product cost, so we analyze the sensitivity of ε and <em>r</em>. The influence of <em>ε</em> on all the parameters under three modes are shown in <a href=\"#pone-0287167-t004\">Table 4</a>:</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.t004\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.t004</a></p><p>The increase of ε indicates the wholesale price increase of low carbon product 4. According to <a href=\"#pone-0287167-t003\">Table 3</a>, with the increase of <em>ε</em>, under subsidy + carbon tax mode <em>π</em><sub><em>r</em></sub> and <em>q</em><sub>1</sub> will increase and the following parameters will decrease: <em>π</em><sub><em>g</em></sub>, <em>π</em><sub><em>f</em></sub>, <em>q</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>w</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>τ</em>, <em>s</em>, with no influence on <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>. Under subsidy mode, <em>π</em><sub><em>r</em></sub>, <em>q</em><sub>1</sub>, and <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> will increase, <em>π</em><sub><em>g</em></sub>, <em>π</em><sub><em>f</em></sub>, <em>q</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>, and <em>s</em> will decrease, and <em>w</em><sub>1</sub> will not change. Under carbon tax mode, <em>π</em><sub><em>f</em></sub>, <em>π</em><sub><em>r</em></sub>, <em>q</em><sub>1</sub>, and <em>p</em><sub>2</sub> will increase while <em>π</em><sub><em>g</em></sub>, <em>q</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>w</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>τ</em> will decrease. It can be deducted that the increase of the cost of low carbon product 2 will lead to the rise of retailer profit and sales of high carbon product 1, while the government target and sales of low carbon product 2 will decrease. Because the increase of producing cost of low carbon product 2 causes the decrease of its demand, it will directly result in the decrease of retailer profit and government target. Due to the competitive relationship between high carbon product 1 and low carbon product 2, the sales of high carbon product 1 will increase.</p><p>The influence of <em>r</em> on all the parameters under three modes are shown in <a href=\"#pone-0287167-t005\">Table 5</a>:</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.t005\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.t005</a></p><p>The bigger the value of <em>r</em> is, the larger environmental hazard high carbon product 1 causes, and contrarily the environmental hazard created by low carbon product 2 is smaller. Under subsidy + carbon tax mode, <em>q</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>w</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>p</em><sub>1</sub>, and <em>τ</em> will increase, <em>π</em><sub><em>g</em></sub>, <em>π</em><sub><em>f</em></sub>, <em>π</em><sub><em>r</em></sub>, and <em>q</em><sub>1</sub> will decrease, verified the correctness of Theorem 4, and <em>p</em><sub>2</sub> and <em>s</em> receive no influence. Under subsidy mode, <em>π</em><sub><em>f</em></sub>, <em>q</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>, and <em>s</em> will increase, <em>π</em><sub><em>g</em></sub>, <em>π</em><sub><em>r</em></sub>, <em>q</em><sub>1</sub>, and <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> will decrease, and <em>w</em><sub>1</sub> doesn’t change. Under carbon tax mode, <em>q</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>w</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>p</em><sub>1</sub>, and <em>τ</em> will increase, <em>π</em><sub><em>g</em></sub>, <em>π</em><sub><em>f</em></sub>, <em>π</em><sub><em>r</em></sub>, and <em>q</em><sub>1</sub> will decrease, and <em>p</em><sub>2</sub> will stay unchanged. We can see that the increase of <em>r</em> causes the rise of sales of low carbon product 2 under all three modes as well as the decrease of manufacturer profit, government target and sales of high carbon product 1. Because of the increase of pollution from high carbon product 1, government will increase the tax levied on high carbon product 1, thus leading to smaller demand of products 1, then the decrease of manufacturer profit and government target.</p><h3>5.2 Dual channel analysis</h3><p>The manufacturer profit is the sum of the profit from selling high carbon product 1 through traditional channel and the profit from directly channel low carbon product 2. The main indicators that affect these two dual channels are the production cost of the low carbon product 2 and consumer product preferences. Therefore, this section mainly analyzes the impact of <em>ε</em> and <em>h</em> on manufacturer profit. Set <em>tradition</em> as profit from high carbon product 2 through traditional channel, <em>direct</em> as profit from low carbon product 1 through direct channel.</p><p>According to Figs <a href=\"#pone-0287167-g004\">4</a>, <a href=\"#pone-0287167-g005\">5</a>, <a href=\"#pone-0287167-g006\">6</a>, we can see that as the proportion of consumers who prefer high carbon products in the total market <em>h</em> increases, the profit brought to manufacturer by traditional channel for high carbon product 1 will significantly increase, while the profit brought to manufacturer by direct channel for low carbon products 2 reduce. And the increase in product cost of low carbon product 2 will also bring the same result. Therefore, in order to enhance the competitive advantage of low carbon product 2, manufacturer need to focus on the consumer preference for low carbon product 2.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.g004\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.g004</a></p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.g005\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.g005</a></p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.g006\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.g006</a></p><h2>6. Conclusion</h2><p>The core issue of supply chain management is product management. It needs a new sales channel for new product replacing old product in the market, and the dual channel provides the possibility of establishing the new sales channel. The purpose of product management is to meet consumer needs. With the strengthening of consumers’ awareness of environmental protection, low carbon products are becoming increasingly popular in the market, and government subsidy policy is further promoting consumers’ preference for low carbon products. Therefore, how to coordinate government, manufacturer, and retailer coordinate with each other to achieve maximum social performance, environmental performance, and economic benefits is a problem that needs to be solved. This research studies the impact of government carbon tax and low carbon subsidy on dual channel low carbon supply chain. We have built a two level dual channel supply chain, including a manufacturer and a retailer, in which the manufacturer produces both high carbon product through traditional channel and low carbon product through direct channel. The government subsidizes consumers who buy low carbon product and imposes carbon tax on manufacturers who produce high carbon product. We compare parameters such as the social welfare, manufacturer profit and retailer profit under the three modes of subsidy + carbon tax, subsidy only and carbon tax only. The purpose of this study is to provide effective suggestions for decision making among the government, manufacturer, and retailer, in order to achieve maximum social welfare, manufacturer profit, and retailer profit.</p><p>The findings of this study are as follows:</p><p>However, the research still has certain limitations. For example, only two products are considered, but in reality, there are always many products that have substitution relations. At the same time, there is only one retailer and one manufacturer in this model, while multiple manufacturers and retailers are more common. Future research can focus on the following aspects that can be expanded: on the one hand, we hope to study the substitution of multiple products inside a dual-channel low-carbon supply chain, and to compare the impact of the government’s carbon tax and subsidy policies on this supply chain; on the other hand, we are looking forward to considering a more complex dual channel low carbon supply chain system with multiple manufacturers and retailers, and analyze the impact of the government’s carbon tax and subsidy policies on the decisions and profits of manufacturers and retailers.</p><h2>Supporting information</h2><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.s001\">S1 Appendix. </a></h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.s001\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.s001</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(DOCX)</p><h2>References</h2><h3>Subject Areas <div id=\"subjInfo\">?</div>\\n    <div id=\"subjInfoText\">\\n      <p>For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/PLOS/plos-thesaurus/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link opens in new window\">here</a>.</p>\\n      <span class=\"inline-intro\">We want your feedback.</span> Do these Subject Areas make sense for this article?

This paper constructs a low-carbon dual channel supply chain composed of one manufacturer and one retailer. The manufacturer produces low-carbon product and high carbon product with substitution relationship. The retailer sells high carbon product in traditional channel. The manufacturer also sells low-carbon product in direct channel. The government, manufacturer and retailer conduct a three-level Stackelberg game. This paper studies the optimal decisions of the government, manufacturer and retailer under the three modes of carbon tax + subsidy, carbon tax only and subsidy only. It has been found that for social welfare, the carbon tax + subsidy model is higher than the subsidy model and carbon tax model. For manufacturer profit, the subsidy mode is the highest, followed by the carbon tax + subsidy mode. For retailer profit, the carbon tax + subsidy model is equal to the carbon tax model. The increase in the proportion of consumers who prefer high carbon product in the total market or product cost of low-carbon product, will increase the profit of traditional channel and reduce the profit of direct channel.</p><p><strong>Citation: </strong>Xu C, Tang X, Song J, Wang C (2023) Research on low-carbon dual channel supply chain considering product substitution under government carbon tax and low-carbon subsidy.

Introduction</h2><p>In the past two decades, the emission reduction of greenhouse gases, mainly represented by carbon dioxide, has become an increasingly concerned issue globally [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>]. The abnormal climate events all over the world in recent years have attracted people’s attention to the global warming phenomenon. The concept of low carbon has increasingly infiltrated into all aspects of society, especially in the economic field ([<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>]). As a major carbon emission country, China has put forward specific implementation plans such as \"Blue Sky Action\", made efforts in the emission of air pollutants and greenhouse gases, and made significant contributions to the improvement of the global atmospheric environment. In 2019, China further solemnly made a commitment to the \"double carbon\" goal to the world [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. The construction and management of low carbon supply chain is an important component and necessary means of low carbon economy development. The core of low carbon supply chain is to replace high carbon product with low carbon product. It requires cooperative efforts from manufacturers to retailers, and it is a long term and gradual process, because consumers also have their own buying habits and preferences.</p><p>With the rapid development of e-commerce, many enterprises choose the dual channel, such as Nike, Dell and Apple [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>]. Enterprises can reach more consumers through direct channel to achieve the goal of rapid product promotion. In practice, many manufacturers will choose traditional channel to sell products without technological innovation and direct channel sell products with new technologies to consumers [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>]. Traditional channel product and direct channel product usually have a certain degree of substitutability in terms of functionality, therefore the two products have market competition. It is very complicated for manufacturer to determine the channel strategy, as well as the selling prices of the two products. Manufacturers and retailers in the dual channel supply chain should take into account how to efficiently realize the comprehensive construction of the low carbon dual channel supply chain, and formulate reasonable wholesale and retail prices, coordinate sales channels for low carbon product and high carbon product. These are not only the heated issues in the current academic areas, but also the problem that practitioners of all the industrial sections should consider and solve [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. The development of low-carbon economy, especially the low carbon dual channel supply chain, should first be regulated by the government which plays a leading role, formulates corresponding laws and regulations, integrates and allocates social resources, as well as supports the development of low-carbon industry and the promotion of low-carbon technology [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. Government policies that have a direct impact on the low carbon supply chain mainly include carbon tax and low carbon subsidy. At present, carbon tax is chiefly levied in some developed countries and regions, mostly in Europe. And their experiences have proved that carbon tax levied on enterprises can reduce carbon emission and even change the consumption pattern of ordinary people, the impact of this measure on enterprises, environment and national competitiveness needs careful investigation and assessment ([<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>]). China is also actively preparing for the establishment of a carbon tax system. The special research panel on carbon tax led by the Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance has issued a research report, which analyzes the necessity and feasibility of levying carbon tax in terms of theory, policy and technology, and puts forward the basic objectives and principles of levying carbon tax in China [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>]. On the other hand, government subsidy for low-carbon supply chain can also encourage enterprises to optimize the construction of green supply chain and play an incentive role in carbon emission reduction. For example, &lt;Interim Measures for the Administration of Subsidies for Energy Conservation and Emission reduction&gt; (2015) issued by the Ministry of Finance of China aims to encourage enterprises to increase investment in energy conservation and emission reduction by using subsidy policies [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>]. In addition, the government’s low carbon subsidy to consumers buying low carbon product will also change people’s purchase choices of products and accelerate the substitution of low carbon product [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>].</p><p>Under such background, we propose the following questions:</p><p>The remaining of the paper is arranged as the following sections: Section 2 reviews the previous research literatures, summarizes their main directions as well as shortcomings, and points out the gaps to be filled in this study. Section 3 is the introduction of the research model, which describes the dual channel supply chain model considering the substitution of high carbon and low carbon product established in this study, and the definition of the parameters in the model. Section 4 calculates the performance of the above supply chain model under the three modes of subsidy, carbon tax and subsidy + carbon tax, focused on performance of parameters such as product demand, manufacturer profit, retailer profit and social welfare. Section 5 is a numerical example analysis, bringing in specific values from real cases to further test the numerical performance of each parameter of the supply chain considering the two products under the three modes. Section 6 is the conclusion, which summarizes the main findings and significance of this study, reviews existing defects to be further improved, and makes a prospect for future research.</p><h2>2. Literature review</h2><p>To construct low-carbon supply chain and promote it to replace the traditional high-energy-consuming supply chain forms, theoretical researches should be carried out concerning all the aspects in low-carbon supply chain development. In this section we have a review about the literatures falling into three topics: low-carbon supply chain; substitution of low-carbon product; low-carbon tax and subsidy toward supply chains.</p><p>Low-carbon supply chain is first of all a management problem (LCSCM, low-carbon supply chain management). Many studies use mathematical methods such as game theory to analyze the specific strategy adjustment and possible problems of enterprises introducing low-carbon supply chain, and put forward practical suggestions ([<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]). Awan [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>] highlighted the sustainability performance of manufacturer firms, for which social supply chain practices are of crucial meaning. He et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>] theoretically proved that the strategy of bilateral participation contract is more effective in dynamic cooperation to reduce carbon emissions by using the differential game method, because it can reduce the unfair distribution among the participants in the supply chain. There are also some enlightening studies on specific links and problems in the low-carbon supply chain. Zhang et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>] analyzed the content and importance of cooperation in the low-carbon supply chain and the equilibrium policy by using cooperative game. It is also suggested that the government should improve its position and strengthen public participation and supervision in the construction of low-carbon supply chain. Li and Shi [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>] proposed an effective scheme to measure the performance of low-carbon supply chain by using the method of combining the Balanced Scorecard and Data Envelopment Analysis. Tanimizu et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>] focused on the integrated production and low-carbon transportation links that play an important role in the operation of the low-carbon supply chain. Using the technical means of genetic algorithm, beam search and heuristic rule, they established a model that can minimize the carbon emissions in the production and transportation links, and verified the feasibility of the model with a simulation system. The summarizing and evaluating the development of low-carbon supply chain in specific countries had also attracted attention. Nishitani et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>] conducted an empirical study on 139 Japanese manufacturing companies in various fields, and proved that companies adopting low-carbon supply chain management mode perform better in carbon emission reduction. Gupta and Jayant [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>] surveyed many enterprises with questionnaires, and analyzed the results with a fuzzy DEMATE based technology, summarizing the main obstacles encountered by Indian enterprises in the process of developing low-carbon supply chain. The development and expansion of low-carbon product is the main direction of the low-carbon supply chain at the manufacturer’s end. Many scholars integrate the consideration of carbon footprint into the production model to obtain a low-carbon design scheme [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>]. He et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>] introduced the Lagrange relaxation-based method to track and control the carbon footprint of the low-carbon product during its whole life cycle. For manufacturers, cost control of low-carbon product is a key issue to be considered. The choice preference of consumers between low-carbon and high carbon product is also worthy of attention. It will affect the pricing, profit distribution and cost sharing of retailers and manufacturers [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>]. The model of Liu et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>] is based on the premise that consumers’ preference has to a large extent turned to low-carbon product. The higher price paid for low-carbon product makes retailers willing to share the cost of carbon emission reduction with manufacturers. Therefore, this cooperation within the low-carbon supply chain benefits both parties. Zhang et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>] conducted a two-level game considering the manufacturer’s strategy and the consumer’s preference, and obtained the equilibrium strategy of two-stage production, proposing a scheme that the manufacturer uses low-carbon raw materials in different stages to obtain the optimal retail price profit and the minimum carbon emission. In general, the researches on low-carbon supply chain focused mainly on discussing which innovations enterprises adopt in technology and management to achieve carbon emission reduction, and how to improve specific links such as production and transportation.</p><p>Since the development of e-commerce, dual channel supply chain had become a research hotspot in the academic community ([<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>]). Research on dual channel mainly focuses on price and profit optimization. Niu et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>] compared the retail price of traditional channel and dual channel. They found that in the case of lower logistics costs for online orders than traditional channel, if the manufacturer adopted a unified price for both online channel and traditional channel, the total order would decrease and the retail price would increase. Dai et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>] studied a dual channel supply chain decision making problem considering supply chain members in four information sharing scenarios, and analyzed the impacts of forecasting information on product quantity decisions and wholesale price decision. Ranjit et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>] analyzed the impact of decision maker changes on optimal prices and profits in dual supply chain, and the findings indicate that the optimal prices of the sequential game in the follower position would not exceed in the leader position. Wang et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>] analyzed the selling model selection problem of manufacturer in dual channel supply chain, and found that the manufacturer prefers direct selling mode when the direct operating cost redacted. Zhao et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>] established a dual channel supply chain consisting of multiple manufacturers and one retailer considering green promotion. The result demonstrated that green promotion could increase profits, and the increase in costs would have a greater impact on retailer profit than manufacturer profit. Huang et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>] studied the impact of countervailing incentives on dual channel supply chain decision making under asymmetric selling cost information. The research showed that, when the selling cost decrease, information asymmetry may affect channel efficiency in the dual-channel. We can see that, there are not many papers on dual channel supply chain considering multiple products with substitution relationship, especially related to the government’s low carbon policies.</p><p>The government has many policy means to promote the development of low carbon economy, such as tax cap, tax trade market, etc., among which carbon tax is a policy tool that has been used by some countries and has the advantage of low implementation cost. The carbon tax levied by the long supply chain network has a great impact on the production, transportation and sales of the supply chain. How to reconstruct the supply chain in the context of carbon tax and obtain the optimal benefits is a topic that needs the attention of the academic community. Alnourani and mejjaouli [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>] proved that the carbon tax has changed the behavior of the participants in the two level supply chain, affecting the selection of suppliers and the total cost, and suggested that the government consider the effect of the carbon tax on the supply chain network. Meng et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>] discussed the optimal strategy of product selection between two companies with competitive relationship under the conditions of Nash game and Stackelberg game respectively under different carbon tax rates. It was found that the two companies would choose the same product strategy in the Nash game and have nothing to do with carbon tax rates. In the Stackelberg game, however, they would adopt different product strategies on low carbon tax rates. Yang et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>] quantified and compared the impact of three different types of carbon tax policies on the supply chain network including multiple manufacturers and multiple demand markets, and obtained the differences of different tax rates in product trading volume, carbon tax and profits, as well as the impact on the decisions of supply chain participants and carbon emission reduction behaviors. In order to stimulate the development of low carbon supply chain, it is also a common policy means for the government to directly subsidize the participants and specific links. Zhang and Yu [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref038\" class=\"ref-tip\">38</a>] predicted from the altruistic perspective what behaviors of the manufacturer as the dominant party and the retailer as the subordinate party would do to realize carbon emission reduction and what influence that would bring to their profits when the government provided compound subsidies to the low carbon supply chain. They believed that the unilateral altruistic model of the manufacturer would bring the best results in social welfare and other aspects. Ma et al. [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>] constructed the game characteristics and equilibrium policies of the three channel supply chain model under the background of carbon subsidy, and found that the supply chain system dominated by manufacturers was the most stable when the government implemented the duel carbon subsidy policy. Therefore, the government should consider the power structure of the supply chain market when determining a reasonable carbon subsidy rate. From the above researches we can summarize that carbon tax and subsidy are both powerful carbon emission reduction policy tools. However, the comparison among different policy tools and the joint use of two or more policy tools, of whether they will have the same or different impacts on the profits of manufacturers and retailers in the dual channel supply chain, as well as on the social welfare generated, and what role will each policy mode play in the selection of high carbon and low carbon product, are all subjects worthy of comparative study.</p><p>To sum up, the existing researches mainly focused on the management and decision making of all participants and links in the development of low carbon dual channel supply chain, especially on the design of low carbon product from the perspective of innovation and reformation. Some studies also introduced the factors that the government imposes carbon tax on high carbon product or subsidizes low carbon product to calculate their impact on the decision making among the dual channel supply chain. However, for the relationship between low carbon product and high carbon product that are substitutive with each other in terms of demand and profit, as well as the similarities and differences in the results brought about by the government’s low carbon subsidy and carbon tax measures, and even the effects of the two joint implemented, there is still a lack of research on integrating the above factors into the same model for calculation.</p><h2>3. Model description</h2><p>This study establishes a low carbon dual channel supply chain, including a manufacturer and a retailer, in which the manufacturer produces low carbon product and high carbon product at the same time. These two products have strong substitutability in their usable functions. In recent years, with the rapid development of e-commerce, online direct channels are increasingly favored by the market, and the proportion of direct sales of manufacturers’ products in the total sales is also increasing, which has an important impact on the traditional supply chain sales channels. Traditional high carbon product mostly chooses traditional channel, while low carbon product is a new phenomenon, which is suitable for using direct channels. In terms of high carbon product, the manufacturer and the retailer play a Stackelberg game, and the manufacturer is the leader. In terms of low carbon product, the manufacturer and the retailer are engaged in Nash competition, while the government is the leader in the Stackelberg game between manufacturer and retailer. In order to encourage consumers to purchase low carbon product, the government will provide subsidy to consumers who purchase low carbon product. At the same time, the government will impose carbon tax on manufacturer of high carbon product to reduce the product of high carbon product [<a href=\"#pone.0287167.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>].</p><p>Setting that the total market scale of low carbon product and high carbon product is <em>a</em>, and the proportion of consumers who prefer high carbon product in the total market is <em>h</em>. The production cost of low carbon product is ε times that of high carbon product. The carbon emission of low carbon product is 1/<em>r</em> of high carbon product. The parameters in the model are shown in <a href=\"#pone-0287167-t001\">Table 1</a>:</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.t001</a></p><p>Since consumers who buy low carbon product can directly receive subsidy from the government, it is equivalent to that the retail price of low carbon product 2 decreases from <em>p</em><sub>2</sub> to <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>−<em>s</em>.

Dual channel supply chain decision model analysis under three modes</h2><h3>4.1 Decision of dual channel supply chain under carbon tax + subsidy mode</h3><p>In the dual channel supply chain, we assume that high carbon product is sold by the retailer and low carbon product is directly sold by the manufacturer.

The influence of <em>ε</em> on all the parameters under three modes are shown in <a href=\"#pone-0287167-t004\">Table 4</a>:</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.t004\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.t004</a></p><p>The increase of ε indicates the wholesale price increase of low carbon product 4. According to <a href=\"#pone-0287167-t003\">Table 3</a>, with the increase of <em>ε</em>, under subsidy + carbon tax mode <em>π</em><sub><em>r</em></sub> and <em>q</em><sub>1</sub> will increase and the following parameters will decrease: <em>π</em><sub><em>g</em></sub>, <em>π</em><sub><em>f</em></sub>, <em>q</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>w</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>τ</em>, <em>s</em>, with no influence on <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>. Under subsidy mode, <em>π</em><sub><em>r</em></sub>, <em>q</em><sub>1</sub>, and <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> will increase, <em>π</em><sub><em>g</em></sub>, <em>π</em><sub><em>f</em></sub>, <em>q</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>, and <em>s</em> will decrease, and <em>w</em><sub>1</sub> will not change. Under carbon tax mode, <em>π</em><sub><em>f</em></sub>, <em>π</em><sub><em>r</em></sub>, <em>q</em><sub>1</sub>, and <em>p</em><sub>2</sub> will increase while <em>π</em><sub><em>g</em></sub>, <em>q</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>w</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>τ</em> will decrease. It can be deducted that the increase of the cost of low carbon product 2 will lead to the rise of retailer profit and sales of high carbon product 1, while the government target and sales of low carbon product 2 will decrease. Because the increase of producing cost of low carbon product 2 causes the decrease of its demand, it will directly result in the decrease of retailer profit and government target. Due to the competitive relationship between high carbon product 1 and low carbon product 2, the sales of high carbon product 1 will increase.</p><p>The influence of <em>r</em> on all the parameters under three modes are shown in <a href=\"#pone-0287167-t005\">Table 5</a>:</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.t005\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.t005</a></p><p>The bigger the value of <em>r</em> is, the larger environmental hazard high carbon product 1 causes, and contrarily the environmental hazard created by low carbon product 2 is smaller. Under subsidy + carbon tax mode, <em>q</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>w</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>p</em><sub>1</sub>, and <em>τ</em> will increase, <em>π</em><sub><em>g</em></sub>, <em>π</em><sub><em>f</em></sub>, <em>π</em><sub><em>r</em></sub>, and <em>q</em><sub>1</sub> will decrease, verified the correctness of Theorem 4, and <em>p</em><sub>2</sub> and <em>s</em> receive no influence. Under subsidy mode, <em>π</em><sub><em>f</em></sub>, <em>q</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>, and <em>s</em> will increase, <em>π</em><sub><em>g</em></sub>, <em>π</em><sub><em>r</em></sub>, <em>q</em><sub>1</sub>, and <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> will decrease, and <em>w</em><sub>1</sub> doesn’t change. Under carbon tax mode, <em>q</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>w</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>p</em><sub>1</sub>, and <em>τ</em> will increase, <em>π</em><sub><em>g</em></sub>, <em>π</em><sub><em>f</em></sub>, <em>π</em><sub><em>r</em></sub>, and <em>q</em><sub>1</sub> will decrease, and <em>p</em><sub>2</sub> will stay unchanged. We can see that the increase of <em>r</em> causes the rise of sales of low carbon product 2 under all three modes as well as the decrease of manufacturer profit, government target and sales of high carbon product 1. Because of the increase of pollution from high carbon product 1, government will increase the tax levied on high carbon product 1, thus leading to smaller demand of products 1, then the decrease of manufacturer profit and government target.</p><h3>5.2 Dual channel analysis</h3><p>The manufacturer profit is the sum of the profit from selling high carbon product 1 through traditional channel and the profit from directly channel low carbon product 2. The main indicators that affect these two dual channels are the production cost of the low carbon product 2 and consumer product preferences. Therefore, this section mainly analyzes the impact of <em>ε</em> and <em>h</em> on manufacturer profit. Set <em>tradition</em> as profit from high carbon product 2 through traditional channel, <em>direct</em> as profit from low carbon product 1 through direct channel.</p><p>According to Figs <a href=\"#pone-0287167-g004\">4</a>, <a href=\"#pone-0287167-g005\">5</a>, <a href=\"#pone-0287167-g006\">6</a>, we can see that as the proportion of consumers who prefer high carbon products in the total market <em>h</em> increases, the profit brought to manufacturer by traditional channel for high carbon product 1 will significantly increase, while the profit brought to manufacturer by direct channel for low carbon products 2 reduce. And the increase in product cost of low carbon product 2 will also bring the same result. Therefore, in order to enhance the competitive advantage of low carbon product 2, manufacturer need to focus on the consumer preference for low carbon product 2.</p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.g004\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.g004</a></p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.g005\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.g005</a></p><p class=\"caption_target\"></p><p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.g006\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.g006</a></p><h2>6. Conclusion</h2><p>The core issue of supply chain management is product management. It needs a new sales channel for new product replacing old product in the market, and the dual channel provides the possibility of establishing the new sales channel. The purpose of product management is to meet consumer needs. With the strengthening of consumers’ awareness of environmental protection, low carbon products are becoming increasingly popular in the market, and government subsidy policy is further promoting consumers’ preference for low carbon products. Therefore, how to coordinate government, manufacturer, and retailer coordinate with each other to achieve maximum social performance, environmental performance, and economic benefits is a problem that needs to be solved. This research studies the impact of government carbon tax and low carbon subsidy on dual channel low carbon supply chain. We have built a two level dual channel supply chain, including a manufacturer and a retailer, in which the manufacturer produces both high carbon product through traditional channel and low carbon product through direct channel. The government subsidizes consumers who buy low carbon product and imposes carbon tax on manufacturers who produce high carbon product. We compare parameters such as the social welfare, manufacturer profit and retailer profit under the three modes of subsidy + carbon tax, subsidy only and carbon tax only. The purpose of this study is to provide effective suggestions for decision making among the government, manufacturer, and retailer, in order to achieve maximum social welfare, manufacturer profit, and retailer profit.</p><p>The findings of this study are as follows:</p><p>However, the research still has certain limitations. For example, only two products are considered, but in reality, there are always many products that have substitution relations. At the same time, there is only one retailer and one manufacturer in this model, while multiple manufacturers and retailers are more common. Future research can focus on the following aspects that can be expanded: on the one hand, we hope to study the substitution of multiple products inside a dual-channel low-carbon supply chain, and to compare the impact of the government’s carbon tax and subsidy policies on this supply chain; on the other hand, we are looking forward to considering a more complex dual channel low carbon supply chain system with multiple manufacturers and retailers, and analyze the impact of the government’s carbon tax and subsidy policies on the decisions and profits of manufacturers and retailers.</p><h2>Supporting information</h2><h3 class=\"siTitle title-small\"><a href=\"article/file?type=supplementary&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.s001\">S1 Appendix. </a></h3><p class=\"siDoi\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.s001\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287167.s001</a></p><p class=\"postSiDOI\">(DOCX)</p><h2>References</h2><h3>Subject Areas <div id=\"subjInfo\">?</div>\\n    <div id=\"subjInfoText\">\\n      <p>For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/PLOS/plos-thesaurus/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link opens in new window\">here</a>.</p>\\n      <span class=\"inline-intro\">We want your feedback.</span> Do these Subject Areas make sense for this article?

      "<p>Among individuals ≥ 65 years old, aortic stenosis is highly prevalent and the number of cases is expected to increase in the coming decades, due to the increased life expectancy.

      "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n",
      "<p>Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common surgically managed valvular heart disease and the third most common cardiovascular disease in Western countries [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>]. In our regional setting, prevalence in individuals ≥ 65 years is 3%, but increases exponentially with age to reach 7.4% in people &gt; 85 years [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. As life expectancy rises, it is estimated that case numbers in people &gt; 70 years of age will double or triple in the coming decades [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>].</p>\n",
      "<p>Severe AS, if untreated, is associated with high mortality [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. In the absence of useful pharmacological treatments, the only effective treatments are aortic valve replacement (AVR) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. The therapeutic decision should take into account the clinical characteristics of the patient, the feasibility of the intervention, local experience and outcomes, and the individualized surgical risk and likelihood that the intervention will improve survival and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>].</p>\n",
      "<p>Quality of life (QoL) can be defined as a multidimensional element that includes physical, psychological, cognitive, and social factors that affect how a person performs their activities and self-perceived degree of well-being [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>]. QoL assessments monitor the impact of a disease (and/or treatment) on a patient’s personal and social performance and are widely used in clinical practice, and SF-12 is one of the most widely used instruments [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. This questionnaire provides a generic measurement of general health and well-being and summarizes physical and mental components in 12 items divided into 8 health domains [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>].</p>\n",
      "<p>Knowledge of the impact of AS on patients’ QoL in the population setting is still scant. Few studies evaluate QoL in patients with symptomatic severe AS, and these are mostly limited to assessing QoL after surgery (AVR or TAVI) or in patients receiving palliative treatment in whom surgical intervention has been ruled out. Only 1 study in the Netherlands reported that QoL is lower in patients with symptomatic AS [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>], but no studies have been conducted on the impact of AS on QoL in the Spanish population. Since the onset of AS symptoms is progressive but slow [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>], and patients are elderly with associated comorbidities [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>], this could lead to overlook the impact of AS on QoL and the need of surgery. As per current guidelines, patient-related QoL should be considered during the decision on the best treatment option [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. Indeed, assessing patients’ QoL can promote and provide evidence for patient-centered care [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>].</p>\n",
      "<p>The aim of this study was to assess the impact of symptomatic severe AS on QoL in patients &gt; 65 years, compared to a control group in the same primary care setting, taking into account all cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and associated comorbidities.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Materials and methods</h2>\n",
      "<p>An observational epidemiological case-control study was conducted in a province of Spain between February 2014 and April 2018.</p>\n",
      "<p>Cases had symptomatic severe AS according to the criteria established by European Society of Cardiology guidelines currently available at the time of patients’ recruitment [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>], and were &gt; 65 years. Controls, without known AS, were recruited from the same primary care center as the cases and matched by age (± 5 years) and sex, in a 1:3 ratio. The absolute number of years (± 5) for matching is considered to be high, and was taken into account in logistic regression models to neutralize this potential confounding factor.</p>\n",
      "<p>Clinical and demographic data were prospectively obtained from patient interviews, physical examination, and consultation of medical records. Data collection, storage, and analysis were carried out according to applicable regulations. The patients gave written informed consent and the study was approved by our Hospital Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CREC) (20/2013) and the participating CREC of the Primary Care Research Institute (P16/132). A comprehensive description of study design, inclusion of cases and controls, and sample size determination can be found elsewhere [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>].</p>\n",
      "<p>Study participants completed the SF-12v2 HRQoL questionnaire. It summarizes the physical and mental components for 12 items across 8 health domains: physical functioning (2 items), role limitations due to physical problems (2 items), bodily pain (1 item), general health (1 item), vitality (1 item), social functioning (1 item), role limitations due to emotional problems (2 items), and mental health (2 items). A non-commercial version of this questionnaire was used, under license number QM021812. The questionnaire responses were interpreted using an algorithm that determines a summary assessment for the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and another for the Mental Component Summary (MCS) dimension from the responses for each item.</p>\n",
      "<p>Continuous variables were characterized using mean and standard deviation, and categorical variables with absolute and relative frequencies. A multiple logistic regression model was constructed to evaluate the QoL in severe AS patients, adjusted for any variables that were significant in the baseline model. Statistical methods were conducted as previously reported [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. Briefly, a two-step approach was used. First, potential confounding variables (CVRF, comorbidities) were analyzed at a baseline model. All variables with a p-value &lt;0.2 were selected and their input was carried out using forward and backward variable selection algorithms. Next, the model was readjusted testing those factors that remained in the limit area of p &lt;0.1. Final model was adjusted by age, sex and all significantly associated comorbidities and CVRF.</p>\n",
      "<p>The strength of the association of the 8 dimensions of the SF-12 questionnaire with the dependent variable was studied using the crude odds ratio with its 95% confidence interval (CI). The independent involvement of each dimension of the questionnaire with severe AS was estimated with the adjusted odds ratio (aOR), where the dependent variable was case/control and the independent variables were the results of the QoL test. Finally, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated to determine the sensitivity of the models created. All analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical package 15.0 and R, and significance level was set at 0.05.</p>\n",

      "<h3>Patient characteristics</h3>\n",
      "<p>A total of 102 cases and 221 controls were included in this study. For each case, between 1 and 3 controls from the same primary care center were included, matched by sex and age. An average of 2.17 controls was obtained for each case. The mean age of cases was significantly higher than in controls (77.6 years vs. 75.5 years, p = 0.003) (<a href=\"#pone-0287508-t001\">Table 1</a>), so the variable “age” was taken into account in regression models to avoid the confounding effect. No significant differences were found with regard to sex or other anthropometric variables, except in waist circumference and the presence of central obesity (<a href=\"#pone-0287508-t001\">Table 1</a>).

      "<p>Next, we adjusted our model for all CVFR and comorbidities significantly associated with severe symptomatic AS. The association between each dimension of QoL and symptomatic severe AS was still significant when adjusted for CVRFs and comorbidities (p &lt;0.001) (<a href=\"#pone-0287508-t002\">Table 2</a>). The area under the ROC curve showed good discrimination and predictive ability of association in all cases (ROC 0.82 to 0.87) (<a href=\"#pone-0287508-t002\">Table 2</a>).</p>\n",

A statistically significant inverse association was observed between the physical function and social function dimensions (p = 0.002 and p = 0.005) and an A multiple logistic regression model was constructed to evaluate the QoL in severe AS patients, adjusted for any variables that were significant in the baseline model inverse association close to significance (p = 0.052) was found between the physical role and severe AS (<a href=\"#pone-0287508-t003\">Table 3</a>).

      "<h2>Discussion</h2>\n",
      "<p>There is a clear association between symptomatic severe AS and lower self-reported perception of QoL. In this study, patients with AS scored lower than controls in all QoL domains of the SF-12 questionnaire, also when adjusted for CVRF and comorbidities. In the final multiple logistic regression model, we observed a significant association between physical function and social function and AS and an almost statistically significant association with physical role after controlling for other CVRF and comorbidities.</p>\n",
      "<p>Several tools are available for assessing QoL in the general population and in patients with specific chronic diseases. Disease-specific QoL scales focus on areas of life most affected by the disease and therefore have a higher sensitivity and specificity than general scales. However, the advantage of generic QoL instruments is that they can be used in different types of patients and populations and they can compare the relative impact of different diseases and obtain reference population values. Since no specific QoL scales for AS were available at the moment of initiation of the study, the generic SF-12 questionnaire was used in this study.</p>\n",
      "<p>The SF-12 questionnaire measures general health and well-being and covers 8 domains: physical function, which addresses limitations in daily life due to health problems; physical role limitations due to physical problems; bodily pain, which evaluates the frequency of the pain and how it interferes on an individual level; overall health, which measures the individual’s perception of their general health status; vitality, which assesses energy and fatigue levels; social function, which measures the extent to which health status interferes with social activities; limitations in emotional role activities due to emotional problems; and mental health measured by psychological distress [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. The results of this study show that severe AS affects all dimensions of patients’ QoL.</p>\n",
      "<p>Published data on the impact of AS on patients’ QoL are scarce. In fact, only one study comparing the QoL of patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic severe AS with the general population in 3 age groups (41–60 years, 61–70 years, and &gt; 70 years) has been conducted. This study found that QoL is lower in patients with symptomatic AS [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. Our results are in line with these data and show that the QoL of patients ≥ 65 years with symptomatic severe AS is lower than that of controls. In contrast with van Geldorp <em>et al</em>., after adjusting for CVRF and comorbidities, only two SF-12 questionnaire dimensions were associated with AS (physical function and social function) and one, almost statistically significant, was considered clinically relevant (physical role). These associations could help identify QoL issues in patients who have few symptoms and, despite recommendation in current guidelines, are not referred for intervention.</p>\n",
      "<p>A lower self-perceived QoL appears to have no correlation with disease severity. According to van Geldorp <em>et al</em>., there is no relationship between the degree of stenosis and the PCS and MCS scores of the SF-36v2 questionnaire. However, QoL does correlate with symptoms, since asymptomatic patients report a QoL similar to that of the general population [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. Although everything points in this direction, it is not known whether the severity of symptoms is negatively correlated with self-perceived QoL, or what the specific weight of each symptom in the impact of AS on QoL might be. This is a question that should be investigated in prospective studies in the future.</p>\n",
      "<p>In recent years, the study of QoL in patients with severe AS has focused on evaluating improvement after an intervention (AVR and/or TAVI), or on assessing the QoL of patients receiving palliative medical treatment in whom any intervention has been ruled out [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>]. HRQoL should also be taken into account when assessing health status and may be a useful parameter in the therapeutic decision-making process [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>].</p>\n",
      "<p>Current guidelines recommend earlier intervention in patients with severe AS, in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. Compared to conservative treatment, surgical intervention improves prognostic of these patients. Despite these recommendations, between 30% and 60% of patients are still not referred for aortic valve replacement surgery [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. Underestimation of the impact of aortic stenosis symptoms on quality of life may be one of the reasons of underestimation of surgical need in both types of patients. In this way, questionnaires such as SF-12 or EQ-5D may provide a quality of life measure that would complement the clinical data of patients and contribute to the improvement of therapeutic decisions [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>]. Given the differences observed in 3 of the SF-12 questionnaire dimensions (physical function, social function, and physical role), special attention to these items might mean that patients not otherwise considered for referral could be offered intervention [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>].</p>\n",
      "<p>This study has some limitations. Some cases who were potential candidates to participate may have died, which could mean that cases that were included had a better prognosis, bolstering the positive value of the results obtained. Likewise, controls may have been potential undiagnosed cases, since AS may not have clinical manifestations, even at advanced stages. This assumption would also further strengthen the results. With regard to sample size, 3 controls could not be selected for some cases, so the final sample size was slightly smaller than planned (221 instead of 261), thus decreasing the precision and statistical power. Despite matching by age, cases were older than controls due to the wide range used for matching (± 5 years), but age was taken into account in all regression models used. The effect of the other major CVRF and comorbidities on the QoL of cases and controls was taken into account in the regression models, but some residual confounding effect cannot be ruled out. The fact that the study was limited to people over 65 years could influence the magnitude of the association of QoL and severe AS. Finally, the results may not be applicable to other geographic areas.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n",
      "<p>Individuals ≥ 65 years with symptomatic severe AS score worse in the 8 health dimensions and PCS and MCS of the SF-12 health questionnaire than paired controls. In the multiple logistic regression models, all SF-12 dimensions and summary components are inversely associated with symptomatic severe AS in people ≥ 65 years. In the final regression model, an inverse association between the physical function and social function dimensions of the SF-12 questionnaire is observed in severe AS. In all cases, the discriminative and predictive ability of the association of the SF-12 questionnaire dimensions with severe AS was good. The use of quality-of-life scales provides evidence for patient‐centered care and could improve the management of severe AS, reduce delayed referral and improve patients’ QoL.</p>\n",

In our regional setting, prevalence in individuals ≥ 65 years is 3%, but increases exponentially with age to reach 7.4% in people &gt; 85 years [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. As life expectancy rises, it is estimated that case numbers in people &gt; 70 years of age will double or triple in the coming decades [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>].</p>\\n<p>Severe AS, if untreated, is associated with high mortality [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. In the absence of useful pharmacological treatments, the only effective treatments are aortic valve replacement (AVR) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. The therapeutic decision should take into account the clinical characteristics of the patient, the feasibility of the intervention, local experience and outcomes, and the individualized surgical risk and likelihood that the intervention will improve survival and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>].</p>\\n<p>Quality of life (QoL) can be defined as a multidimensional element that includes physical, psychological, cognitive, and social factors that affect how a person performs their activities and self-perceived degree of well-being [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>]. QoL assessments monitor the impact of a disease (and/or treatment) on a patient’s personal and social performance and are widely used in clinical practice, and SF-12 is one of the most widely used instruments [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. This questionnaire provides a generic measurement of general health and well-being and summarizes physical and mental components in 12 items divided into 8 health domains [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>].</p>\\n<p>Knowledge of the impact of AS on patients’ QoL in the population setting is still scant. Few studies evaluate QoL in patients with symptomatic severe AS, and these are mostly limited to assessing QoL after surgery (AVR or TAVI) or in patients receiving palliative treatment in whom surgical intervention has been ruled out. Only 1 study in the Netherlands reported that QoL is lower in patients with symptomatic AS [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>], but no studies have been conducted on the impact of AS on QoL in the Spanish population. Since the onset of AS symptoms is progressive but slow [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>], and patients are elderly with associated comorbidities [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>], this could lead to overlook the impact of AS on QoL and the need of surgery. As per current guidelines, patient-related QoL should be considered during the decision on the best treatment option [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. Indeed, assessing patients’ QoL can promote and provide evidence for patient-centered care [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>].</p>\\n<p>The aim of this study was to assess the impact of symptomatic severe AS on QoL in patients &gt; 65 years, compared to a control group in the same primary care setting, taking into account all cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and associated comorbidities.</p>\\n<h2>Materials and methods</h2>\\n<p>An observational epidemiological case-control study was conducted in a province of Spain between February 2014 and April 2018.</p>\\n<p>Cases had symptomatic severe AS according to the criteria established by European Society of Cardiology guidelines currently available at the time of patients’ recruitment [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>], and were &gt; 65 years. Controls, without known AS, were recruited from the same primary care center as the cases and matched by age (± 5 years) and sex, in a 1:3 ratio. The absolute number of years (± 5) for matching is considered to be high, and was taken into account in logistic regression models to neutralize this potential confounding factor.</p>\\n<p>Clinical and demographic data were prospectively obtained from patient interviews, physical examination, and consultation of medical records. Data collection, storage, and analysis were carried out according to applicable regulations. The patients gave written informed consent and the study was approved by our Hospital Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CREC) (20/2013) and the participating CREC of the Primary Care Research Institute (P16/132). A comprehensive description of study design, inclusion of cases and controls, and sample size determination can be found elsewhere [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>].</p>\\n<p>Study participants completed the SF-12v2 HRQoL questionnaire. It summarizes the physical and mental components for 12 items across 8 health domains: physical functioning (2 items), role limitations due to physical problems (2 items), bodily pain (1 item), general health (1 item), vitality (1 item), social functioning (1 item), role limitations due to emotional problems (2 items), and mental health (2 items). A non-commercial version of this questionnaire was used, under license number QM021812. The questionnaire responses were interpreted using an algorithm that determines a summary assessment for the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and another for the Mental Component Summary (MCS) dimension from the responses for each item.</p>\\n<p>Continuous variables were characterized using mean and standard deviation, and categorical variables with absolute and relative frequencies. A multiple logistic regression model was constructed to evaluate the QoL in severe AS patients, adjusted for any variables that were significant in the baseline model. Statistical methods were conducted as previously reported [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. Briefly, a two-step approach was used. First, potential confounding variables (CVRF, comorbidities) were analyzed at a baseline model. All variables with a p-value &lt;0.2 were selected and their input was carried out using forward and backward variable selection algorithms. Next, the model was readjusted testing those factors that remained in the limit area of p &lt;0.1. Final model was adjusted by age, sex and all significantly associated comorbidities and CVRF.</p>\\n<p>The strength of the association of the 8 dimensions of the SF-12 questionnaire with the dependent variable was studied using the crude odds ratio with its 95% confidence interval (CI). The independent involvement of each dimension of the questionnaire with severe AS was estimated with the adjusted odds ratio (aOR), where the dependent variable was case/control and the independent variables were the results of the QoL test. Finally, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated to determine the sensitivity of the models created. All analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical package 15.0 and R, and significance level was set at 0.05.</p>\\n<p>The raw data is in a private repository and could be shared on request in a confidential manner.</p>\\n<h2>Results</h2>\\n<h3>Patient characteristics</h3>\\n<p>A total of 102 cases and 221 controls were included in this study. For each case, between 1 and 3 controls from the same primary care center were included, matched by sex and age. An average of 2.17 controls was obtained for each case. The mean age of cases was significantly higher than in controls (77.6 years vs. 75.5 years, p = 0.003) (<a href=\"#pone-0287508-t001\">Table 1</a>), so the variable “age” was taken into account in regression models to avoid the confounding effect. No significant differences were found with regard to sex or other anthropometric variables, except in waist circumference and the presence of central obesity (<a href=\"#pone-0287508-t001\">Table 1</a>).

We explored the association between CVRF and comorbidities and symptomatic severe AS in our data set, and found that the following variables were significantly associated (p &lt;0.05): age, hemoglobin, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, low HDL-cholesterol, stroke, carotid stenosis, and chronic kidney failure.</p>\\n<p>Next, we adjusted our model for all CVFR and comorbidities significantly associated with severe symptomatic AS. The association between each dimension of QoL and symptomatic severe AS was still significant when adjusted for CVRFs and comorbidities (p &lt;0.001) (<a href=\"#pone-0287508-t002\">Table 2</a>). The area under the ROC curve showed good discrimination and predictive ability of association in all cases (ROC 0.82 to 0.87) (<a href=\"#pone-0287508-t002\">Table 2</a>).</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_target\"></p>\\n<p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287508.t002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287508.t002</a></p>\\n<p>A multivariate analysis of the 8 dimensions and SF-12 summary components, adjusted for age, sex, and the CVRF and comorbidities included in the previous model was subsequently performed. Only 3 dimensions were significantly associated in this final multiple regression model: physical function, physical role, and social function. A statistically significant inverse association was observed between the physical function and social function dimensions (p = 0.002 and p = 0.005) and an A multiple logistic regression model was constructed to evaluate the QoL in severe AS patients, adjusted for any variables that were significant in the baseline model inverse association close to significance (p = 0.052) was found between the physical role and severe AS (<a href=\"#pone-0287508-t003\">Table 3</a>).

In this study, patients with AS scored lower than controls in all QoL domains of the SF-12 questionnaire, also when adjusted for CVRF and comorbidities. In the final multiple logistic regression model, we observed a significant association between physical function and social function and AS and an almost statistically significant association with physical role after controlling for other CVRF and comorbidities.</p>\\n<p>Several tools are available for assessing QoL in the general population and in patients with specific chronic diseases. Disease-specific QoL scales focus on areas of life most affected by the disease and therefore have a higher sensitivity and specificity than general scales. However, the advantage of generic QoL instruments is that they can be used in different types of patients and populations and they can compare the relative impact of different diseases and obtain reference population values. Since no specific QoL scales for AS were available at the moment of initiation of the study, the generic SF-12 questionnaire was used in this study.</p>\\n<p>The SF-12 questionnaire measures general health and well-being and covers 8 domains: physical function, which addresses limitations in daily life due to health problems; physical role limitations due to physical problems; bodily pain, which evaluates the frequency of the pain and how it interferes on an individual level; overall health, which measures the individual’s perception of their general health status; vitality, which assesses energy and fatigue levels; social function, which measures the extent to which health status interferes with social activities; limitations in emotional role activities due to emotional problems; and mental health measured by psychological distress [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. The results of this study show that severe AS affects all dimensions of patients’ QoL.</p>\\n<p>Published data on the impact of AS on patients’ QoL are scarce. In fact, only one study comparing the QoL of patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic severe AS with the general population in 3 age groups (41–60 years, 61–70 years, and &gt; 70 years) has been conducted. This study found that QoL is lower in patients with symptomatic AS [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. Our results are in line with these data and show that the QoL of patients ≥ 65 years with symptomatic severe AS is lower than that of controls. In contrast with van Geldorp <em>et al</em>., after adjusting for CVRF and comorbidities, only two SF-12 questionnaire dimensions were associated with AS (physical function and social function) and one, almost statistically significant, was considered clinically relevant (physical role). These associations could help identify QoL issues in patients who have few symptoms and, despite recommendation in current guidelines, are not referred for intervention.</p>\\n<p>A lower self-perceived QoL appears to have no correlation with disease severity. According to van Geldorp <em>et al</em>., there is no relationship between the degree of stenosis and the PCS and MCS scores of the SF-36v2 questionnaire. However, QoL does correlate with symptoms, since asymptomatic patients report a QoL similar to that of the general population [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. Although everything points in this direction, it is not known whether the severity of symptoms is negatively correlated with self-perceived QoL, or what the specific weight of each symptom in the impact of AS on QoL might be. This is a question that should be investigated in prospective studies in the future.</p>\\n<p>In recent years, the study of QoL in patients with severe AS has focused on evaluating improvement after an intervention (AVR and/or TAVI), or on assessing the QoL of patients receiving palliative medical treatment in whom any intervention has been ruled out [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>]. HRQoL should also be taken into account when assessing health status and may be a useful parameter in the therapeutic decision-making process [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>].</p>\\n<p>Current guidelines recommend earlier intervention in patients with severe AS, in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. Compared to conservative treatment, surgical intervention improves prognostic of these patients. Despite these recommendations, between 30% and 60% of patients are still not referred for aortic valve replacement surgery [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. Underestimation of the impact of aortic stenosis symptoms on quality of life may be one of the reasons of underestimation of surgical need in both types of patients. In this way, questionnaires such as SF-12 or EQ-5D may provide a quality of life measure that would complement the clinical data of patients and contribute to the improvement of therapeutic decisions [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>]. Given the differences observed in 3 of the SF-12 questionnaire dimensions (physical function, social function, and physical role), special attention to these items might mean that patients not otherwise considered for referral could be offered intervention [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>].</p>\\n<p>This study has some limitations. Some cases who were potential candidates to participate may have died, which could mean that cases that were included had a better prognosis, bolstering the positive value of the results obtained. Likewise, controls may have been potential undiagnosed cases, since AS may not have clinical manifestations, even at advanced stages. This assumption would also further strengthen the results. With regard to sample size, 3 controls could not be selected for some cases, so the final sample size was slightly smaller than planned (221 instead of 261), thus decreasing the precision and statistical power. Despite matching by age, cases were older than controls due to the wide range used for matching (± 5 years), but age was taken into account in all regression models used. The effect of the other major CVRF and comorbidities on the QoL of cases and controls was taken into account in the regression models, but some residual confounding effect cannot be ruled out. The fact that the study was limited to people over 65 years could influence the magnitude of the association of QoL and severe AS. Finally, the results may not be applicable to other geographic areas.</p>\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>Individuals ≥ 65 years with symptomatic severe AS score worse in the 8 health dimensions and PCS and MCS of the SF-12 health questionnaire than paired controls. In the multiple logistic regression models, all SF-12 dimensions and summary components are inversely associated with symptomatic severe AS in people ≥ 65 years. In the final regression model, an inverse association between the physical function and social function dimensions of the SF-12 questionnaire is observed in severe AS. In all cases, the discriminative and predictive ability of the association of the SF-12 questionnaire dimensions with severe AS was good. The use of quality-of-life scales provides evidence for patient‐centered care and could improve the management of severe AS, reduce delayed referral and improve patients’ QoL.</p>\\n<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>\\n<p>The authors would like to thank Alba Gomez, PhD and Heather Hamilton for Medical writing and editing support.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n<h3>Subject Areas <div id=\"subjInfo\">?</div>\\n    <div id=\"subjInfoText\">\\n      <p>For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/PLOS/plos-thesaurus/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link opens in new window\">here</a>.</p>\\n      <span class=\"inline-intro\">We want your feedback.</span> Do these Subject Areas make sense for this article?

In our regional setting, prevalence in individuals ≥ 65 years is 3%, but increases exponentially with age to reach 7.4% in people &gt; 85 years [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. As life expectancy rises, it is estimated that case numbers in people &gt; 70 years of age will double or triple in the coming decades [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>].</p>\\n<p>Severe AS, if untreated, is associated with high mortality [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. In the absence of useful pharmacological treatments, the only effective treatments are aortic valve replacement (AVR) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. The therapeutic decision should take into account the clinical characteristics of the patient, the feasibility of the intervention, local experience and outcomes, and the individualized surgical risk and likelihood that the intervention will improve survival and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>].</p>\\n<p>Quality of life (QoL) can be defined as a multidimensional element that includes physical, psychological, cognitive, and social factors that affect how a person performs their activities and self-perceived degree of well-being [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>]. QoL assessments monitor the impact of a disease (and/or treatment) on a patient’s personal and social performance and are widely used in clinical practice, and SF-12 is one of the most widely used instruments [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. This questionnaire provides a generic measurement of general health and well-being and summarizes physical and mental components in 12 items divided into 8 health domains [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>].</p>\\n<p>Knowledge of the impact of AS on patients’ QoL in the population setting is still scant. Few studies evaluate QoL in patients with symptomatic severe AS, and these are mostly limited to assessing QoL after surgery (AVR or TAVI) or in patients receiving palliative treatment in whom surgical intervention has been ruled out. Only 1 study in the Netherlands reported that QoL is lower in patients with symptomatic AS [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>], but no studies have been conducted on the impact of AS on QoL in the Spanish population. Since the onset of AS symptoms is progressive but slow [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>], and patients are elderly with associated comorbidities [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>], this could lead to overlook the impact of AS on QoL and the need of surgery. As per current guidelines, patient-related QoL should be considered during the decision on the best treatment option [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. Indeed, assessing patients’ QoL can promote and provide evidence for patient-centered care [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>].</p>\\n<p>The aim of this study was to assess the impact of symptomatic severe AS on QoL in patients &gt; 65 years, compared to a control group in the same primary care setting, taking into account all cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and associated comorbidities.</p>\\n<h2>Materials and methods</h2>\\n<p>An observational epidemiological case-control study was conducted in a province of Spain between February 2014 and April 2018.</p>\\n<p>Cases had symptomatic severe AS according to the criteria established by European Society of Cardiology guidelines currently available at the time of patients’ recruitment [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>], and were &gt; 65 years. Controls, without known AS, were recruited from the same primary care center as the cases and matched by age (± 5 years) and sex, in a 1:3 ratio. The absolute number of years (± 5) for matching is considered to be high, and was taken into account in logistic regression models to neutralize this potential confounding factor.</p>\\n<p>Clinical and demographic data were prospectively obtained from patient interviews, physical examination, and consultation of medical records. Data collection, storage, and analysis were carried out according to applicable regulations. The patients gave written informed consent and the study was approved by our Hospital Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CREC) (20/2013) and the participating CREC of the Primary Care Research Institute (P16/132). A comprehensive description of study design, inclusion of cases and controls, and sample size determination can be found elsewhere [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>].</p>\\n<p>Study participants completed the SF-12v2 HRQoL questionnaire. It summarizes the physical and mental components for 12 items across 8 health domains: physical functioning (2 items), role limitations due to physical problems (2 items), bodily pain (1 item), general health (1 item), vitality (1 item), social functioning (1 item), role limitations due to emotional problems (2 items), and mental health (2 items). A non-commercial version of this questionnaire was used, under license number QM021812. The questionnaire responses were interpreted using an algorithm that determines a summary assessment for the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and another for the Mental Component Summary (MCS) dimension from the responses for each item.</p>\\n<p>Continuous variables were characterized using mean and standard deviation, and categorical variables with absolute and relative frequencies. A multiple logistic regression model was constructed to evaluate the QoL in severe AS patients, adjusted for any variables that were significant in the baseline model. Statistical methods were conducted as previously reported [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. Briefly, a two-step approach was used. First, potential confounding variables (CVRF, comorbidities) were analyzed at a baseline model. All variables with a p-value &lt;0.2 were selected and their input was carried out using forward and backward variable selection algorithms. Next, the model was readjusted testing those factors that remained in the limit area of p &lt;0.1. Final model was adjusted by age, sex and all significantly associated comorbidities and CVRF.</p>\\n<p>The strength of the association of the 8 dimensions of the SF-12 questionnaire with the dependent variable was studied using the crude odds ratio with its 95% confidence interval (CI). The independent involvement of each dimension of the questionnaire with severe AS was estimated with the adjusted odds ratio (aOR), where the dependent variable was case/control and the independent variables were the results of the QoL test. Finally, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated to determine the sensitivity of the models created. All analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical package 15.0 and R, and significance level was set at 0.05.</p>\\n<p>The raw data is in a private repository and could be shared on request in a confidential manner.</p>\\n<h2>Results</h2>\\n<h3>Patient characteristics</h3>\\n<p>A total of 102 cases and 221 controls were included in this study. For each case, between 1 and 3 controls from the same primary care center were included, matched by sex and age. An average of 2.17 controls was obtained for each case. The mean age of cases was significantly higher than in controls (77.6 years vs. 75.5 years, p = 0.003) (<a href=\"#pone-0287508-t001\">Table 1</a>), so the variable “age” was taken into account in regression models to avoid the confounding effect. No significant differences were found with regard to sex or other anthropometric variables, except in waist circumference and the presence of central obesity (<a href=\"#pone-0287508-t001\">Table 1</a>). A comprehensive description of baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of cases and controls included in the study can be found elsewhere [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>].</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_target\"></p>\\n<p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287508.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287508.t001</a></p>\\n<h3>Quality of life evaluations</h3>\\n<p>Patients with severe AS had significantly lower QoL compared with healthy controls in all dimensions of the SF-12 questionnaire (p &lt;0.001), and in the PCS and MCS components (p &lt;0.001 for both comparisons) (<a href=\"#pone-0287508-g001\">Fig 1</a>).</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p>\\n<p>MCS: Mental Component Summary, PCS: Physical Component Summary.

All QoL dimensions were inversely associated with symptomatic severe AS (p &lt;0.001) (data not shown).</p>\\n<p>CVRFs and comorbidities are associated with the risk of symptomatic severe AS [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. We explored the association between CVRF and comorbidities and symptomatic severe AS in our data set, and found that the following variables were significantly associated (p &lt;0.05): age, hemoglobin, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, low HDL-cholesterol, stroke, carotid stenosis, and chronic kidney failure.</p>\\n<p>Next, we adjusted our model for all CVFR and comorbidities significantly associated with severe symptomatic AS. The association between each dimension of QoL and symptomatic severe AS was still significant when adjusted for CVRFs and comorbidities (p &lt;0.001) (<a href=\"#pone-0287508-t002\">Table 2</a>). The area under the ROC curve showed good discrimination and predictive ability of association in all cases (ROC 0.82 to 0.87) (<a href=\"#pone-0287508-t002\">Table 2</a>).</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_target\"></p>\\n<p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287508.t002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287508.t002</a></p>\\n<p>A multivariate analysis of the 8 dimensions and SF-12 summary components, adjusted for age, sex, and the CVRF and comorbidities included in the previous model was subsequently performed. Only 3 dimensions were significantly associated in this final multiple regression model: physical function, physical role, and social function. A statistically significant inverse association was observed between the physical function and social function dimensions (p = 0.002 and p = 0.005) and an A multiple logistic regression model was constructed to evaluate the QoL in severe AS patients, adjusted for any variables that were significant in the baseline model inverse association close to significance (p = 0.052) was found between the physical role and severe AS (<a href=\"#pone-0287508-t003\">Table 3</a>).

In this study, patients with AS scored lower than controls in all QoL domains of the SF-12 questionnaire, also when adjusted for CVRF and comorbidities. In the final multiple logistic regression model, we observed a significant association between physical function and social function and AS and an almost statistically significant association with physical role after controlling for other CVRF and comorbidities.</p>\\n<p>Several tools are available for assessing QoL in the general population and in patients with specific chronic diseases. Disease-specific QoL scales focus on areas of life most affected by the disease and therefore have a higher sensitivity and specificity than general scales. However, the advantage of generic QoL instruments is that they can be used in different types of patients and populations and they can compare the relative impact of different diseases and obtain reference population values. Since no specific QoL scales for AS were available at the moment of initiation of the study, the generic SF-12 questionnaire was used in this study.</p>\\n<p>The SF-12 questionnaire measures general health and well-being and covers 8 domains: physical function, which addresses limitations in daily life due to health problems; physical role limitations due to physical problems; bodily pain, which evaluates the frequency of the pain and how it interferes on an individual level; overall health, which measures the individual’s perception of their general health status; vitality, which assesses energy and fatigue levels; social function, which measures the extent to which health status interferes with social activities; limitations in emotional role activities due to emotional problems; and mental health measured by psychological distress [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. The results of this study show that severe AS affects all dimensions of patients’ QoL.</p>\\n<p>Published data on the impact of AS on patients’ QoL are scarce. In fact, only one study comparing the QoL of patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic severe AS with the general population in 3 age groups (41–60 years, 61–70 years, and &gt; 70 years) has been conducted. This study found that QoL is lower in patients with symptomatic AS [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. Our results are in line with these data and show that the QoL of patients ≥ 65 years with symptomatic severe AS is lower than that of controls. In contrast with van Geldorp <em>et al</em>., after adjusting for CVRF and comorbidities, only two SF-12 questionnaire dimensions were associated with AS (physical function and social function) and one, almost statistically significant, was considered clinically relevant (physical role). These associations could help identify QoL issues in patients who have few symptoms and, despite recommendation in current guidelines, are not referred for intervention.</p>\\n<p>A lower self-perceived QoL appears to have no correlation with disease severity. According to van Geldorp <em>et al</em>., there is no relationship between the degree of stenosis and the PCS and MCS scores of the SF-36v2 questionnaire. However, QoL does correlate with symptoms, since asymptomatic patients report a QoL similar to that of the general population [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. Although everything points in this direction, it is not known whether the severity of symptoms is negatively correlated with self-perceived QoL, or what the specific weight of each symptom in the impact of AS on QoL might be. This is a question that should be investigated in prospective studies in the future.</p>\\n<p>In recent years, the study of QoL in patients with severe AS has focused on evaluating improvement after an intervention (AVR and/or TAVI), or on assessing the QoL of patients receiving palliative medical treatment in whom any intervention has been ruled out [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>]. HRQoL should also be taken into account when assessing health status and may be a useful parameter in the therapeutic decision-making process [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>].</p>\\n<p>Current guidelines recommend earlier intervention in patients with severe AS, in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. Compared to conservative treatment, surgical intervention improves prognostic of these patients. Despite these recommendations, between 30% and 60% of patients are still not referred for aortic valve replacement surgery [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. Underestimation of the impact of aortic stenosis symptoms on quality of life may be one of the reasons of underestimation of surgical need in both types of patients. In this way, questionnaires such as SF-12 or EQ-5D may provide a quality of life measure that would complement the clinical data of patients and contribute to the improvement of therapeutic decisions [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>]. Given the differences observed in 3 of the SF-12 questionnaire dimensions (physical function, social function, and physical role), special attention to these items might mean that patients not otherwise considered for referral could be offered intervention [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>].</p>\\n<p>This study has some limitations. Some cases who were potential candidates to participate may have died, which could mean that cases that were included had a better prognosis, bolstering the positive value of the results obtained. Likewise, controls may have been potential undiagnosed cases, since AS may not have clinical manifestations, even at advanced stages. This assumption would also further strengthen the results. With regard to sample size, 3 controls could not be selected for some cases, so the final sample size was slightly smaller than planned (221 instead of 261), thus decreasing the precision and statistical power. Despite matching by age, cases were older than controls due to the wide range used for matching (± 5 years), but age was taken into account in all regression models used. The effect of the other major CVRF and comorbidities on the QoL of cases and controls was taken into account in the regression models, but some residual confounding effect cannot be ruled out. The fact that the study was limited to people over 65 years could influence the magnitude of the association of QoL and severe AS. Finally, the results may not be applicable to other geographic areas.</p>\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>Individuals ≥ 65 years with symptomatic severe AS score worse in the 8 health dimensions and PCS and MCS of the SF-12 health questionnaire than paired controls. In the multiple logistic regression models, all SF-12 dimensions and summary components are inversely associated with symptomatic severe AS in people ≥ 65 years. In the final regression model, an inverse association between the physical function and social function dimensions of the SF-12 questionnaire is observed in severe AS. In all cases, the discriminative and predictive ability of the association of the SF-12 questionnaire dimensions with severe AS was good. The use of quality-of-life scales provides evidence for patient‐centered care and could improve the management of severe AS, reduce delayed referral and improve patients’ QoL.</p>\\n<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>\\n<p>The authors would like to thank Alba Gomez, PhD and Heather Hamilton for Medical writing and editing support.</p>\\n<h2>References</h2>\\n<h3>Subject Areas <div id=\"subjInfo\">?</div>\\n    <div id=\"subjInfoText\">\\n      <p>For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/PLOS/plos-thesaurus/blob/master/README.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link opens in new window\">here</a>.</p>\\n      <span class=\"inline-intro\">We want your feedback.</span> Do these Subject Areas make sense for this article?

       "<p>Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common surgically managed valvular heart disease and the third most common cardiovascular disease in Western countries [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>]. In our regional setting, prevalence in individuals ≥ 65 years is 3%, but increases exponentially with age to reach 7.4% in people &gt; 85 years [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. As life expectancy rises, it is estimated that case numbers in people &gt; 70 years of age will double or triple in the coming decades [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>Severe AS, if untreated, is associated with high mortality [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. In the absence of useful pharmacological treatments, the only effective treatments are aortic valve replacement (AVR) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. The therapeutic decision should take into account the clinical characteristics of the patient, the feasibility of the intervention, local experience and outcomes, and the individualized surgical risk and likelihood that the intervention will improve survival and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>Quality of life (QoL) can be defined as a multidimensional element that includes physical, psychological, cognitive, and social factors that affect how a person performs their activities and self-perceived degree of well-being [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>]. QoL assessments monitor the impact of a disease (and/or treatment) on a patient’s personal and social performance and are widely used in clinical practice, and SF-12 is one of the most widely used instruments [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. This questionnaire provides a generic measurement of general health and well-being and summarizes physical and mental components in 12 items divided into 8 health domains [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>Knowledge of the impact of AS on patients’ QoL in the population setting is still scant. Few studies evaluate QoL in patients with symptomatic severe AS, and these are mostly limited to assessing QoL after surgery (AVR or TAVI) or in patients receiving palliative treatment in whom surgical intervention has been ruled out. Only 1 study in the Netherlands reported that QoL is lower in patients with symptomatic AS [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>], but no studies have been conducted on the impact of AS on QoL in the Spanish population. Since the onset of AS symptoms is progressive but slow [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>], and patients are elderly with associated comorbidities [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>], this could lead to overlook the impact of AS on QoL and the need of surgery. As per current guidelines, patient-related QoL should be considered during the decision on the best treatment option [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. Indeed, assessing patients’ QoL can promote and provide evidence for patient-centered care [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>The aim of this study was to assess the impact of symptomatic severe AS on QoL in patients &gt; 65 years, compared to a control group in the same primary care setting, taking into account all cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and associated comorbidities.</p>\n",

Controls, without known AS, were recruited from the same primary care center as the cases and matched by age (± 5 years) and sex, in a 1:3 ratio. The absolute number of years (± 5) for matching is considered to be high, and was taken into account in logistic regression models to neutralize this potential confounding factor.</p>\n",
       "<p>Clinical and demographic data were prospectively obtained from patient interviews, physical examination, and consultation of medical records.

A non-commercial version of this questionnaire was used, under license number QM021812. The questionnaire responses were interpreted using an algorithm that determines a summary assessment for the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and another for the Mental Component Summary (MCS) dimension from the responses for each item.</p>\n",
       "<p>Continuous variables were characterized using mean and standard deviation, and categorical variables with absolute and relative frequencies. A multiple logistic regression model was constructed to evaluate the QoL in severe AS patients, adjusted for any variables that were significant in the baseline model. Statistical methods were conducted as previously reported [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. Briefly, a two-step approach was used. First, potential confounding variables (CVRF, comorbidities) were analyzed at a baseline model. All variables with a p-value &lt;0.2 were selected and their input was carried out using forward and backward variable selection algorithms. Next, the model was readjusted testing those factors that remained in the limit area of p &lt;0.1.

       "<p>The SF-12 questionnaire measures general health and well-being and covers 8 domains: physical function, which addresses limitations in daily life due to health problems; physical role limitations due to physical problems; bodily pain, which evaluates the frequency of the pain and how it interferes on an individual level; overall health, which measures the individual’s perception of their general health status; vitality, which assesses energy and fatigue levels; social function, which measures the extent to which health status interferes with social activities; limitations in emotional role activities due to emotional problems; and mental health measured by psychological distress [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. The results of this study show that severe AS affects all dimensions of patients’ QoL.</p>\n",
       "<p>Published data on the impact of AS on patients’ QoL are scarce. In fact, only one study comparing the QoL of patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic severe AS with the general population in 3 age groups (41–60 years, 61–70 years, and &gt; 70 years) has been conducted. This study found that QoL is lower in patients with symptomatic AS [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. Our results are in line with these data and show that the QoL of patients ≥ 65 years with symptomatic severe AS is lower than that of controls. In contrast with van Geldorp <em>et al</em>., after adjusting for CVRF and comorbidities, only two SF-12 questionnaire dimensions were associated with AS (physical function and social function) and one, almost statistically significant, was considered clinically relevant (physical role). These associations could help identify QoL issues in patients who have few symptoms and, despite recommendation in current guidelines, are not referred for intervention.</p>\n",
       "<p>A lower self-perceived QoL appears to have no correlation with disease severity. According to van Geldorp <em>et al</em>., there is no relationship between the degree of stenosis and the PCS and MCS scores of the SF-36v2 questionnaire. However, QoL does correlate with symptoms, since asymptomatic patients report a QoL similar to that of the general population [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. Although everything points in this direction, it is not known whether the severity of symptoms is negatively correlated with self-perceived QoL, or what the specific weight of each symptom in the impact of AS on QoL might be. This is a question that should be investigated in prospective studies in the future.</p>\n",
       "<p>In recent years, the study of QoL in patients with severe AS has focused on evaluating improvement after an intervention (AVR and/or TAVI), or on assessing the QoL of patients receiving palliative medical treatment in whom any intervention has been ruled out [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>]. HRQoL should also be taken into account when assessing health status and may be a useful parameter in the therapeutic decision-making process [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>Current guidelines recommend earlier intervention in patients with severe AS, in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. Compared to conservative treatment, surgical intervention improves prognostic of these patients. Despite these recommendations, between 30% and 60% of patients are still not referred for aortic valve replacement surgery [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. Underestimation of the impact of aortic stenosis symptoms on quality of life may be one of the reasons of underestimation of surgical need in both types of patients. In this way, questionnaires such as SF-12 or EQ-5D may provide a quality of life measure that would complement the clinical data of patients and contribute to the improvement of therapeutic decisions [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>]. Given the differences observed in 3 of the SF-12 questionnaire dimensions (physical function, social function, and physical role), special attention to these items might mean that patients not otherwise considered for referral could be offered intervention [<a href=\"#pone.0287508.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>].</p>\n",
       "<p>This study has some limitations. Some cases who were potential candidates to participate may have died, which could mean that cases that were included had a better prognosis, bolstering the positive value of the results obtained. Likewise, controls may have been potential undiagnosed cases, since AS may not have clinical manifestations, even at advanced stages. This assumption would also further strengthen the results. With regard to sample size, 3 controls could not be selected for some cases, so the final sample size was slightly smaller than planned (221 instead of 261), thus decreasing the precision and statistical power. Despite matching by age, cases were older than controls due to the wide range used for matching (± 5 years), but age was taken into account in all regression models used. The effect of the other major CVRF and comorbidities on the QoL of cases and controls was taken into account in the regression models, but some residual confounding effect cannot be ruled out. The fact that the study was limited to people over 65 years could influence the magnitude of the association of QoL and severe AS. Finally, the results may not be applicable to other geographic areas.</p>\n",
       "<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n",
       "<p>Individuals ≥ 65 years with symptomatic severe AS score worse in the 8 health dimensions and PCS and MCS of the SF-12 health questionnaire than paired controls. In the multiple logistic regression models, all SF-12 dimensions and summary components are inversely associated with symptomatic severe AS in people ≥ 65 years. In the final regression model, an inverse association between the physical function and social function dimensions of the SF-12 questionnaire is observed in severe AS. In all cases, the discriminative and predictive ability of the association of the SF-12 questionnaire dimensions with severe AS was good. The use of quality-of-life scales provides evidence for patient‐centered care and could improve the management of severe AS, reduce delayed referral and improve patients’ QoL.</p>\n",

It is typically classified as either spontaneous, defined as SCInf without any inciting event, or periprocedural, which typically occur in conjunction with vascular surgery with aortic manipulations. While periprocedural SCInf has recently been the subject of intensified research, especially focusing on the primary prevention of this complication, spontaneous SCInf remains less studied.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Methods and analysis</strong> Electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science and Embase, will be searched using the keywords “spinal cord”, “infarction”, “ischemia” and “spontaneous”. The search will be set to provide only English studies published from database inception. Editorials, letters and reviews will also be excluded. Reference lists of relevant records will also be searched. Identified studies will be screened for inclusion, by one reviewer in the first step and then three in the next step to decrease the risk of bias. The synthesis will address several topics of interest including epidemiology, presentation, diagnostics, treatment strategies, outcomes and predictors. The review aims to gather the body of evidence to summarise the current knowledge on SCInf. This will lead to a better understanding of the condition, its risk factors, diagnosis and management. Moreover, the review will also provide an understanding of the prognosis of patients with SCInf with respect to neurological function, quality of life and mortality. Finally, this overview of the literature will allow the identification of knowledge gaps to help guide future research efforts.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Ethics and dissemination</strong> Ethics approval was not required for our review as it is based on existing publications.

To address this gap, Zalewski <em>et al</em> proposed a diagnostic algorithm that relies on clinical presentation, imaging and other complementary diagnostic methods.<a id=\"xref-ref-11-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-11\">11</a> SCInf was divided into either spontaneous or periprocedural, and subclassified, based on the specificity of the diagnostic findings into definite, probable or possible (<a id=\"xref-fig-1-1\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F1\">figure 1</a>).</p>\\n<p id=\"p-10\" class=\"first-child\">Flow chart illustrating the categorisation of SCInf based on the certainty of diagnostic findings, as defined by Zalewski <em>et al.</em><a id=\"xref-ref-11-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-11\">11</a> CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; SCInf, spinal cord infarction.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-11\">Spontaneous SCInf has been hypothesised to result from vascular disease processes analogous to those in cerebral stroke. However, the pathophysiology of spontaneous SCInf has been the subject of significantly less research.<a id=\"xref-ref-17-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-17\">17</a> Nonetheless, the presence of vascular risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes and smoking is well documented in patients with spontaneous SCInf.<a id=\"xref-ref-11-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-11\">11</a> However, more research is needed to clarify causal relationships.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-12\">While it is easier to diagnose periprocedural SCInf, as they are well-established complications mainly occurring in conjunction with aortic surgery, the diagnosis of spontaneous SCInf, remains more challenging. This complexity derives from several factors, of which the rarity of the condition,<a id=\"xref-ref-1-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-1\">1–4</a> its overlap with other acute myelopathies,<a id=\"xref-ref-5-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-5\">5 9 11</a> and the variability in presenting signs and symptoms, are the largest contributors. Additionally, previous studies seem to indicate that up to half of imaging workups in patients with a clinical suspicion of SCInf may return normal<a id=\"xref-ref-18-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-18\">18</a> and that a spinal cord lesion may not be accurately discernible with T2-weighted imaging during the first 15 hours.<a id=\"xref-ref-14-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-14\">14 16 19</a> Hence, spontaneous SCInfs require a certain degree of clinical suspicion and expertise in order for a timely diagnosis to be made.<a id=\"xref-ref-16-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-16\">16</a></p>\\n<p id=\"p-13\">Currently, there are no clear guidelines for the management of SCInf.<a id=\"xref-ref-15-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-15\">15</a> Measures have been suggested, to prevent the occurrence of periprocedural ones. Although still a matter of debate,<a id=\"xref-ref-15-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-15\">15 20–22</a> cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage was proposed as a means to reduce intraspinal pressure and thereby enhance perfusion of the spinal cord.<a id=\"xref-ref-21-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-21\">21</a> In fact, recent reports addressing this topic have emphasised the value of maintaining an adequate spinal cord perfusion pressure, both during and after aortic procedures.<a id=\"xref-ref-23-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-23\">23</a> In contrast, the management of spontaneous SCInf, mainly relies on the treatment guidelines of ischaemic cerebral stroke and myocardial infarction. Consequently, the mainstay consists of the reduction of cardiovascular risk factors<a id=\"xref-ref-24-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-24\">24</a> and antiplatelet therapy in eligible patients.<a id=\"xref-ref-25-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-25\">25</a> In the acute phase, thrombolytic therapy has been described.<a id=\"xref-ref-24-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-24\">24 26 27</a> However, the available literature includes only a few cases and consequently evidence to support this treatment strategy is currently lacking. Similarly, the use of corticosteroids early in the course of SCInf has been suggested, but supporting evidence is scarce.<a id=\"xref-ref-28-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28</a></p>\\n<p id=\"p-14\">The ability to walk is an essential parameter in the aftermath of spinal cord injury. In SCInf, previous surveys are conflicting regarding the proportion of patients with preserved ambulatory function (walking with or without aids) ranging from 38%<a id=\"xref-ref-9-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-9\">9</a> to 70%.<a id=\"xref-ref-18-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-18\">18</a> Considering neurological function at long-term follow-up, previous studies seem to agree that a gradual improvement occurs during an extended period of time after SCInf.<a id=\"xref-ref-29-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-29\">29 30</a> Analysis of the predictors of unfavourable outcomes revealed multisegment lesions,<a id=\"xref-ref-4-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-4\">4</a> lower admission ASIA scores<a id=\"xref-ref-18-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-18\">18</a> and older age<a id=\"xref-ref-2-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-2\">2</a> as predictors of outcome. Sex has not been identified as an outcome predictor.<a id=\"xref-ref-18-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-18\">18</a> Although not consistent through the literature,<a id=\"xref-ref-30-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30</a> there seems to be preliminary evidence pointing towards worse outcomes in patients with periprocedural SCInf, in contrast to those with spontaneous SCInf.<a id=\"xref-ref-2-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-2\">2 31</a></p>\\n<p id=\"p-15\">The lack of definitive guidelines for the diagnosis and management of SCInf, as well as the conflicting evidence present throughout the literature warrants a review to identify and summarise the current knowledge regarding risk factors, diagnosis, management, and outcomes of spontaneous SCInf. The planned systematic review aims to synthesise the relevant knowledge pertaining to this topic as well as to highlight knowledge gaps in need of intensified research efforts. Contrary to periprocedural SCInf where comprehensive systematic reviews have been extensively carried out,<a id=\"xref-ref-23-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-23\">23 32–35</a> there are to the best of our knowledge none addressing spontaneous SCInf. Instead of the more classic Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome criteria, we decide to use the Sample, Phenomenon of Interest, Design, Evaluation, Research typecriteria,<a id=\"xref-ref-36-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-36\">36</a> which we believe are better suited to the purpose of this review (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-1\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>).</p>\\n<p id=\"p-16\" class=\"first-child\">SPIDER criteria</p>\\n<h2 class=\"\">Methods and analysis</h2>\\n<h3>Study registration</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-18\">This protocol for an intended systematic review is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocol (PRISMA-P) statement of 2015.<a id=\"xref-ref-37-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-37\">37</a> The PRISMA-P checklist is provided as<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-1\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental file 1</a>. The systematic review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (registration ID: CED42023393241; registration date: 24 February 2023).</p>\\n<h3 class=\"\">Supplemental material</h3>\\n<h3>Patient and public involvement</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-20\">Patients were not involved in the design or conception of the study.</p>\\n<h3>Eligibility criteria</h3>\\n<h4>Inclusion criteria</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-21\">All peer-reviewed and original studies, written in English and available in the PubMed, Embase or Web of Science databases from inception and onwards, will be eligible for inclusion.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-22\">All patient with spontaneous SCInf will be included, regardless of age, ethnicity and sex.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-23\">Epidemiological data such as age, sex and socioeconomic factors, risk factors, diagnosis and management strategies, outcomes and predictors will all be addressed. Furthermore, outcome parameters, including pathological mechanisms, quality of life and mortality, will be explored on sufficient data.</p>\\n<h4>Exclusion criteria</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-24\">Non-original publications such as reviews, editorials and letters to the editor will be disregarded together with conference abstracts and case reports. Studies found in languages other than English will be excluded for practical reasons. Non-spontaneous cases of SCInf occurring after clear inciting events, such as surgery, trauma or hypovolaemic shock will be disregarded and excluded from the analysis. Studies only addressing SCInfs secondary to vertebral artery dissections will also be excluded, as this topic has specifically been addressed in a previous systematic review.<a id=\"xref-ref-38-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-38\">38</a></p>\\n<h3>Databases and search strategy</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-25\">An electronic database search will be performed in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. A filter will be used to exclude non-English studies. To illustrate the process, the preliminary search strategy for each of the databases is provided (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-2-1\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC2\">online supplemental file 2</a>).</p>\\n<h3 class=\"\">Supplemental material</h3>\\n<h3>Study selection</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-27\">The records retrieved from the different databases will be exported into the Rayyan Software.<a id=\"xref-ref-39-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-39\">39</a> After deduplication, the records will be screened based on title and abstract by one reviewer, to eliminate records that are plainly irrelevant. This is necessary as an unmanageable number of records is foreseen due to the broad search strategy that will be used. In the next step, three independent and blinded reviewers will be assigned the task of examining the remaining records applying the eligibility criteria based on full-text reading. Potential disagreements will be resolved by discussion with a fourth reviewer. Finally, reference lists of the selected articles will be thoroughly reviewed for any potentially eligible studies that were previously missed. The whole process will be illustrated in a PRISMA flow chart, which will be provided in the final manuscript.</p>\\n<h3>Data extraction</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-28\">Data from selected records will be extracted using a predefined extraction template, preliminarily including (1) general information—title, first author, journal, publication year, etc; (2) study characteristics—study type, sample size, follow-up time, etc; (3) patient characteristics and epidemiology—age, sex, spinal segment involved, presenting symptoms and neurological function, etc; (4) diagnosis and treatment characteristics—diagnostic modalities, treatment strategy, etc and (5) outcomes—neurological outcomes, predictors of outcome, quality of life, etc. The collaboration of multiple reviewers will be sought to achieve thorough extraction of the data. The final work will be assessed and cross-checked to prevent any error.</p>\\n<h3>Assessment of risk of bias</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-29\">The Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine system,<a id=\"xref-ref-40-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-40\">40</a> modified by Wright <em>et al</em>, will be used to assess evidence levels<a id=\"xref-ref-41-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-41\">41 42</a> (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-2-1\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T2\">table 2</a>). The selected articles will be allocated to one of four levels based on methodological quality, since the fifth level (V) pertains to expert opinions which are systematically excluded from our study. Risk of bias will be assessed using the appropriate tools specific to the type of study, as defined by Ma <em>et al</em>.<a id=\"xref-ref-43-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-43\">43</a></p>\\n<p id=\"p-30\" class=\"first-child\">Level of evidence based on primary research question by Wright <em>et al</em><a id=\"xref-ref-41-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-41\">41</a></p>\\n<h3>Data synthesis</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-54\">After extraction, the data obtained from eligible studies will be systematically presented. Topics of interest to this review are chosen as follows:</p>\\n<p id=\"p-55\">Patient characteristics: epidemiology and risk factors.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-56\">SCInf characteristics: spinal cord level affected and associated presenting symptoms.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-57\">Diagnosis: modalities used.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-58\">Management: treatment options and strategies adopted.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-59\">Patient outcomes: neurological outcomes, and predictors, quality of life and mortality.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-60\">The synthesis will address each of the mentioned topics in separate sections. In the absence of a satisfactory amount or quality of data, the synthesis will primarily take a narrative form and pool the available evidence to achieve higher power and more reliable information. Meta-analysis will only be performed for research questions where rigorous, homogeneous and sufficient data are available. A similar methodology has been described in several of our previous works.<a id=\"xref-ref-44-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-44\">44–47</a></p>\\n<h2 class=\"\">Ethics and dissemination</h2>\\n<p id=\"p-61\">Ethics approval is not required for this systematic review as it is based on existing publications. The review is planned to take place between the months of February and August of the year of 2023. We then plan to submit our work to a peer-reviewed journal where the results will be openly available.</p>\\n<h2 class=\"\">Ethics statements</h2>\\n<h3>Patient consent for publication</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-68\" class=\"ethics-consent-to-publish\">Not applicable.</p>\\n<h2 class=\"\">References</h2>\\n<h2 class=\"pane-title\">Supplementary materials</h2>\\n<h2>Supplementary Data</h2>\\n<p>This web only file has been produced by the BMJ Publishing Group from an electronic\\n               file supplied by the author(s) and has not been edited for content.\\n            </p>\\n<h2>Footnotes</h2>\\n<p id=\"p-62\"><span class=\"fn-label\">Contributors</span> VGE-H: conception and design of the work, drafting of the article, critical revision, and final approval of the version to be published.
