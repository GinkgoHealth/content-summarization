      "ABSTRACT (239 words)  22 Chronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated wi th tremendous socioeconomic 23 costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective d ue, in part, to the multi-factorial 24 nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, 25 but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fl uctuations in ovarian hormones 26 (i.e., 17ß-oestradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s 27 pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possi ble interactions between 28 hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration 29 (HYPO, 24 hr of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity  in 14 eumenorrheic women during 30 the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their m enstrual cycle. We also examined 31 whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated 32 serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. 33 Compared to euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, ηp\n",
      "2 = 0.37) and 34 increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; ηp\n",
      "2 = 0.55)  and unpleasantness 35 (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; ηp\n",
      "2 = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase.  36 Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (Visual Analogue Scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, 37 ηp\n",
      "2 = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohy dration increases pain 38 sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.  39  40 Key words: Hydration, Drinking, Estrogen, Females, Algesia, Ischemia \n",
      "41  42 NEW & NOTEWORTHY (75 words) 43 Whether hypohydration can increase pain in women remains untested. Menstrual phase may 44 influence pain, but findings are equivocal and may be confounde d by the lack of hydration 45 measures. We found that pain sensitivity in women increased after 24h of fluid restriction vs. ad 46 libitum fluid intake, but did not differ between menstrual phases. Wat er ingestion did not acutely 47 attenuate the negative effects of hypohydration on pain, highlighting the importance of staying 48 well-hydrated throughout the day.    49 \n",
      "INTRODUCTION 50 Pain is recognized as a public health problem (1). Chronic pain  [i.e., pain that persists for ≥ 3 51 months (2)] in particular, affects approximately 20% of the global population (3,4), with negative 52 consequences to the individual, society, healthcare, and the economy. In the USA, the annual 53 cost of chronic pain is estimated to be $635 million – more tha n that of heart disease, cancer and 54 diabetes combined (5). However, chronic pain treatment has prov en difficult due to the complex 55 and multi-factorial nature of pain (6). In a survey conducted a cross several European countries, 56 40% of chronic pain sufferers reported feeling dissatisfied with the effectiveness of their pain 57 treatment(s) (4). Hence, more research on the mechanisms and fa ctors contributing to a person’s 58 pain experience is needed. Given the various complexities of st udying chronic pain (e.g., ethical, 59 logistical, medical considerations), such research is usually performed by administering various 60 acute experimental pain stimuli to healthy individuals.  61 Recent studies have shown that hypohydration can increase exper imental pain sensitivity (7,8). 62 Mild hypohydration of <1% body mass loss, induced by prior fast ing and exercise, was found to 63 decrease pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) during a cold pressor task in men, 64 compared to when they were rehydrated (7). These findings were supported in a later study, 65 where subjective ratings of cold pressor pain in men were highe r after 24 h of fluid restriction 66 (1.4% body mass loss) than in the euhydrated condition (8). Sim ilarly, a field study showed that 67 hypohydrated cyclists perceived more intense pain in their leg muscles during an ultra-endurance 68 race, compared to the euhydrated cyclists (9). However, these s tudies were primarily performed 69 in men and the effects of hypohydration on pain in women have n ot been formally investigated.   70 Several chronic pain conditions are more prevalent among women than men (10). Women also 71 tend to display greater sensitivity to various experimental pai n stimuli (11). Furthermore, pain 72 perception in women may be influenced by hormonal fluctuations (primarily17ß-oestradiol and 73 progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle (12,13). It is generally agreed that the severity of 74 pain symptoms in several chronic pain conditions varies across the menstrual cycle (13,14); 75 however, whether the menstrual phase affects experimental pain sensitivity in healthy, pain-free 76 women is still contestable (15,16). The lack of accurate verifi cation of menstrual phases and 77 presence of various potential confounders (e.g., dysmenorrhea, dietary and lifestyle factors) in \n",
      "78 many studies could explain the inconsistent findings (15). Some studies have attempted to 79 address these issues (e.g., 17,18), but such studies are scant and did not appear to impose  a  80 progesterone threshold to ensure only ovulatory cycles were inc luded (19). Notably, none of the 81 previous studies measured hydration status of participants at the time of testing, which may be 82 influenced by menstrual phase (20,21). 83  84 The ovarian hormones affect body fluid regulatory mechanisms (2 2), with potential implications 85 for hydration status (20,21). The mid-luteal phase (high 17ß-oestradiol and progesterone) is 86 associated with an earlier release of arginine vasopressin (AVP) – a fluid-regulatory hormone 87 that increases renal water retention – and thirst during exercise-induced dehydration or 88 hypertonic saline infusion, compared to the early follicular ph ase (low 17ß-oestradiol and 89 progesterone) (23,24). This may potentially reduce the severity of dehydration for a given 90 hydration challenge in the mid-luteal phase (20,21). In the context of pain, this may suggest: 1) 91 differences in the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration in the early follicular compared to mid- 92 luteal phase, 2) potential variability in hydration status across the menstrua l cycle may have 93 \n",
      "confounded previous research on effects of the menstrual phase and experimental pain 94 sensitivity, and 3) hypohydration may reduce the efficacy of pain treatments in women (21).  95 Importantly, mild hypohydration appears to be common among wome n, with data from the USA 96 showing approximately half of the 7,855 surveyed women meeting the hypohydration criterion 97 (plasma tonicity > 295 mmol.L\n",
      "-1) (25). Therefore, the current study investigated the effects of 98 hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in women. We also 99 examined whether the negative consequences of hypohydration on pain could be remedied by 100 acute water ingestion. We hypothesized that 1) hypohydration wo uld increase experimental pain 101 sensitivity in women, 2) the magnitude of this increase in pain sensitivity would differ  between 102 the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases, and 3) ac ute water ingestion would reverse 103 the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration.  104 \n",
      "METHODS 105 Ethical Approval 106 The study was approved by the Massey University Human Ethics Co mmittee: Southern A 107 (18/66). The study conformed to the requirements of the U.S. Federal Policy for the Protection of 108 Human Subjects (45 CFR, Part 46), and the standards set by the latest revision of the Declaration 109 of Helsinki, except for registration in a database. All participants provi ded written, informed 110 consent prior to all trials. Researchers were not blinded to th e experimental conditions and 111 analyses.     112 Participants 113 Twenty-three healthy, eumenorrheic women initially volunteered for this study. As this is the 114 first study, to our knowledge, that has investigated the effect s of hypohydration and menstrual 115 phase in combination, there was no reference study to base our sample size calculations on. As 116 such, sample size was estimated from two previous studies; one on hypohydration and pain (β = 117 0.79 and effect size = 0.53) (8), the other a meta-analysis on menstrual phase effects on pain 118 (effect size = 0.5 for ischemic pain, β = 0.80) (12), which yie lded required sample sizes of n=17 119 and n=27, respectively at an α = 0.05. Therefore, we aimed for 17> n<27 and estimated the 120 required number of participants for sufficient power to be n=22. 121 Six participants did not proceed with the experimental trials d ue to scheduling difficulties; thus, 122 seventeen women completed all experimental trials [mean (SD): age, 28 (8) years; height, 1.63 123 (0.07) m; body mass, 65.0 (10.8) kg. Participants reported havi ng regular menstrual cycles (i.e., 124 21 to 35 days) at the time of recruitment and had not used horm onal contraceptives within the 125 past six months. All participants were non-smokers, had no pre- existing or history of medical, 126 psychiatric, pain-related, or menstrual-related disorders (e.g., dysmenorrhea, premenstrual 127 dysphoric disorder, premenstrual syndrome), and were not taking  any medications. Taking into 128 consideration these inclusion/exclusion criteria, women aged >1 8 < 50 years were recruited. All 129 participants, except for one, were recreationally physically active, engaging in at least 150 min of 130 structured exercise per week.  131 Experimental Overview 132 Participants attended the laboratory on six occasions: two fami liarization sessions, followed by \n",
      "133 four experimental trials. The four experimental trials were a f ull crossover of menstrual phase 134 (EF and ML) and hydration status [euhydrated (EUH) and hypohydr ated (HYPO)] and were 135 performed over one or two menstrual cycles. The order of the experimental trials was 136 randomized and counterbalanced, but the order of EUH and HYPO for each participant was 137 maintained in the different menstrual phases. The experimental trials for each participant began 138 at the same time of day (± 1 hr) to minimize diurnal variation in pain sensitivity (26) and ovarian 139 hormone concentrations (27). All trials were separated by at least 48 hr and were performed 140 under standard environmental conditions (22 °C, 50% relative hu midity, room illuminance of 141 600 lux).  142 Familiarization  143 Prior to the experimental trials, participants were familiarise d with the ischaemic pain test (see 144 Ischaemic Pain Test below) on two separate occasions to minimise potential learning and anxiety 145 effects. The first familiarisation session also included measur ement of participants’ height and 146 body mass (for calculation of fluid volume), and assessment of their maximal handgrip strength 147 \n",
      "(see Maximal Handgrip Strength Assessment) to determine the absolute intensity for the 148 submaximal contractions during the ischaemic pain test. The num ber of familiarisation sessions 149 was determined from preliminary assessment of the time course o f the learning effects, where 150 pain outcome measures appeared to plateau after 2 sessions.  151 Maximal Handgrip Strength Assessment  152 Using their non-dominant hand, participants performed three max imal voluntary contractions 153 (MVC) with a handgrip dynamometer (MLT003 Grip Force Transducer , ADInstruments Inc., 154 CO, USA) (28). Participants were asked to squeeze the dynamomet er maximally for 5 s during 155 each MVC, separated by 1 min of rest. Force output from the dyn amometer was recorded 156 (PowerLab, ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand) and displayed i n real-time (LabChart Pro, 157 ADInstruments, Dunedin, New Zealand). Maximal handgrip strength  w a s  d e t e r m i n e d  b y  158 calculating the mean of the peak values for the three MVCs. This assessment was only conducted 159 once during the first familiarisation session, rather than at t he start of each experimental trial, to 160 prevent potential effects of the MVCs on subsequent pain sensitivity (28). Furthermore, maximal 161 handgrip strength does not appear to be affected by menstrual p hase (19,29) or hypohydration 162 (30,31).  163 Dietary and Lifestyle Control 164 Participants refrained from pain-relieving medications, alcohol , and strenuous exercise at least 165 12 hr before the start of each experimental trial. Participants  also maintained their habitual 166 caffeine intake over this 24-hr period to minimise confounding effects of caffeine on pain 167 sensitivity (32) and psychological variables (33,34). To prevent caffeine withdrawal during the 168 hypohydrated trials, participants who normally consumed caffein ated beverages were given a 169 caffeine tablet (No-Doz Awakeners, Novartis Consumer Health Inc .) to take in place of the 170 beverages. Participants recorded their diet, physical activity, and time to bed and wake (i.e. sleep 171 duration) during the 24-hr period b e f o r e  t h e i r  f i r s t  t r i a l  a n d  were asked to replicate these for 172 subsequent trials. Participants completed a dietary and lifestyle record sheet at the start of each 173 trial to assess adherence to these instructions.  174 Menstrual Cycle Phase and Hydration Intervention  175 Participants were tested during the EF and ML phases of their menstrual cycle to maximise the 176 phase difference in ovarian hormone concentrations. The EF tria ls took place on days 4 (1) and 6 177 (2) and the ML trials on days 20 (2) and 22 (2), with day 1 rep resenting start of menses and 178 assuming a conventional 28-day menstrual cycle. Testing was sch e d u l e d  u s i n g  t h e  t h r e e - s t e p  179 method (35) whereby self-reported menses onset and urinary lute\n",
      "inizing hormone (LH) testing 180 (EasyCheck\n",
      "® Ovulation Test, Phoenix Medcare Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand) prospectively 181 identified EF and ML, whilst measurement of serum 17β-estradiol  and progesterone 182 retrospectively confirmed ML. The EF phase was further verified by 17ß-oestradiol 183 concentrations that were lower than in ML. Participants started daily LH testing 16 days prior to 184 the end of a typical cycle until a positive LH test result was obtained (confirmed visually by the 185 researchers), with ML trials then scheduled six to ten days after the positive LH test. To ensure 186 ovulation had occurred and to minimize the likelihood of including anovulatory or luteal phase 187 deficient cycles, participants with progesterone < 5 ng·ml\n",
      "−1 were excluded from the final 188 analyses (19,36).   189 \n",
      "Twenty-four hours prior to each trial, participants were instru cted to either restrict fluid intake 190 and avoid consumption of high-water content foods (>50%) (e.g., soups, vegetables and fruits) 191 (HYPO), or to drink ad libitum (EUH). Participants recorded the ir food and fluid intake over this 192 24-hr period retrospectively at the start of each trial (see Dietary and Lifestyle Control and 193 Experimental Protocol). 194 Experimental Protocol  195 Upon arrival at the laboratory, a blood sample was obtained from the antecubital vein of the 196 dominant arm via venepuncture. Participants then provided a urine sample and had their body 197 mass measured. Urine specific gravity (USG) was measured immedi ately to confirm euhydration 198 (USG < 1.020) or hypohydration (USG ≥ 1.020) (37). Participants then completed the dietary 199 and lifestyle record sheet, Centre for Epidemiologic Studies De pression Scale (CES-D) (EUH 200 only; see Measurements below) and thirst ratings, followed by the ischaemic pain test.  201 Immediately after the pain test, participants ingested a glass of water (5 ml.kg\n",
      "-1 of body mass 202 measured during the first familiarisation) and finished it with in 5 min. This volume of water was 203 previously shown to produce an immediate decrease in thirst per ception in hypohydrated men 204 (38). A 30-min break followed, during which participants remain ed in the laboratory and 205 performed their activity of choice (e.g., reading, watching videos) that was consistent for all 206 trials. After the break, participants repeated the thirst ratin gs and ischaemic pain test. The 207 duration of the break was determined based on previous data tha t examined the reliability of 208 pressure pain measurements taken before and after 30 min of res t (39). Pain thresholds at both 209 time points were not different; however, pain ratings decreased after the 30-min break in women, 210 but not in men. Although this suggests that more than 30 min ma y be required to ameliorate 211 carryover effects, especially in women, we decided on 30 min to  prevent boredom and 212 restlessness since participants had to remain in the laboratory during this period. 213 Ischemic Pain Test  214 The ischaemic pain test consisted of the Submaximal Effort Tour niquet Procedure (40). This 215 experimental pain stimulus was chosen as it is more clinically relevant than other pain stimuli 216 (e.g., noxious heat, mechanical pressure, electrical stimulation) (41 ). A pneumatic cuff was 217 positioned on the participant’s non-dominant arm, just above th e elbow joint. The participant’s 218 arm was passively raised to a vertical position for 30 s to pro mote venous drainage. The 219 pneumatic cuff was then inflated to 250 mmHg and a stopwatch wa s started. The participant’s 220 arm was immediately lowered to a horizontal position on the tab le, such that the forearm rests on 221 the table with the elbow joint at a 90º angle. To promote forea rm ischaemia, participants 222 performed 25 handgrip exercises at 30% of their pre-determined maximum handgrip strength 223 (see Familiarisation). Each contraction was sustained for 2 s and followed by 2 s o f rest. 224 Auditory signals indicated the start and end of each contractio n. Participants received continuous 225 visual feedback of their force output and the target force on a laptop screen.  226 Upon completion of the handgrip exercises, the cuff remained in flated on the participant’s arm 227 and participants watched a nature documentary to standardise th eir attention throughout the 228 remainder of the pain test. The volume of the video was maintai ned at 30% for all trials. One 229 minute after the end of the handgrip exercises, participants rated their pain intensity and 230 unpleasantness on a 10-cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (42). Participants were asked to 231 indicate verbally when they were no longer able or willing to e ndure the pain (pain tolerance). \n",
      "232 The stopwatch was then stopped; just before the cuff was deflat ed, participants rated their pain 233 \n",
      "intensity and unpleasantness again, to verify that they had rea ched pain tolerance. Unknown to 234 participants, a maximum time limit of 20 min was enforced for the pain test.  235 Measurements 236 Anthropometric 237 Participants’ height and body mass were measured using a stadio meter (Seca, Hamburg, 238 Germany; accurate to 0.1 cm) and electronic scale (Model X3M, H IWEIGH Technologies 239 Limited, Shanghai, China; accurate to 10 g), respectively.  240 Ovarian Hormone Concentrations 241 Venous blood was collected into two 10 ml vacutainer tubes (Bec ton-Dickson, Oxford, UK). 242 One tube contained clot activator for analysis of serum osmolality (S\n",
      "osm), 17ß-oestradiol and 243 progesterone concentrations, while the other tube contained K\n",
      "3EDTA for analysis of plasma 244 copeptin. The tube containing clot activator was inverted gently and left to clot for a minimum of 245 30 min at room temperature. The whole blood in both tubes was t hen centrifuged (Centrifuge 246 5804 R, Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) at 4ºC and 260 g for 15 min to separate serum and 247 plasma from whole blood. Aliquots of serum and plasma were then  separated into three 248 Eppendorf tubes (Genuine Axygen Quality, USA) each and stored a t -80ºC for further analysis. 249 Commercially available enzyme-linked immune assays were used to measure concentrations of 250 17β-estradiol (Demeditec Diagnostics, Kiel, Germany) and progesterone (IBL International, 251 Hamburg, Germany) in serum samples, with a sensitivity of 6.2 pg.ml\n",
      "-1 and 0.045 ng.ml-1, 252 respectively, and an intra-assay variation of < 6 and < 7%, respectively. The ratio of 253 progesterone to 17ß-oestradiol (P\n",
      "4:E2 ratio) was then calculated (43). 254 Hydration Status 255 Hydration status was assessed by measurement of S\n",

Serum osmolality was measured via 257 freezing-point depression (Digimatic osmometer Model 3D2, Advan ced Instruments Inc., 258 Norwood, MA, USA). Measurements were made in duplicate and aver aged. If the two 259 measurements differed by more than 5%, a third measurement was taken and the average of the 260 two closest values was calculated. Plasma copeptin concentratio ns, a surrogate marker for AVP 261 (44,45), were measured with an automated immunofluorescent Cope ptin proAVP KRYPTOR 262 assay (B·R·A·H·M·S KRYPTOR compact PLUS analyzer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 263 Henningsdorf, Germany), with a sensitivity of 1.08 pmol.L\n",

Percent body mass change in HYPO was calculated fr om the EUH body mass 267 within the same menstrual phase.   268 Psychological Variables 269 Depressive symptomatology was assessed using the CES-D (47). Gi ven the 1-week response 270 timeframe of the CES-D, it was only administered once in each m enstrual phase during the EUH 271 trial.   272 Statistical analyses 273 All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software for Windows (IBM SPSS Statistics 274 20, NY, USA).

When main or interaction effects occurred for the two- or three-way ANOVA, post 281 hoc pair-wise analyses were conducted using paired-samples t-tests with Bonferroni correction, 282 where appropriate.

      "DISCUSSION 366 This study examined the independent and combined effects of hyp ohydration and menstrual 367 phase on experimental pain sensitivity in healthy eumenorrheic women, and the potential 368 efficacy of acute water ingestion as a remedy to the deleteriou s impact of hypohydration. The 369 main findings were that: 1) mild hypohydration increased pain sensitivity, 2) menstrual phase did 370 not affect pain sensitivity, nor did it influence the effect of hypohydration on pain, and 3) acute 371 water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity.  372 Hypohydration and Pain in Women  373 Independent of menstrual phase, mild hypohydration following 24  hr of fluid restriction reduced 374 pain tolerance (-8%) and increased pain intensity (+13%) and pain unpleasantness (+12%) 375 ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (hereafter referred to as pain ratings) during ischaemic 376 pain stimulation, when compared to euhydration. These findings are consistent with those of 377 previous studies that showed negative effects of mild hypohydration on experimental pain 378 sensitivity in men (7,8). Ogino et al. (7) observed a decrease in pain thresholds (i.e., increased 379 pain sensitivity) following a combination of exercise-induced d ehydration and fluid restriction, 380 while Bear et al. (8) found an increase in pain intensity ratings but no differe nce in pain 381 thresholds after 24 hr of fluid restriction. Therefore, the current findings extend these previous 382 results to women by showing that mild hypohydration also increa ses experimental pain 383 sensitivity in women. The previous studies also did not include  pain measures that reflect the 384 affective/emotional experience of pain (i.e., pain tolerance or pain unpleasantness ratings) which 385 may be important for chronic pain, whereas both pain threshold and pain intensity ratings assess 386 the sensory/discriminative aspect of pain (49,50). Although Bea r et al. (8) measured pain 387 tolerance, the nature of the stimulus-response relationship for  the cold pressor task – i.e., plateau 388 and gradual decline in the perceived intensity of the pain stim ulus (41) – resulted in a large 389 proportion (~2/3) of participants who were able to tolerate the pain until the 4-min cut-off time, 390 thereby precluding meaningful analyses of the results. This iss ue was not apparent with the \n",
      "391 ischaemic pain test used in the present study, as there was onl y one instance where the 20-min 392 time limit was reached. Therefore, the current findings further add to the previous data by 393 showing that mild hypohydration also negatively impacts the aff ective/emotional aspect of pain, 394 as evidenced by the decrease in pain tolerance and increase in pain unpleasantness ratings 395 compared to EUH.  396 The exact mechanisms underlying the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration cannot be 397 determined from the current data. However, one potential mechan ism through which 398 hypohydration may increase pain sensitivity is thirst perceptio n. Geuter et al. (51) showed that an 399 increase in thirst perception – induced by consumption of salty  snacks followed by 5 hr of fluid 400 deprivation – led to an increase in pain intensity ratings during noxious heat stimulation, whereas 401 subsequent ad libitum fluid intake, which reduced thirst perception, decreased pain ratings. In 402 another study, stimulation of thirst sensation via hypertonic saline infusion increased pain 403 intensity ratings during noxious pressure stimulation, which we re associated with stronger 404 activation of pain-related brain regions; namely, the anterior cingulate cortex and insula (52). 405 Similar findings were reported in the study by Ogino et al. (7). These brain regions were 406 previously shown to be activated and deactivated independently by an increase and decrease in 407 thirst perception, respectively (52,53,54). However, it is not apparent from these data whether the 408 increased pain sensitivity and pain-related brain activity were  due to thirst perception per se, 409 physiological hypohydration, or both.  410 \n",
      "Menstrual Phase and Experimental Pain Sensitivity  411 Menstrual phase did not modulate the hyperalgesic effect of hyp ohydration, nor did it 412 independently affect pain sensitivity. The lack of a menstrual phase effect on ischaemic pain 413 sensitivity is consistent with the findings of most previous st udies that examined ischaemic pain 414 responses across the menstrual cycle (18,55,56,57,58). In contr ast, studies by Fillingim et al. (59) 415 and Pfleeger et al. (60) observed greater pain sensitivity during the luteal compa red to follicular 416 phase. However, concentrations of 17ß-oestradiol and progesterone were not measured in the 417 study by Pfleeger et al. (60), whereas the specific definition of the luteal phase used  by Fillingim 418 et al. (59) differed from that in the current study. We examined the ML phase when 419 concentrations of both 17ß-oestradiol and progesterone are elevated, whereas Fillingim et al. 420 (59) included the late-luteal period in their classification of the luteal phase, during which 421 concentrations of 17ß-oestradiol and progesterone are declining  rapidly and are less stable 422 compared to the ML phase. Given that menstrual phases character ised by fluctuating or unstable 423 17ß-oestradiol levels have been associated with increased severity of various chronic pain 424 conditions  (14), this may explain why Fillingim et al. (59) ob served phase differences in pain 425 sensitivity whereas we did not.  426 The equivocal and inconclusive results regarding menstrual phas e effects on experimental pain 427 sensitivity are thought to be due, in part, to the lack of prop er verification of menstrual phases 428 through blood measurements of 17ß-oestradiol and progesterone (15,16), making it difficult to 429 draw conclusions about the relationship between menstrual phase /hormone status and pain 430 sensitivity. Similar to previous observations (22,23), S\n",
      "osm was lower in the ML than EF phase 431 (Table 2); however, this phase difference in hydration did not appear to impact any of the 432 ischemic pain measures (Figures 1-3). In this study, we showed that after hydration status was 433 controlled, menstrual phases were properly verified and potential confounders (e.g., dietary and 434 lifestyle factors, dysmenorrhea) were minimised, there was no difference in ischaemic pain 435 sensitivity between the EF and ML phases. As such, our data sug gests that the hormonal 436 fluctuations within the menstrual cycle do not greatly impact pain sensitivity.  437 Interestingly, although we did not find differences in pain sen sitivity between the EF and ML 438 phase, there was a positive correlation between 17ß-estradiol and pain sensitivity, suggesting that 439 women with higher baseline levels of 17ß-estradiol may be more sensitive to pain than those 440 with lower 17ß-estradiol levels (i.e., between-subject effect). However, given the weak strength 441 of the correlation (r = ~0.32) (48), this finding should be interpreted with caution.  442 Effects of Acute Water Ingestion  443 Given that thirst perception may be a potential mechanism linki ng hypohydration and increased 444 pain sensitivity, we hypothesised that acute water ingestion wh en hypohydrated would reduce 445 pain sensitivity. This would also help to delineate the effects of thirst and hypohydration per se, 446 on pain, since acute water ingestion would be expected to reduce thirst without altering hydration 447 status (38,61). However, contrary to our hypothesis, ischaemic pain tolerance was not affected 448 by ingestion of 5 ml.kg\n",
      "-1 of water, despite the significant decrease in thirst perceptio n ratings. 449 Meanwhile, ratings of both pain intensity and pain unpleasantne ss increased, which may appear 450 counterintuitive as participants reported feeling more pain despite being less thirsty. These 451 unexpected findings may be explained by carryover (sensitisation) effects from the baseline pain 452 test. A previous study showed that repeated pain stimulation within a single session produced a 453 sensitisation effect, whereby pain ratings increased gradually with each repeated stimulation 454 \n",
      "(62). Therefore, this sensitisation effect may have masked pote ntial positive effect of acute water 455 ingestion on pain. Future studies that either utilise a longer interval between the repeated pain 456 tests, or perform the post-water ingestion pain test on a separ ate day, are required to gain further 457 understanding on the relative importance of thirst perception and physiological hypohydration on 458 pain.   459 Considerations 460 There are several considerations and limitations of this study that should be noted above those 461 already discussed above. First, only healthy, eumenorrheic women were included in this study, 462 which ignores postmenopausal women and OCP users, who have diff erent hormonal profiles 463 compared to eumenorrheic women. Therefore, it is possible that hypohydration may affect pain 464 sensitivity differently in these women compared to eumenorrheic  women. Second, blood samples 465 were not obtained after water ingestion to confirm that hydrati on status was not altered. 466 However, previous data indicate that consuming a moderate volum e of water, similar to that in 467 the current study, does not acutely alter hydration status in hypohydrated men (38,61). 468 Additionally, the relatively short interval of 30 min between w ater ingestion and the subsequent 469 pain test was likely insufficient for hydration status to be al tered, because a previous study 470 showed that at least 75 min is required for 300 ml of water to be completely absorbed into the 471 bloodstream (63). Third, as participants could not be blinded to the hydration intervention, the 472 increased pain sensitivity observed during HYPO may have been c onfounded by nocebo effects 473 (64,65). Although participants were not aware of the study hypo theses, they were aware of the 474 aims of the study, one of which was to investigate the effects of hypohydration on pain 475 sensitivity. Given the negative connotations of hypohydration o r dehydration, it is conceivable 476 that participants would expect hypohydration to increase pain sensitivity, which may have 477 subsequently influenced participants’ actual responses to the i schemic pain test. Fourth, the body 478 mass change values in HYPO may not accurately reflect the fluid losses induced by the 24 hr of 479 fluid restriction. Due to the scheduling constraints that included two experimental visits within 3 480 d a y s  p e r  m e n s t r u a l  p h a s e ,  w e  w e re unable to obtain a baseline body mass at the start of the 481 hydration intervention; thus, body mass change in HYPO was calc ulated using EUH body mass. 482 As the EUH and HYPO trials within each menstrual phase were sep arated by at least 48 hr, it is 483 likely that the values were confounded by factors other than the change in body water content 484 (e.g., urine and fecal losses, food and fluid consumption). Ack nowledging this limitation, we 485 \n",
      "obtained other measures of hydration status (i.e., S osm, USG, copeptin and thirst ratings) in 486 addition to body mass change for a more accurate assessment of hydrations status. Lastly, our 487 sample size may have limited our ability to detect statisticall y significant menstrual phase effects 488 on pain. As such, the effects of menstrual phase on pain requir e further investigation. Our study 489 could provide a reference for future studies with a similar des ign to base their sample size 490 calculations on. Nevertheless, large effect sizes (ɳ\n",
      "p2= 0.37 to 0.55) were obtained for the main 491 effect of hypohydration on pain, with an observed power of 0.7 to 0.9, which suggests a low 492 probability of false negatives.  493 Perspectives and Significance  494 Our data indicate that hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women and this effect may not 495 be reversed immediately by water ingestion. Whereas menstrual ph a s e  ( E F  v s .  M L )  d o e s  n o t  496 appear to affect pain sensitivity. These findings suggest that insufficient water intake throughout 497 the day may exacerbate pain perception in healthy women. Given the high prevalence of 498 hypohydration among the general population (25), future studies  should investigate whether 499 \n",
      "hypohydration may worsen chronic pain conditions, and the poten tial efficacy of maintaining 500 adequate hydration in alleviating pain symptoms. This may be es pecially important for older 501 adults, who are more likely to be hypohydrated and experience chronic pain (25,66). For human 502 pain researchers, controlling or measuring hydration status of participants may be important to 503 minimise confound, as clinically and physiologically relevant t ests such as the cold pressor are 504 affected (67). Although we did not find differences in pain sen sitivity between the EF and ML 505 phases after controlling for hydration status, more high-qualit y research is required to accurately 506 determine whether menstrual phase does or does not affect pain sensitivity. Therefore, until a 507 consensus on the topic has been reached, our data do not discou nt the need for future pain 508 researchers to verify menstrual phase.   509 510 \n",

Mild dehydratio n modifies the 693 cerebrovascular response to the cold pressor test. Exp Physiol 101, 135-42.  694\\n            3.Menstrual Phase and Experimental Pain Sensitivity  411 Menstrual phase did not modulate the hyperalgesic effect of hyp ohydration, nor did it 412 independently affect pain sensitivity. The lack of a menstrual phase effect on ischaemic pain 413 sensitivity is consistent with the findings of most previous st udies that examined ischaemic pain 414 responses across the menstrual cycle (18,55,56,57,58). In contr ast, studies by Fillingim et al. (59) 415 and Pfleeger et al. (60) observed greater pain sensitivity during the luteal compa red to follicular 416 phase. However, concentrations of 17ß-oestradiol and progesterone were not measured in the 417 study by Pfleeger et al. (60), whereas the specific definition of the luteal phase used  by Fillingim 418 et al. (59) differed from that in the current study. We examined the ML phase when 419 concentrations of both 17ß-oestradiol and progesterone are elevated, whereas Fillingim et al. 420 (59) included the late-luteal period in their classification of the luteal phase, during which 421 concentrations of 17ß-oestradiol and progesterone are declining  rapidly and are less stable 422 compared to the ML phase. Given that menstrual phases character ised by fluctuating or unstable 423 17ß-oestradiol levels have been associated with increased severity of various chronic pain 424 conditions  (14), this may explain why Fillingim et al. (59) ob served phase differences in pain 425 sensitivity whereas we did not.  426 The equivocal and inconclusive results regarding menstrual phas e effects on experimental pain 427 sensitivity are thought to be due, in part, to the lack of prop er verification of menstrual phases 428 through blood measurements of 17ß-oestradiol and progesterone (15,16), making it difficult to 429 draw conclusions about the relationship between menstrual phase /hormone status and pain 430 sensitivity. Similar to previous observations (22,23), S\\nosm was lower in the ML than EF phase 431 (Table 2); however, this phase difference in hydration did not appear to impact any of the 432 ischemic pain measures (Figures 1-3). In this study, we showed that after hydration status was 433 controlled, menstrual phases were properly verified and potential confounders (e.g., dietary and 434 lifestyle factors, dysmenorrhea) were minimised, there was no difference in ischaemic pain 435 sensitivity between the EF and ML phases. As such, our data sug gests that the hormonal 436 fluctuations within the menstrual cycle do not greatly impact pain sensitivity.  437 Interestingly, although we did not find differences in pain sen sitivity between the EF and ML 438 phase, there was a positive correlation between 17ß-estradiol and pain sensitivity, suggesting that 439 women with higher baseline levels of 17ß-estradiol may be more sensitive to pain than those 440 with lower 17ß-estradiol levels (i.e., between-subject effect). However, given the weak strength 441 of the correlation (r = ~0.32) (48), this finding should be interpreted with caution.  442 Effects of Acute Water Ingestion  443 Given that thirst perception may be a potential mechanism linki ng hypohydration and increased 444 pain sensitivity, we hypothesised that acute water ingestion wh en hypohydrated would reduce 445 pain sensitivity. This would also help to delineate the effects of thirst and hypohydration per se, 446 on pain, since acute water ingestion would be expected to reduce thirst without altering hydration 447 status (38,61). However, contrary to our hypothesis, ischaemic pain tolerance was not affected 448 by ingestion of 5 ml.kg\\n-1 of water, despite the significant decrease in thirst perceptio n ratings. 449 Meanwhile, ratings of both pain intensity and pain unpleasantne ss increased, which may appear 450 counterintuitive as participants reported feeling more pain despite being less thirsty. These 451 unexpected findings may be explained by carryover (sensitisation) effects from the baseline pain 452 test. A previous study showed that repeated pain stimulation within a single session produced a 453 sensitisation effect, whereby pain ratings increased gradually with each repeated stimulation 454\\n        \"},\n",

The study found that hypohydration, caused by 24 hours of fluid restriction, increased pain sensitivity in women and reduced pain tolerance. Acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity, but it did reduce thirst perception. The study suggests that insufficient water intake throughout the day may exacerbate pain perception in healthy women. Therefore, staying well-hydrated throughout the day is important for maintaining pain tolerance. However, more high-quality research is required to accurately determine whether drinking water can improve pain tolerance.',\n",
