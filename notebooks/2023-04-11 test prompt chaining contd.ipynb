    "Total daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\n",

Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P &lt; 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.\\n</td>\n",
       "      <td>Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n</td>\n",

However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p   \n",

       "text           Chronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs.

However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p   \n",

There's new research suggesting that mild dehydration can actually increase pain sensitivity in women, and it's not affected by the menstrual cycle. The study involved 14 women who were restricted from fluids for 24 hours and they experienced reduced pain tolerance and increased pain intensity and unpleasantness. Water ingestion didn't reduce pain sensitivity, but did reduce thirst perception. These findings could have implications for pain management in women.   \n",

Current pain treatments are often ineffective due to the multifactorial nature of pain. A recent study found that mild hypohydration (24-hour fluid restriction) increases pain sensitivity in women, similar to what has been previously observed in men. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones throughout the menstrual cycle may influence pain sensitivity, but this study found that menstrual phase did not have an effect on the pain sensitivity caused by hypohydration. The study also found that acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity, but did reduce thirst perception. The results suggest that hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women, regardless of menstrual phase.   \n",
       "text           Chronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs.

Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity.

Analyzing a diverse database of males and females aged 8 days to 95 years, four distinct metabolic life stages were identified. The study found that fat-free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates to 46% above adult values at 1 year, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence to adult levels at 20 years, remains stable in adulthood even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults. These findings should inform nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan. #health #nutrition #humanaging\"   \n",
       "text           Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n   \n",

Did you know that a recent study analyzed a huge database of human energy expenditure, and found some really interesting trends over the course of our lives? They found that our daily energy needs are strongly related to our fat free mass, and that there are four distinct metabolic stages that we go through. As neonates, our daily energy expenditure is about 46% higher than adults, but it slowly declines throughout childhood and adolescence until we reach adult levels at around 20 years old. Interestingly, our daily energy expenditure stays stable throughout adulthood (even during pregnancy!), but starts to decline again once we reach 60 years old. These findings have important implications for nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan!  \n",
       "response_02    Hey, did you know that our daily energy expenditure (total expenditure) changes throughout our life course? A recent study analyzed a large, diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 years. They found that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identified four distinct metabolic life stages. \\n\\nThe first stage is neonates (0-1yr), where fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr. The second stage is childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr), where fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure declines slowly to adult levels at ~20 yr. The third stage is adulthood (20-60 yr), where fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure remains stable even during pregnancy. The final stage is older adults (60+ yr), where fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure declines. \\n\\nThese changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.  \n",

Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr).

A study of a diverse group of individuals aged 8 days to 95 years found that daily expenditure is strongly linked to fat-free mass, and there are four distinct metabolic life stages. Neonates had the highest expenditure at 46% above adult values, while adults (20-60 years) had stable expenditure levels, and older adults experienced a decline. These findings provide insight into human development and aging, and can inform nutrition and health strategies. #energyexpenditure #healthresearch #lifespan #nutritionstrategies</td>\n",

They found that our daily energy needs are strongly related to our fat free mass, and that there are four distinct metabolic stages that we go through. As neonates, our daily energy expenditure is about 46% higher than adults, but it slowly declines throughout childhood and adolescence until we reach adult levels at around 20 years old. Interestingly, our daily energy expenditure stays stable throughout adulthood (even during pregnancy!), but starts to decline again once we reach 60 years old.

       "      <td>Hey, did you know that chronic pain is a huge problem with high socioeconomic costs? Current pain treatments are often ineffective due to the multifactorial nature of pain. A recent study found that mild hypohydration (24-hour fluid restriction) increases pain sensitivity in women, similar to what has been previously observed in men. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones throughout the menstrual cycle may influence pain sensitivity, but this study found that menstrual phase did not have an effect on the pain sensitivity caused by hypohydration. The study also found that acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity, but did reduce thirst perception. The results suggest that hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women, regardless of menstrual phase.</td>\n",

Analyzing a diverse database of males and females aged 8 days to 95 years, four distinct metabolic life stages were identified. The study found that fat-free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates to 46% above adult values at 1 year, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence to adult levels at 20 years, remains stable in adulthood even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults.

However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration.

       "text                Chronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration.

Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity.

It's a big problem because the treatments we have now don't always work. A new study found that when women don't drink enough water, they feel more pain. The study looked at 14 women and found that when they were a little bit dehydrated, they felt more pain and it was harder to deal with. Drinking water right away didn't make the pain go away, but it did help them feel less thirsty. This means that it's really important to drink enough water to help manage pain.   \n",

Well, scientists found out that not drinking enough water can make this pain worse for women. They did a study with 14 women who didn't drink water for a whole day and they felt more pain than usual. Drinking water didn't make the pain go away, but it did make them less thirsty. This is important because it could help doctors find better ways to help women with chronic pain.   \n",

The things we do to try to make the pain go away don't always work because there are many different reasons why someone might have pain. A new study found that when women don't drink enough water, they feel more pain. This is similar to what happens to men. The study also found that drinking water doesn't make the pain go away, but it does make people less thirsty. The study shows that not drinking enough water can make women feel more pain, no matter what time of the month it is.   \n",

They studied people of all ages, from babies to very old people, and found that how much muscle we have is really important for how much energy we use. They also discovered that there are four different stages of life where our bodies use energy differently. When we are babies, we use the most energy, but as we get older, we use less. This information can help us make better choices about what we eat and how we take care of our bodies as we grow up.   \n",

They looked at a lot of information about boys and girls from when they were just born to when they were 95 years old. They found that our bodies use up a lot of energy when we are babies, but then it slows down as we grow up. When we become adults, it stays the same, even if we are pregnant. But when we get older, our bodies start using less energy. This information can help us make good choices about what we eat and how we take care of our bodies as we grow up.   \n",

Did you know that scientists studied how much energy people use every day and found some cool things? They found that how much energy we need is related to how much muscle we have, and that there are four different times in our lives when our energy needs change. When we're babies, we need a lot more energy than grown-ups, but as we get older, we need less and less until we're grown-ups too. Even when we're grown-ups, we need about the same amount of energy every day, but when we get really old, we need less again. This is important for knowing how to eat healthy and stay healthy at different ages!   \n",

Scientists studied a lot of data from people of all ages and found that there are four different stages of how much energy we use. \\n\\nThe first stage is when we are babies, and we use a lot of energy to grow really quickly. The second stage is when we are kids and teenagers, and we use less energy as we get older. The third stage is when we are adults, and we use about the same amount of energy every day. The last stage is when we are older adults, and we start to use less energy. \\n\\nThese changes in how much energy we use can help us understand how we grow and age, and can help us make healthy choices about what we eat and how we take care of ourselves.   \n",

However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration.

There's new research suggesting that mild dehydration can actually increase pain sensitivity in women, and it's not affected by the menstrual cycle. The study involved 14 women who were restricted from fluids for 24 hours and they experienced reduced pain tolerance and increased pain intensity and unpleasantness. Water ingestion didn't reduce pain sensitivity, but did reduce thirst perception. These findings could have implications for pain management in women.   \n",

Current pain treatments are often ineffective due to the multifactorial nature of pain. A recent study found that mild hypohydration (24-hour fluid restriction) increases pain sensitivity in women, similar to what has been previously observed in men. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones throughout the menstrual cycle may influence pain sensitivity, but this study found that menstrual phase did not have an effect on the pain sensitivity caused by hypohydration. The study also found that acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity, but did reduce thirst perception. The results suggest that hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women, regardless of menstrual phase.   \n",
       "text                Chronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs.

Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity.

Analyzing a diverse database of males and females aged 8 days to 95 years, four distinct metabolic life stages were identified. The study found that fat-free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates to 46% above adult values at 1 year, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence to adult levels at 20 years, remains stable in adulthood even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults.

       "text                Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n   \n",

Well, scientists found out that not drinking enough water can make this pain worse for women. They did a study with 14 women who didn't drink water for a whole day and they felt more pain than usual. Drinking water didn't make the pain go away, but it did make them less thirsty. This is important because it could help doctors find better ways to help women with chronic pain.   \n",

The things we do to try to make the pain go away don't always work because there are many different reasons why someone might have pain. A new study found that when women don't drink enough water, they feel more pain. This is similar to what happens to men. The study also found that drinking water doesn't make the pain go away, but it does make people less thirsty. The study shows that not drinking enough water can make women feel more pain, no matter what time of the month it is.   \n",

Did you know that scientists studied how much energy people use every day and found some cool things? They found that how much energy we need is related to how much muscle we have, and that there are four different times in our lives when our energy needs change. When we're babies, we need a lot more energy than grown-ups, but as we get older, we need less and less until we're grown-ups too. Even when we're grown-ups, we need about the same amount of energy every day, but when we get really old, we need less again. This is important for knowing how to eat healthy and stay healthy at different ages!   \n",

The second stage is when we are kids and teenagers, and we use less energy as we get older. The third stage is when we are adults, and we use about the same amount of energy every day. The last stage is when we are older adults, and we start to use less energy. \\n\\nThese changes in how much energy we use can help us understand how we grow and age, and can help us make healthy choices about what we eat and how we take care of ourselves.   \n",

Did you know that a recent study analyzed a huge database of human energy expenditure, and found some really interesting trends over the course of our lives? They found that our daily energy needs are strongly related to our fat free mass, and that there are four distinct metabolic stages that we go through. As neonates, our daily energy expenditure is about 46% higher than adults, but it slowly declines throughout childhood and adolescence until we reach adult levels at around 20 years old. Interestingly, our daily energy expenditure stays stable throughout adulthood (even during pregnancy!), but starts to decline again once we reach 60 years old. These findings have important implications for nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan!  \n",
       "response_02         Hey, did you know that our daily energy expenditure (total expenditure) changes throughout our life course? A recent study analyzed a large, diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 years. They found that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identified four distinct metabolic life stages. \\n\\nThe first stage is neonates (0-1yr), where fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr. The second stage is childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr), where fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure declines slowly to adult levels at ~20 yr. The third stage is adulthood (20-60 yr), where fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure remains stable even during pregnancy. The final stage is older adults (60+ yr), where fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure declines. \\n\\nThese changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.  \n",

Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr).

Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\n",
    " = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\n",
    " = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\n",
    " = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\n",
    " = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.\n",

    "Total daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\n",

       "      <td>Hey, did you know that a recent study found that mild hypohydration, or a state of slight dehydration, can increase pain sensitivity in women? The study involved 14 women and found that hypohydration reduced pain tolerance by 34 seconds and increased ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness. What's interesting is that this effect was not influenced by menstrual phase. The study also found that acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity but did reduce thirst perception. It's pretty fascinating to see how hydration levels can affect pain perception in women.</td>\n",

They used a large and diverse database of both males and females from 8 days old to 95 years old. They found that our total expenditure is strongly related to fat-free mass in a power-law manner and identified four distinct metabolic life stages. The first stage is neonates (0-1yr), where daily expenditure accelerates rapidly to about 46% above adult values at around 1 year. Then, throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr), it declines slowly to adult levels at around 20 years old. In adulthood (20-60 yr), it remains stable even during pregnancy. But in older adults (60+ yr), it declines again. These findings could help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.</td>\n",

Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain.

We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration.

       "text           Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women \\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.\\n   \n",

What's interesting is that this effect was not influenced by menstrual phase. The study also found that acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity but did reduce thirst perception. It's pretty fascinating to see how hydration levels can affect pain perception in women.   \n",

The study showed that 24 hours of fluid restriction led to reduced pain tolerance by 34 seconds and increased ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness by 0.7 cm each. Interestingly, the study found that this effect was not influenced by menstrual phase. While acute water ingestion reduced thirst perception, it did not reduce pain sensitivity. This suggests that pain treatments may need to consider hydration levels as a factor in pain management.   \n",
       "text           Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women \\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity.

       "text           Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n   \n",

For example, in neonates (0-1 yr), daily expenditure accelerates rapidly to 46% above adult values at 1 year, then declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) before stabilizing at adult levels at around 20 years. Daily expenditure remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, but declines in older adults (60+ yr).

They used a large and diverse database of both males and females from 8 days old to 95 years old. They found that our total expenditure is strongly related to fat-free mass in a power-law manner and identified four distinct metabolic life stages. The first stage is neonates (0-1yr), where daily expenditure accelerates rapidly to about 46% above adult values at around 1 year. Then, throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr), it declines slowly to adult levels at around 20 years old. In adulthood (20-60 yr), it remains stable even during pregnancy. But in older adults (60+ yr), it declines again. These findings could help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.  \n",
       "text           Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n  \n",

They also found out that we go through four different stages in our life where we use different amounts of energy. When we are babies, we use a lot of energy, but then it goes down as we get older. When we are adults, it stays the same, even if we are pregnant. But when we get really old, it goes down again. This information can help us make better choices about what we eat and how we take care of our health as we grow up.</td>\n",

       "text                Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women \\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.\\n   \n",

This happens whether they are on their period or not. Compared to when they drink enough water, their pain tolerance goes down by about 34 seconds, and the pain feels worse by about 0.7 centimeters. Drinking water doesn't make the pain go away, but it does make you less thirsty. This study helps us understand how different things can affect how much pain we feel, like how much water we drink and where we are in our menstrual cycle.   \n",

The study involved 14 women who have regular periods and found that they could tolerate pain for 34 seconds less than usual and felt more pain than usual. Drinking water didn't help reduce the pain, but it did make them less thirsty. This study is important because it shows that pain is affected by many things, including how much water we drink.   \n",

They looked at a lot of information and found that having more muscle makes us need more energy. When we are babies, we need a lot of energy, but as we grow up, we need less and less until we become adults. When we get older, we need even less energy than when we were adults. This information can help us make better choices about what we eat and how we take care of our bodies as we grow up.   \n",

They looked at a lot of information and found that there are four different times in life when our bodies use energy differently. When we are babies, we need a lot of energy, but as we grow up, we need less and less until we become adults. When we get older, we need even less energy than we did when we were adults. This information is important for people to know so they can make sure they eat the right foods and stay healthy at every age.   \n",

They looked at a lot of information from boys and girls who were 8 days old to 95 years old. They found out that how much energy we use is related to how much muscle we have in our body. They also found out that we go through four different stages in our life where we use different amounts of energy. When we are babies, we use a lot of energy, but then it goes down as we get older. When we are adults, it stays the same, even if we are pregnant. But when we get really old, it goes down again. This information can help us make better choices about what we eat and how we take care of our health as we grow up.   \n",

The study showed that 24 hours of fluid restriction led to reduced pain tolerance by 34 seconds and increased ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness by 0.7 cm each. Interestingly, the study found that this effect was not influenced by menstrual phase. While acute water ingestion reduced thirst perception, it did not reduce pain sensitivity. This suggests that pain treatments may need to consider hydration levels as a factor in pain management.   \n",
       "text                Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women \\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.\\n   \n",

       "text                Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n   \n",

They used a large and diverse database of both males and females from 8 days old to 95 years old. They found that our total expenditure is strongly related to fat-free mass in a power-law manner and identified four distinct metabolic life stages. The first stage is neonates (0-1yr), where daily expenditure accelerates rapidly to about 46% above adult values at around 1 year. Then, throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr), it declines slowly to adult levels at around 20 years old. In adulthood (20-60 yr), it remains stable even during pregnancy. But in older adults (60+ yr), it declines again. These findings could help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.  \n",
       "text                Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr).

Well, researchers analyzed a large database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 years and found some interesting things. Firstly, they found that total expenditure is strongly related to fat-free mass in a power-law manner. Secondly, they identified four distinct metabolic life stages. The first stage is in neonates (0-1yr) where fat-free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly to about 46% above adult values at around 1 year. The second stage is throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr), where fat-free mass-adjusted daily expenditure declines slowly to adult levels at around 20 years. The third stage is in adulthood (20-60 yr), where fat-free mass-adjusted daily expenditure remains stable even during pregnancy. Lastly, the fourth stage is in older adults (60+ yr), where fat-free mass-adjusted daily expenditure declines. These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.</td>\n",

       "text           Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women \\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.\\n   \n",

       "text           Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women \\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity.

Fat-free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates to 46% above adult values at 1 year, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence to adult levels at 20 years, remains stable in adulthood even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults.

       "text           Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n   \n",

They found that total energy expenditure is strongly related to fat-free mass in a power-law manner and identified four distinct metabolic life stages. The study showed that energy expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates to 46% above adult values at around 1 year, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence to adult levels at around 20 years, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 years) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ years).

       "response_02    Hey, did you know that the total daily energy expenditure is a critical variable in human health and physiology, but it's unclear how it changes over the life course? Well, researchers analyzed a large database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 years and found some interesting things. Firstly, they found that total expenditure is strongly related to fat-free mass in a power-law manner. Secondly, they identified four distinct metabolic life stages. The first stage is in neonates (0-1yr) where fat-free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly to about 46% above adult values at around 1 year. The second stage is throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr), where fat-free mass-adjusted daily expenditure declines slowly to adult levels at around 20 years. The third stage is in adulthood (20-60 yr), where fat-free mass-adjusted daily expenditure remains stable even during pregnancy. Lastly, the fourth stage is in older adults (60+ yr), where fat-free mass-adjusted daily expenditure declines. These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.  \n",

Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n  \n",

Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase.

       "text           Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women \\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.\\n   \n",

I just read an interesting study that found that mild dehydration can increase pain sensitivity in women. The study involved 14 women who were restricted from fluids for 24 hours, and they found that pain tolerance was reduced by 34 seconds and pain intensity and unpleasantness increased by 0.7 cm. These effects were not influenced by menstrual phase. Interestingly, acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity, but it did reduce thirst perception. So, it seems that hydration levels may play a role in pain perception, particularly in women.   \n",
       "text           Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women \\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity.

       "text           Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n   \n",

Did you know that researchers analyzed a large database of human energy expenditure from people aged 8 days to 95 years old? They found that daily energy expenditure is strongly related to fat-free mass and identified four distinct metabolic life stages. Interestingly, they found that energy expenditure in neonates (0-1 year) accelerates rapidly to 46% above adult values and then slowly declines throughout childhood and adolescence to reach adult levels at 20 years old. Furthermore, energy expenditure remains stable in adulthood (20-60 years old) and declines in older adults (60+ years old). These findings shed new light on human development and aging and could help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.  \n",

In neonates (0-1 yr), daily expenditure accelerates rapidly to 46% above adult values at 1 year, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at 20 years old, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr).

       "text           Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n  \n",

They looked at people from when they were babies to when they were really old. They found that how much energy you use is related to how much muscle you have and that there are four different stages of how our bodies use energy. It's interesting because babies use a lot of energy, more than grown-ups, but then it goes down as they get older. When you're a grown-up, it stays the same, but when you get really old, it goes down again. This information can help us make better choices about what we eat and how we take care of our bodies throughout our lives.\",\n",

They found that daily energy expenditure is strongly related to fat-free mass and identified four distinct metabolic life stages. The first stage is in neonates, where energy expenditure accelerates rapidly to 46% above adult values at 1 year old. Then, energy expenditure declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence to adult levels at around 20 years old. In adulthood, energy expenditure remains stable even during pregnancy, but it declines in older adults aged 60 and above.

Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase.

       "text           Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women \\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.\\n   \n",

       "text           Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women \\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity.

       "text           Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n   \n",

They found that daily energy expenditure is strongly related to fat-free mass and identified four distinct metabolic life stages. The first stage is in neonates, where energy expenditure accelerates rapidly to 46% above adult values at 1 year old. Then, energy expenditure declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence to adult levels at around 20 years old. In adulthood, energy expenditure remains stable even during pregnancy, but it declines in older adults aged 60 and above. These findings shed new light on human development and aging and have important implications for nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.  \n",

They found that daily energy needs, or total daily energy expenditure, increases rapidly in infants and declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence, reaching adult levels around age 20. Interestingly, daily expenditure remains stable in adulthood, even during pregnancy, but declines in older adults over age 60. This sheds new light on human development and aging and can help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.  \n",
       "text           Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n  \n",

They looked at a lot of information about people from when they were just born to when they were 95 years old. They found that there are four different times in our lives when our bodies use energy in different ways. When we are babies, we use a lot of energy, but as we get older, we use less. This information can help us make better choices about what we eat and how we take care of our bodies as we grow up.</td>\n",

They found that how much energy you use is related to how much muscle you have and that there are four different stages of how much energy you use in your life. When you're a baby, you use a lot of energy, but then it goes down as you grow up. When you're an adult, it stays about the same, but when you get really old, it goes down again. This is important for knowing how to eat healthy and stay healthy throughout your life.</td>\n",

They found that babies need a lot of energy, but as we get older, we need less and less until we're grown-ups. Grown-ups need about the same amount of energy every day, even when they're having a baby. But when people get really old, they need less energy again.

       "text                Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women \\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.\\n   \n",

This is true no matter what time of the month it is. The study looked at 14 women who have regular periods. They were asked not to drink water for a whole day. After that, they felt more pain and it was harder to tolerate. Drinking water didn't make the pain go away, but it did make them less thirsty. This means that drinking enough water is important for managing pain.   \n",

They identified four different stages of life where our bodies use energy differently. When we are babies, we use a lot of energy compared to adults. As we grow up, we use less energy until we become adults. Even when women are pregnant, their energy use stays the same. But as we get older, we start to use less energy again. This information can help us make better choices about what we eat and how we take care of our bodies.   \n",

They looked at a lot of information about people from when they were just born to when they were 95 years old. They found that there are four different times in our lives when our bodies use energy in different ways. When we are babies, we use a lot of energy, but as we get older, we use less. This information can help us make better choices about what we eat and how we take care of our bodies as we grow up.   \n",

They looked at people from when they were babies to when they were really old. They found that how much energy you use is related to how much muscle you have and that there are four different stages of how much energy you use in your life. When you're a baby, you use a lot of energy, but then it goes down as you grow up. When you're an adult, it stays about the same, but when you get really old, it goes down again. This is important for knowing how to eat healthy and stay healthy throughout your life.   \n",

       "text                Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women \\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.\\n   \n",

       "text                Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n   \n",

The first stage is in neonates, where energy expenditure accelerates rapidly to 46% above adult values at 1 year old. Then, energy expenditure declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence to adult levels at around 20 years old. In adulthood, energy expenditure remains stable even during pregnancy, but it declines in older adults aged 60 and above.

They found that daily energy needs, or total daily energy expenditure, increases rapidly in infants and declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence, reaching adult levels around age 20. Interestingly, daily expenditure remains stable in adulthood, even during pregnancy, but declines in older adults over age 60. This sheds new light on human development and aging and can help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.  \n",
       "text                Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr).

       "      <td>Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n</td>\n",

       "text           Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women \\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.\\n   \n",

       "text           Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women \\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity.

       "text           Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n   \n",

They found that daily energy expenditure is strongly related to fat-free mass and identified four distinct metabolic life stages. The first stage is in neonates, where energy expenditure accelerates rapidly to 46% above adult values at 1 year old. Then, energy expenditure declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence to adult levels at around 20 years old. In adulthood, energy expenditure remains stable even during pregnancy, but it declines in older adults aged 60 and above. These findings shed new light on human development and aging and have important implications for nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.  \n",

They found that daily energy needs, or total daily energy expenditure, increases rapidly in infants and declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence, reaching adult levels around age 20. Interestingly, daily expenditure remains stable in adulthood, even during pregnancy, but declines in older adults over age 60. This sheds new light on human development and aging and can help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.  \n",
       "text           Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n  \n",

They found that how much energy you use is related to how much muscle you have and that there are four different stages of how much energy you use in your life. When you're a baby, you use a lot of energy, but then it goes down as you grow up. When you're an adult, it stays about the same, but when you get really old, it goes down again. This is important for knowing how to eat healthy and stay healthy throughout your life.  \n",

       "text           Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women \\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.\\n   \n",

       "text           Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women \\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity.

       "text           Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n   \n",

They found that daily energy expenditure is strongly related to fat-free mass and identified four distinct metabolic life stages. The first stage is in neonates, where energy expenditure accelerates rapidly to 46% above adult values at 1 year old. Then, energy expenditure declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence to adult levels at around 20 years old. In adulthood, energy expenditure remains stable even during pregnancy, but it declines in older adults aged 60 and above. These findings shed new light on human development and aging and have important implications for nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.  \n",

They found that daily energy needs, or total daily energy expenditure, increases rapidly in infants and declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence, reaching adult levels around age 20. Interestingly, daily expenditure remains stable in adulthood, even during pregnancy, but declines in older adults over age 60. This sheds new light on human development and aging and can help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.  \n",
       "text           Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n  \n",

Fat-free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates to 46% above adult values at 1 year, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence, remains stable in adulthood even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults. These findings shed new light on human development and aging and should inform nutrition and health strategies. #humanhealth #physiology #nutrition #healthstrategies</td>\n",
       "      <td>Hey, did you know that a recent study analyzed a large database of energy expenditure in humans of all ages, from 8 days to 95 years old? They found that daily energy expenditure is strongly related to fat-free mass and identified four distinct metabolic life stages. The first stage is in neonates, where energy expenditure accelerates rapidly to 46% above adult values at 1 year old. Then, energy expenditure declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence to adult levels at around 20 years old. In adulthood, energy expenditure remains stable even during pregnancy, but it declines in older adults aged 60 and above. These findings shed new light on human development and aging and have important implications for nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.</td>\n",

A study of 14 eumenorrheic women found that fluid restriction for 24 hours reduced pain tolerance by 34 seconds and increased pain intensity and unpleasantness. Acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity but did reduce thirst perception.

A recent study found that compared to being adequately hydrated, a 24-hour fluid restriction reduced pain tolerance by 34 seconds and increased ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness. Interestingly, this effect was not influenced by the menstrual phase. The study also found that while water ingestion reduced thirst perception, it did not reduce pain sensitivity. Overall, this study highlights the importance of hydration for pain management, especially for women.</td>\n",

However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase.

       "text                Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women \\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.\\n   \n",

This is true no matter what time of the month it is. The study looked at 14 women who have regular periods. They were asked not to drink water for a whole day. After that, they felt more pain and it was harder to tolerate. Drinking water didn't make the pain go away, but it did make them less thirsty. This means that drinking enough water is important for managing pain.   \n",

They identified four different stages of life where our bodies use energy differently. When we are babies, we use a lot of energy compared to adults. As we grow up, we use less energy until we become adults. Even when women are pregnant, their energy use stays the same. But as we get older, we start to use less energy again. This information can help us make better choices about what we eat and how we take care of our bodies.   \n",

They looked at a lot of information about people from when they were just born to when they were 95 years old. They found that there are four different times in our lives when our bodies use energy in different ways. When we are babies, we use a lot of energy, but as we get older, we use less. This information can help us make better choices about what we eat and how we take care of our bodies as we grow up.   \n",

They looked at people from when they were babies to when they were really old. They found that how much energy you use is related to how much muscle you have and that there are four different stages of how much energy you use in your life. When you're a baby, you use a lot of energy, but then it goes down as you grow up. When you're an adult, it stays about the same, but when you get really old, it goes down again. This is important for knowing how to eat healthy and stay healthy throughout your life.   \n",

Drinking water after this didn't help reduce the pain. This study is important for understanding how important it is to drink enough water for our health.   \n",

This is true no matter what time of the month it is. The study looked at 14 women who have regular periods. They were asked to drink less water for a day. After that, they felt more pain and it was harder to tolerate. Drinking water didn't make the pain go away, but it did make them less thirsty. This means that drinking enough water might help with pain.   \n",

       "text                Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women \\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.\\n   \n",

A study found that when women didn't drink enough water for a whole day, they could only handle pain for 34 seconds less than when they were drinking enough water. They also said the pain felt worse and was more unpleasant. This happened no matter what time of the month it was. Drinking water didn't make the pain go away, but it did make them less thirsty. So, it's really important for women to drink enough water to help manage their pain.   \n",

       "text                Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n   \n",

They identified four different stages of life where our bodies use energy differently. When we are babies, we use a lot of energy compared to adults. As we grow up, we use less energy until we become adults. Even when women are pregnant, their energy use stays the same. But as we get older, we start to use less energy again. This information can help us make better choices about what we eat and how we take care of our bodies.   \n",

They looked at a lot of information about people from when they were just born to when they were 95 years old. They found that there are four different times in our lives when our bodies use energy in different ways. When we are babies, we use a lot of energy, but as we get older, we use less.

They found that daily energy expenditure is strongly related to fat-free mass and identified four distinct metabolic life stages. The first stage is in neonates, where energy expenditure accelerates rapidly to 46% above adult values at 1 year old. Then, energy expenditure declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence to adult levels at around 20 years old. In adulthood, energy expenditure remains stable even during pregnancy, but it declines in older adults aged 60 and above. These findings shed new light on human development and aging and have important implications for nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.  \n",

They found that daily energy needs, or total daily energy expenditure, increases rapidly in infants and declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence, reaching adult levels around age 20. Interestingly, daily expenditure remains stable in adulthood, even during pregnancy, but declines in older adults over age 60. This sheds new light on human development and aging and can help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.  \n",
       "text                Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n  \n",

They looked at people from when they were babies to when they were really old. They found that how much energy you use is related to how much muscle you have and that there are four different stages of how much energy you use in your life. When you're a baby, you use a lot of energy, but then it goes down as you grow up. When you're an adult, it stays about the same, but when you get really old, it goes down again. This is important for knowing how to eat healthy and stay healthy throughout your life.  \n",

They found that babies need a lot of energy, but as we get older, we need less and less until we're grown-ups. Grown-ups need about the same amount of energy every day, even when they're having a baby. But when people get really old, they need less energy again. This information can help us make good choices about what we eat and how we take care of our bodies as we grow up and get older.  \n",

We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration.

       "text                Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women \\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.\\n   \n",

A recent study found that compared to being well hydrated, hypohydration (24 hours of fluid restriction) reduced pain tolerance by 34 seconds and increased ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness. This effect was seen in both early follicular and mid-luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. However, acute water ingestion did not reverse the negative effects of dehydration on pain sensitivity. Pretty interesting, right?   \n",

A recent study found that compared to being adequately hydrated, a 24-hour fluid restriction reduced pain tolerance by 34 seconds and increased ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness. Interestingly, this effect was not influenced by the menstrual phase. The study also found that while water ingestion reduced thirst perception, it did not reduce pain sensitivity. Overall, this study highlights the importance of hydration for pain management, especially for women.   \n",
       "text                Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women \\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.\\n   \n",

       "text                Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n   \n",

The first stage is in neonates, where energy expenditure accelerates rapidly to 46% above adult values at 1 year old. Then, energy expenditure declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence to adult levels at around 20 years old. In adulthood, energy expenditure remains stable even during pregnancy, but it declines in older adults aged 60 and above.

They found that daily energy needs, or total daily energy expenditure, increases rapidly in infants and declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence, reaching adult levels around age 20. Interestingly, daily expenditure remains stable in adulthood, even during pregnancy, but declines in older adults over age 60. This sheds new light on human development and aging and can help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.  \n",
       "text                Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr).

A recent study found that compared to being well hydrated, hypohydration (24 hours of fluid restriction) reduced pain tolerance by 34 seconds and increased ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness. This effect was seen in both early follicular and mid-luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. However, acute water ingestion did not reverse the negative effects of dehydration on pain sensitivity.

       "      <td>Hey, did you know that a recent study analyzed a large database of energy expenditure in humans of all ages, from 8 days to 95 years old? They found that daily energy expenditure is strongly related to fat-free mass and identified four distinct metabolic life stages. The first stage is in neonates, where energy expenditure accelerates rapidly to 46% above adult values at 1 year old. Then, energy expenditure declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence to adult levels at around 20 years old. In adulthood, energy expenditure remains stable even during pregnancy, but it declines in older adults aged 60 and above. These findings shed new light on human development and aging and have important implications for nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hey, did you know that a recent study analyzed daily energy expenditure across the human lifespan? They found that daily energy needs, or total daily energy expenditure, increases rapidly in infants and declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence, reaching adult levels around age 20. Interestingly, daily expenditure remains stable in adulthood, even during pregnancy, but declines in older adults over age 60. This sheds new light on human development and aging and can help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women \\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P &lt; 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n</td>\n",

In a sample of 14 eumenorrheic women, 24 hours of fluid restriction reduced pain tolerance by 34±46 seconds and increased pain intensity and unpleasantness. Acute water ingestion did not reverse the negative effects of hypohydration on pain sensitivity. #PainResearch #Hydration #Women'sHealth\"   \n",

A study of 14 eumenorrheic women found that fluid restriction for 24 hours reduced pain tolerance by 34 seconds and increased pain intensity and unpleasantness. Acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity but did reduce thirst perception. These findings suggest that hydration may play a role in pain management. #hydration #painsensitivity #womenhealth #research   \n",
       "text           Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women \\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.\\n   \n",

       "text           Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women \\n\\nChronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in part, to the multifactorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared with euhydration, HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, η2p\\n = 0.37) and increased ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; η2p\\n = 0.55) and unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; η2p\\n = 0.40); these results were not influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (visual analog scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, η2p\\n = 0.88) but did not reduce pain sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no influence of menstrual phase.\\n   \n",

       "text           Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n   \n",

They found that daily energy expenditure is strongly related to fat-free mass and identified four distinct metabolic life stages. The first stage is in neonates, where energy expenditure accelerates rapidly to 46% above adult values at 1 year old. Then, energy expenditure declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence to adult levels at around 20 years old. In adulthood, energy expenditure remains stable even during pregnancy, but it declines in older adults aged 60 and above. These findings shed new light on human development and aging and have important implications for nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.  \n",

They found that daily energy needs, or total daily energy expenditure, increases rapidly in infants and declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence, reaching adult levels around age 20. Interestingly, daily expenditure remains stable in adulthood, even during pregnancy, but declines in older adults over age 60. This sheds new light on human development and aging and can help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.  \n",
       "text           Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n\\nTotal daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.\\n  \n",

Mild hypohydration was shown to increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17β-estradiol and progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman’s pain sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild hypohydration (HYPO, 24 h of fluid restriction) on ischemic pain sensitivity in 14 eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration.
