Adjusted expenditures for pregnant mothers and neonates remain stable at ~100%, while total and basal expenditures accelerate rapidly over the first year and progressively decline thereafter, reaching adult levels at ~20 years. Elevated tissue-specific metabolism in early life may be related to growth or development, while reduced expenditures in later life may reflect a decline in organ level metabolism. There is considerable metabolic variation among individuals, with TEE and its components varying more than ±20% even when controlling for body composition, sex, and age. These findings have implications for understanding energy balance, nutritional needs, body weight, and potential clinical investigations into disease, pharmaceutical activity, and healing.\" #metabolism #lifecourse #healthresearch</td>\n",

They found that there are major changes in metabolic rate across our lifespan. For instance, after rapid acceleration in total and basal expenditure during the first year, adjusted expenditures progressively decline thereafter, reaching adult levels at around 20 years old. Additionally, they found that tissue-specific metabolic rates are elevated in children and adolescents by around 50% compared to adults, and are about 25% lower in the oldest subjects. Furthermore, there is considerable metabolic variation among individuals, with total energy expenditure varying more than ± 20% even when controlling for fat-free mass, fat mass, sex, and age.

       "      <td>Hey, did you know that high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen can compromise muscle strength and hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young adults? A study showed that the maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen compromised muscle hypertrophy independent of training mode, and increased muscle strength was attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The study found that the negative effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake, and there may be distinct differences in the response to resistance training and NSAID consumption in the young vs. the elderly. This study provides strong proof-of-principle evidence that the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake.</td>\n",

Menstrual phase, on the other hand, does not appear to affect pain sensitivity. The study also found that acute water ingestion did not immediately reverse the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration.

Interestingly, acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity, despite decreasing thirst perception. These findings suggest that inadequate hydration may worsen pain perception in women, and could have implications for chronic pain conditions.

Adjusted expenditures for pregnant mothers and neonates remain stable at ~100%, while total and basal expenditures accelerate rapidly over the first year and progressively decline thereafter, reaching adult levels at ~20 years. Elevated tissue-specific metabolism in early life may be related to growth or development, while reduced expenditures in later life may reflect a decline in organ level metabolism. There is considerable metabolic variation among individuals, with TEE and its components varying more than ±20% even when controlling for body composition, sex, and age.

       "response_01                   Hey, did you know that a recent study investigated daily energy expenditure throughout the human life course? They found that there are major changes in metabolic rate across our lifespan. For instance, after rapid acceleration in total and basal expenditure during the first year, adjusted expenditures progressively decline thereafter, reaching adult levels at around 20 years old. Additionally, they found that tissue-specific metabolic rates are elevated in children and adolescents by around 50% compared to adults, and are about 25% lower in the oldest subjects. Furthermore, there is considerable metabolic variation among individuals, with total energy expenditure varying more than ± 20% even when controlling for fat-free mass, fat mass, sex, and age. These findings could have implications for understanding health and disease.   \n",

       "response_01                   Hey, did you know that high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen can compromise muscle strength and hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young adults? A study showed that the maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen compromised muscle hypertrophy independent of training mode, and increased muscle strength was attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The study found that the negative effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake, and there may be distinct differences in the response to resistance training and NSAID consumption in the young vs. the elderly. This study provides strong proof-of-principle evidence that the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake.   \n",

       "response_01                   New research suggests that mild hypohydration, caused by insufficient water intake, increases pain sensitivity in women. Menstrual phase, on the other hand, does not appear to affect pain sensitivity. The study also found that acute water ingestion did not immediately reverse the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration. These findings have implications for chronic pain management and the need to maintain adequate hydration. Pain researchers should also consider controlling or measuring hydration status to minimize confounds in their studies.   \n",

       "      <td>Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nThis study examined the independent and combined effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in healthy eumenorrheic women, and the potential efficacy of acute water ingestion as a remedy to the deleterious impact of hypohydration. The main findings were that: 1) mild hypohydration increased pain sensitivity, 2) menstrual phase did not affect pain sensitivity, nor did it influence the effect of hypohydration on pain, and 3) acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity.\\n\\nHypohydration and Pain in Women\\nIndependent of menstrual phase, mild hypohydration following 24 h of fluid restriction reduced pain tolerance (?8%) and increased pain intensity (+13%) and pain unpleasantness (+12%) ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (hereafter referred to as pain ratings) during ischemic pain stimulation, when compared with euhydration. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies that showed negative effects of mild hypohydration on experimental pain sensitivity in men (7, 8). Ogino et al. (7) observed a decrease in pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) following a combination of exercise-induced dehydration and fluid restriction, whereas Bear et al. (8) found an increase in pain intensity ratings but no difference in pain thresholds after 24 h of fluid restriction. Therefore, the current findings extend these previous results to women by showing that mild hypohydration also increases experimental pain sensitivity in women. The previous studies also did not include pain measures that reflect the affective/emotional experience of pain (i.e., pain tolerance or pain unpleasantness ratings) that may be important for chronic pain, whereas both pain threshold and pain intensity ratings assess the sensory/discriminative aspect of pain (49, 50). Although Bear et al. (8) measured pain tolerance, the nature of the stimulus-response relationship for the cold pressor taski.e., plateau and gradual decline in the perceived intensity of the pain stimulus (41)resulted in a large proportion (?2/3) of participants who were able to tolerate the pain until the 4-min cut-off time, thereby precluding meaningful analyses of the results. This issue was not apparent with the ischemic pain test used in the present study, as there was only one instance where the 20-min time limit was reached. Therefore, the current findings further add to the previous data by showing that mild hypohydration also negatively impacts the affective/emotional aspect of pain, as evidenced by the decrease in pain tolerance and increase in pain unpleasantness ratings compared with EUH.\\n\\nThe exact mechanisms underlying the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration cannot be determined from the current data. However, one potential mechanism through which hypohydration may increase pain sensitivity is thirst perception. Geuter et al. (51) showed that an increase in thirst perceptioninduced by consumption of salty snacks followed by 5 h of fluid deprivationled to an increase in pain intensity ratings during noxious heat stimulation, whereas subsequent ad libitum fluid intake, which reduced thirst perception, decreased pain ratings. In another study, stimulation of thirst sensation via hypertonic saline infusion increased pain intensity ratings during noxious pressure stimulation, which were associated with stronger activation of pain-related brain regions; namely, the anterior cingulate cortex and insula (52). Similar findings were reported in the study by Ogino et al. (7). These brain regions were previously shown to be activated and deactivated independently by an increase and decrease in thirst perception, respectively (5254). However, it is not apparent from these data whether the increased pain sensitivity and pain-related brain activity were due to thirst perception per se, physiological hypohydration, or both.\\n\\nMenstrual Phase and Experimental Pain Sensitivity\\nMenstrual phase did not modulate the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration, nor did it independently affect pain sensitivity. The lack of a menstrual phase effect on ischemic pain sensitivity is consistent with the findings of most previous studies that examined ischemic pain responses across the menstrual cycle (18, 5558). In contrast, studies by Fillingim et al. (59) and Pfleeger et al. (60) observed greater pain sensitivity during the luteal compared with follicular phase. However, concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone were not measured in the study by Pfleeger et al. (60), whereas the specific definition of the luteal phase used by Fillingim et al. (59) differed from that in the current study. We examined the ML phase when concentrations of both 17?-estradiol and progesterone are elevated, whereas Fillingim et al. (59) included the late-luteal period in their classification of the luteal phase, during which concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone are declining rapidly and are less stable compared with the ML phase. Given that menstrual phases characterized by fluctuating or unstable 17?-estradiol levels have been associated with increased severity of various chronic pain conditions (14), this may explain why Fillingim et al. (59) observed phase differences in pain sensitivity whereas we did not.\\n\\nThe equivocal and inconclusive results regarding menstrual phase effects on experimental pain sensitivity are thought to be due, in part, to the lack of proper verification of menstrual phases through blood measurements of 17?-estradiol and progesterone (15, 16), making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relationship between menstrual phase/hormone status and pain sensitivity. Similar to previous observations (22, 23), Sosm was lower in the ML than EF phase (Table 2); however, this phase difference in hydration did not appear to impact any of the ischemic pain measures (Figs. 13). In this study, we showed that after hydration status was controlled, menstrual phases were properly verified and potential confounders (e.g., dietary and lifestyle factors and dysmenorrhea) were minimized, there was no difference in ischemic pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases. As such, our data suggest that the hormonal fluctuations within the menstrual cycle do not greatly impact pain sensitivity.\\n\\nInterestingly, although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phase, there was a positive correlation between 17?-estradiol and pain sensitivity, suggesting that women with higher baseline levels of 17?-estradiol may be more sensitive to pain than those with lower 17?-estradiol levels (i.e., between-subject effect). However, given the weak strength of the correlation (r = ?0.32) (48), this finding should be interpreted with caution.\\n\\nEffects of Acute Water Ingestion\\nGiven that thirst perception may be a potential mechanism linking hypohydration and increased pain sensitivity, we hypothesized that acute water ingestion when hypohydrated would reduce pain sensitivity. This would also help to delineate the effects of thirst and hypohydration per se, on pain, since acute water ingestion would be expected to reduce thirst without altering hydration status (38, 61). However, contrary to our hypothesis, ischemic pain tolerance was not affected by ingestion of 5 mL·kg?1 of water, despite the significant decrease in thirst perception ratings. Meanwhile, ratings of both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness increased, which may appear counterintuitive as participants reported feeling more pain despite being less thirsty. These unexpected findings may be explained by carryover (sensitization) effects from the baseline pain test. A previous study showed that repeated pain stimulation within a single session produced a sensitization effect, whereby pain ratings increased gradually with each repeated stimulation (62). Therefore, this sensitization effect may have masked potential positive effects of acute water ingestion on pain. Future studies that either utilize a longer interval between the repeated pain tests, or perform the postwater ingestion pain test on a separate day, are required to gain further understanding on the relative importance of thirst perception and physiological hypohydration on pain.\\n\\nConsiderations\\nThere are several considerations and limitations of this study that should be noted in addition to those already discussed earlier. First, only healthy, eumenorrheic women were included in this study, which ignores postmenopausal women and oral contraceptive pill users, who have different hormonal profiles compared with eumenorrheic women. Therefore, it is possible that hypohydration may affect pain sensitivity differently in these women compared with eumenorrheic women. Second, blood samples were not obtained after water ingestion to confirm that hydration status was not altered. However, previous data indicate that consuming a moderate volume of water, similar to that in the current study, does not acutely alter hydration status in hypohydrated men (38, 61). In addition, the relatively short interval of 30 min between water ingestion and the subsequent pain test was likely insufficient for hydration status to be altered, because a previous study showed that at least 75 min is required for 300 mL of water to be completely absorbed into the bloodstream (63). Third, as participants could not be blinded to the hydration intervention, the increased pain sensitivity observed during HYPO may have been confounded by nocebo effects (64, 65). Although participants were not aware of the study hypotheses, they were aware of the aims of the study, one of which was to investigate the effects of hypohydration on pain sensitivity. Given the negative connotations of hypohydration or dehydration, it is conceivable that participants would expect hypohydration to increase pain sensitivity, which may have subsequently influenced participants actual responses to the ischemic pain test. Fourth, the body mass change values in HYPO may not accurately reflect the fluid losses induced by the 24 h of fluid restriction. Due to the scheduling constraints that included two experimental visits within 3 days per menstrual phase, we were unable to obtain a baseline body mass at the start of the hydration intervention; thus, body mass change in HYPO was calculated using EUH body mass. As the EUH and HYPO trials within each menstrual phase were separated by at least 48 h, it is likely that the values were confounded by factors other than the change in body water content (e.g., urine and fecal losses, food and fluid consumption). Acknowledging this limitation, we obtained other measures of hydration status (i.e., Sosm, USG, copeptin, and thirst ratings) in addition to body mass change for a more accurate assessment of hydrations status. Finally, our sample size may have limited our ability to detect statistically significant menstrual phase effects on pain. As such, the effects of menstrual phase on pain require further investigation. Our study could provide a reference for future studies with a similar design to base their sample size calculations on. Nevertheless, large effect sizes (?2p\\n = 0.370.55) were obtained for the main effect of hypohydration on pain, with an observed power of 0.70.9, which suggests a low probability of false negatives.\\n\\nPerspectives and Significance\\nOur data indicate that hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women and this effect may not be reversed immediately by water ingestion. Whereas, menstrual phase (EF vs. ML) does not appear to affect pain sensitivity. These findings suggest that insufficient water intake throughout the day may exacerbate pain perception in healthy women. Given the high prevalence of hypohydration among the general population (25), future studies should investigate whether hypohydration may worsen chronic pain conditions, and the potential efficacy of maintaining adequate hydration in alleviating pain symptoms. This may be especially important for older adults, who are more likely to be hypohydrated and experience chronic pain (25, 66). For human pain researchers, controlling or measuring hydration status of participants may be important to minimize confound, as clinically and physiologically relevant tests such as the cold pressor are affected (67). Although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases after controlling for hydration status, more high-quality research is required to accurately determine whether menstrual phase does or does not affect pain sensitivity. Therefore, until a consensus on the topic has been reached, our data do not discount the need for future pain researchers to verify menstrual phase.\\n\\n</td>\n",

Menstrual phase, on the other hand, does not appear to affect pain sensitivity. The study also found that acute water ingestion did not immediately reverse the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration. These findings have implications for chronic pain management and the need to maintain adequate hydration. Pain researchers should also consider controlling or measuring hydration status to minimize confounds in their studies.   \n",

                              New study finds that mild hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women, while menstrual phase does not influence pain sensitivity. Acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity. These findings suggest that maintaining adequate hydration may alleviate pain symptoms, especially for those with chronic pain conditions. #Hydration #PainSensitivity #WomenHealth #ChronicPain   \n",

mild dehydration can increase pain sensitivity in healthy women, regardless of menstrual phase. The study found that thirst perception may be a potential mechanism linking dehydration and increased pain sensitivity. Surprisingly, acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity, despite decreasing thirst perception. These findings highlight the importance of adequate hydration in pain management and suggest that controlling or measuring hydration status may be important in human pain research. Further studies are needed to investigate the potential exacerbation of chronic pain conditions by hypohydration.   \n",

                                                 According to a recent study, mild hypohydration can increase pain sensitivity in healthy women, regardless of their menstrual phase. The study also found that acute water ingestion did not immediately reduce pain sensitivity. These findings suggest that maintaining adequate hydration may help alleviate pain symptoms in women and should be further investigated for its potential impact on chronic pain conditions. Pain researchers should also consider controlling or measuring hydration status to minimize confound in clinically and physiologically relevant tests.   \n",

       "text           Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nThis study examined the independent and combined effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in healthy eumenorrheic women, and the potential efficacy of acute water ingestion as a remedy to the deleterious impact of hypohydration. The main findings were that: 1) mild hypohydration increased pain sensitivity, 2) menstrual phase did not affect pain sensitivity, nor did it influence the effect of hypohydration on pain, and 3) acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity.\\n\\nHypohydration and Pain in Women\\nIndependent of menstrual phase, mild hypohydration following 24 h of fluid restriction reduced pain tolerance (?8%) and increased pain intensity (+13%) and pain unpleasantness (+12%) ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (hereafter referred to as pain ratings) during ischemic pain stimulation, when compared with euhydration. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies that showed negative effects of mild hypohydration on experimental pain sensitivity in men (7, 8). Ogino et al. (7) observed a decrease in pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) following a combination of exercise-induced dehydration and fluid restriction, whereas Bear et al. (8) found an increase in pain intensity ratings but no difference in pain thresholds after 24 h of fluid restriction. Therefore, the current findings extend these previous results to women by showing that mild hypohydration also increases experimental pain sensitivity in women. The previous studies also did not include pain measures that reflect the affective/emotional experience of pain (i.e., pain tolerance or pain unpleasantness ratings) that may be important for chronic pain, whereas both pain threshold and pain intensity ratings assess the sensory/discriminative aspect of pain (49, 50). Although Bear et al. (8) measured pain tolerance, the nature of the stimulus-response relationship for the cold pressor taski.e., plateau and gradual decline in the perceived intensity of the pain stimulus (41)resulted in a large proportion (?2/3) of participants who were able to tolerate the pain until the 4-min cut-off time, thereby precluding meaningful analyses of the results. This issue was not apparent with the ischemic pain test used in the present study, as there was only one instance where the 20-min time limit was reached. Therefore, the current findings further add to the previous data by showing that mild hypohydration also negatively impacts the affective/emotional aspect of pain, as evidenced by the decrease in pain tolerance and increase in pain unpleasantness ratings compared with EUH.\\n\\nThe exact mechanisms underlying the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration cannot be determined from the current data. However, one potential mechanism through which hypohydration may increase pain sensitivity is thirst perception. Geuter et al. (51) showed that an increase in thirst perceptioninduced by consumption of salty snacks followed by 5 h of fluid deprivationled to an increase in pain intensity ratings during noxious heat stimulation, whereas subsequent ad libitum fluid intake, which reduced thirst perception, decreased pain ratings. In another study, stimulation of thirst sensation via hypertonic saline infusion increased pain intensity ratings during noxious pressure stimulation, which were associated with stronger activation of pain-related brain regions; namely, the anterior cingulate cortex and insula (52). Similar findings were reported in the study by Ogino et al. (7). These brain regions were previously shown to be activated and deactivated independently by an increase and decrease in thirst perception, respectively (5254). However, it is not apparent from these data whether the increased pain sensitivity and pain-related brain activity were due to thirst perception per se, physiological hypohydration, or both.\\n\\nMenstrual Phase and Experimental Pain Sensitivity\\nMenstrual phase did not modulate the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration, nor did it independently affect pain sensitivity. The lack of a menstrual phase effect on ischemic pain sensitivity is consistent with the findings of most previous studies that examined ischemic pain responses across the menstrual cycle (18, 5558). In contrast, studies by Fillingim et al. (59) and Pfleeger et al. (60) observed greater pain sensitivity during the luteal compared with follicular phase. However, concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone were not measured in the study by Pfleeger et al. (60), whereas the specific definition of the luteal phase used by Fillingim et al. (59) differed from that in the current study. We examined the ML phase when concentrations of both 17?-estradiol and progesterone are elevated, whereas Fillingim et al. (59) included the late-luteal period in their classification of the luteal phase, during which concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone are declining rapidly and are less stable compared with the ML phase. Given that menstrual phases characterized by fluctuating or unstable 17?-estradiol levels have been associated with increased severity of various chronic pain conditions (14), this may explain why Fillingim et al. (59) observed phase differences in pain sensitivity whereas we did not.\\n\\nThe equivocal and inconclusive results regarding menstrual phase effects on experimental pain sensitivity are thought to be due, in part, to the lack of proper verification of menstrual phases through blood measurements of 17?-estradiol and progesterone (15, 16), making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relationship between menstrual phase/hormone status and pain sensitivity. Similar to previous observations (22, 23), Sosm was lower in the ML than EF phase (Table 2); however, this phase difference in hydration did not appear to impact any of the ischemic pain measures (Figs. 13). In this study, we showed that after hydration status was controlled, menstrual phases were properly verified and potential confounders (e.g., dietary and lifestyle factors and dysmenorrhea) were minimized, there was no difference in ischemic pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases. As such, our data suggest that the hormonal fluctuations within the menstrual cycle do not greatly impact pain sensitivity.\\n\\nInterestingly, although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phase, there was a positive correlation between 17?-estradiol and pain sensitivity, suggesting that women with higher baseline levels of 17?-estradiol may be more sensitive to pain than those with lower 17?-estradiol levels (i.e., between-subject effect). However, given the weak strength of the correlation (r = ?0.32) (48), this finding should be interpreted with caution.\\n\\nEffects of Acute Water Ingestion\\nGiven that thirst perception may be a potential mechanism linking hypohydration and increased pain sensitivity, we hypothesized that acute water ingestion when hypohydrated would reduce pain sensitivity. This would also help to delineate the effects of thirst and hypohydration per se, on pain, since acute water ingestion would be expected to reduce thirst without altering hydration status (38, 61). However, contrary to our hypothesis, ischemic pain tolerance was not affected by ingestion of 5 mL·kg?1 of water, despite the significant decrease in thirst perception ratings. Meanwhile, ratings of both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness increased, which may appear counterintuitive as participants reported feeling more pain despite being less thirsty. These unexpected findings may be explained by carryover (sensitization) effects from the baseline pain test. A previous study showed that repeated pain stimulation within a single session produced a sensitization effect, whereby pain ratings increased gradually with each repeated stimulation (62). Therefore, this sensitization effect may have masked potential positive effects of acute water ingestion on pain. Future studies that either utilize a longer interval between the repeated pain tests, or perform the postwater ingestion pain test on a separate day, are required to gain further understanding on the relative importance of thirst perception and physiological hypohydration on pain.\\n\\nConsiderations\\nThere are several considerations and limitations of this study that should be noted in addition to those already discussed earlier. First, only healthy, eumenorrheic women were included in this study, which ignores postmenopausal women and oral contraceptive pill users, who have different hormonal profiles compared with eumenorrheic women. Therefore, it is possible that hypohydration may affect pain sensitivity differently in these women compared with eumenorrheic women. Second, blood samples were not obtained after water ingestion to confirm that hydration status was not altered. However, previous data indicate that consuming a moderate volume of water, similar to that in the current study, does not acutely alter hydration status in hypohydrated men (38, 61). In addition, the relatively short interval of 30 min between water ingestion and the subsequent pain test was likely insufficient for hydration status to be altered, because a previous study showed that at least 75 min is required for 300 mL of water to be completely absorbed into the bloodstream (63). Third, as participants could not be blinded to the hydration intervention, the increased pain sensitivity observed during HYPO may have been confounded by nocebo effects (64, 65). Although participants were not aware of the study hypotheses, they were aware of the aims of the study, one of which was to investigate the effects of hypohydration on pain sensitivity. Given the negative connotations of hypohydration or dehydration, it is conceivable that participants would expect hypohydration to increase pain sensitivity, which may have subsequently influenced participants actual responses to the ischemic pain test. Fourth, the body mass change values in HYPO may not accurately reflect the fluid losses induced by the 24 h of fluid restriction. Due to the scheduling constraints that included two experimental visits within 3 days per menstrual phase, we were unable to obtain a baseline body mass at the start of the hydration intervention; thus, body mass change in HYPO was calculated using EUH body mass. As the EUH and HYPO trials within each menstrual phase were separated by at least 48 h, it is likely that the values were confounded by factors other than the change in body water content (e.g., urine and fecal losses, food and fluid consumption). Acknowledging this limitation, we obtained other measures of hydration status (i.e., Sosm, USG, copeptin, and thirst ratings) in addition to body mass change for a more accurate assessment of hydrations status. Finally, our sample size may have limited our ability to detect statistically significant menstrual phase effects on pain. As such, the effects of menstrual phase on pain require further investigation. Our study could provide a reference for future studies with a similar design to base their sample size calculations on. Nevertheless, large effect sizes (?2p\\n = 0.370.55) were obtained for the main effect of hypohydration on pain, with an observed power of 0.70.9, which suggests a low probability of false negatives.\\n\\nPerspectives and Significance\\nOur data indicate that hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women and this effect may not be reversed immediately by water ingestion. Whereas, menstrual phase (EF vs. ML) does not appear to affect pain sensitivity. These findings suggest that insufficient water intake throughout the day may exacerbate pain perception in healthy women. Given the high prevalence of hypohydration among the general population (25), future studies should investigate whether hypohydration may worsen chronic pain conditions, and the potential efficacy of maintaining adequate hydration in alleviating pain symptoms. This may be especially important for older adults, who are more likely to be hypohydrated and experience chronic pain (25, 66). For human pain researchers, controlling or measuring hydration status of participants may be important to minimize confound, as clinically and physiologically relevant tests such as the cold pressor are affected (67). Although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases after controlling for hydration status, more high-quality research is required to accurately determine whether menstrual phase does or does not affect pain sensitivity. Therefore, until a consensus on the topic has been reached, our data do not discount the need for future pain researchers to verify menstrual phase.\\n\\n   \n",

I just read a study that found that mild dehydration can increase pain sensitivity in healthy women, regardless of their menstrual cycle phase. The study showed that pain tolerance decreased by 8%, while pain intensity and unpleasantness increased by 13% and 12%, respectively. Interestingly, acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity, despite decreasing thirst perception. These findings suggest that inadequate hydration may worsen pain perception in women, and could have implications for chronic pain conditions. It might be important for pain researchers to control for participants' hydration status in their studies.  \n",

                                   Hey, did you know that a new study found that hypohydration, or mild dehydration, can increase pain sensitivity in women? They found that after 24 hours of fluid restriction, pain tolerance decreased by 8% and pain intensity increased by 13% in women compared to when they were hydrated. Interestingly, menstrual phase did not affect pain sensitivity, but there was a positive correlation between 17?-estradiol levels and pain sensitivity. They also tested if acute water ingestion could remedy the negative effects of hypohydration on pain, but it did not reduce pain sensitivity. This study suggests that maintaining adequate hydration may be important in alleviating pain symptoms, especially for older adults who are more likely to be hypohydrated and experience chronic pain.  \n",

know that a study found that mild dehydration can increase pain sensitivity in women? The study also discovered that menstrual phase doesn't affect pain sensitivity. They tested pain tolerance, pain intensity, and pain unpleasantness ratings after a handgrip exercise. The results showed that pain tolerance decreased by 8%, while pain intensity increased by 13% and pain unpleasantness increased by 12%. Interestingly, acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity, even though it decreased thirst perception. The study also found that hormonal fluctuations within the menstrual cycle do not significantly impact pain sensitivity. This study provides valuable information on the effects of hydration on pain perception in women and raises the question of whether hypohydration worsens chronic pain conditions.  \n",

can increase pain sensitivity in women by 13%? And even though menstrual phase did not affect pain sensitivity, women with higher levels of 17?-estradiol may be more sensitive to pain. The study also tested whether drinking water could alleviate the pain, but it didn't seem to have an effect. This is important because it suggests that staying hydrated throughout the day may help reduce pain perception in women.  \n",

a study found that not drinking enough water can increase pain sensitivity in women? The study showed that mild hypohydration increased pain intensity by 13% and pain unpleasantness by 12% compared to being properly hydrated. Interestingly, menstrual phase did not affect pain sensitivity. The study also tested if drinking water could reduce pain sensitivity, but it did not have an immediate effect. This is important because many people are not properly hydrated and it could worsen chronic pain conditions. The study also highlights the importance of controlling or measuring hydration status in pain research.  \n",
       "text           Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nThis study examined the independent and combined effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in healthy eumenorrheic women, and the potential efficacy of acute water ingestion as a remedy to the deleterious impact of hypohydration. The main findings were that: 1) mild hypohydration increased pain sensitivity, 2) menstrual phase did not affect pain sensitivity, nor did it influence the effect of hypohydration on pain, and 3) acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity.\\n\\nHypohydration and Pain in Women\\nIndependent of menstrual phase, mild hypohydration following 24 h of fluid restriction reduced pain tolerance (?8%) and increased pain intensity (+13%) and pain unpleasantness (+12%) ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (hereafter referred to as pain ratings) during ischemic pain stimulation, when compared with euhydration. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies that showed negative effects of mild hypohydration on experimental pain sensitivity in men (7, 8). Ogino et al. (7) observed a decrease in pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) following a combination of exercise-induced dehydration and fluid restriction, whereas Bear et al. (8) found an increase in pain intensity ratings but no difference in pain thresholds after 24 h of fluid restriction. Therefore, the current findings extend these previous results to women by showing that mild hypohydration also increases experimental pain sensitivity in women. The previous studies also did not include pain measures that reflect the affective/emotional experience of pain (i.e., pain tolerance or pain unpleasantness ratings) that may be important for chronic pain, whereas both pain threshold and pain intensity ratings assess the sensory/discriminative aspect of pain (49, 50). Although Bear et al. (8) measured pain tolerance, the nature of the stimulus-response relationship for the cold pressor taski.e., plateau and gradual decline in the perceived intensity of the pain stimulus (41)resulted in a large proportion (?2/3) of participants who were able to tolerate the pain until the 4-min cut-off time, thereby precluding meaningful analyses of the results. This issue was not apparent with the ischemic pain test used in the present study, as there was only one instance where the 20-min time limit was reached. Therefore, the current findings further add to the previous data by showing that mild hypohydration also negatively impacts the affective/emotional aspect of pain, as evidenced by the decrease in pain tolerance and increase in pain unpleasantness ratings compared with EUH.\\n\\nThe exact mechanisms underlying the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration cannot be determined from the current data. However, one potential mechanism through which hypohydration may increase pain sensitivity is thirst perception. Geuter et al. (51) showed that an increase in thirst perceptioninduced by consumption of salty snacks followed by 5 h of fluid deprivationled to an increase in pain intensity ratings during noxious heat stimulation, whereas subsequent ad libitum fluid intake, which reduced thirst perception, decreased pain ratings. In another study, stimulation of thirst sensation via hypertonic saline infusion increased pain intensity ratings during noxious pressure stimulation, which were associated with stronger activation of pain-related brain regions; namely, the anterior cingulate cortex and insula (52). Similar findings were reported in the study by Ogino et al. (7). These brain regions were previously shown to be activated and deactivated independently by an increase and decrease in thirst perception, respectively (5254). However, it is not apparent from these data whether the increased pain sensitivity and pain-related brain activity were due to thirst perception per se, physiological hypohydration, or both.\\n\\nMenstrual Phase and Experimental Pain Sensitivity\\nMenstrual phase did not modulate the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration, nor did it independently affect pain sensitivity. The lack of a menstrual phase effect on ischemic pain sensitivity is consistent with the findings of most previous studies that examined ischemic pain responses across the menstrual cycle (18, 5558). In contrast, studies by Fillingim et al. (59) and Pfleeger et al. (60) observed greater pain sensitivity during the luteal compared with follicular phase. However, concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone were not measured in the study by Pfleeger et al. (60), whereas the specific definition of the luteal phase used by Fillingim et al. (59) differed from that in the current study. We examined the ML phase when concentrations of both 17?-estradiol and progesterone are elevated, whereas Fillingim et al. (59) included the late-luteal period in their classification of the luteal phase, during which concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone are declining rapidly and are less stable compared with the ML phase. Given that menstrual phases characterized by fluctuating or unstable 17?-estradiol levels have been associated with increased severity of various chronic pain conditions (14), this may explain why Fillingim et al. (59) observed phase differences in pain sensitivity whereas we did not.\\n\\nThe equivocal and inconclusive results regarding menstrual phase effects on experimental pain sensitivity are thought to be due, in part, to the lack of proper verification of menstrual phases through blood measurements of 17?-estradiol and progesterone (15, 16), making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relationship between menstrual phase/hormone status and pain sensitivity. Similar to previous observations (22, 23), Sosm was lower in the ML than EF phase (Table 2); however, this phase difference in hydration did not appear to impact any of the ischemic pain measures (Figs. 13). In this study, we showed that after hydration status was controlled, menstrual phases were properly verified and potential confounders (e.g., dietary and lifestyle factors and dysmenorrhea) were minimized, there was no difference in ischemic pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases. As such, our data suggest that the hormonal fluctuations within the menstrual cycle do not greatly impact pain sensitivity.\\n\\nInterestingly, although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phase, there was a positive correlation between 17?-estradiol and pain sensitivity, suggesting that women with higher baseline levels of 17?-estradiol may be more sensitive to pain than those with lower 17?-estradiol levels (i.e., between-subject effect). However, given the weak strength of the correlation (r = ?0.32) (48), this finding should be interpreted with caution.\\n\\nEffects of Acute Water Ingestion\\nGiven that thirst perception may be a potential mechanism linking hypohydration and increased pain sensitivity, we hypothesized that acute water ingestion when hypohydrated would reduce pain sensitivity. This would also help to delineate the effects of thirst and hypohydration per se, on pain, since acute water ingestion would be expected to reduce thirst without altering hydration status (38, 61). However, contrary to our hypothesis, ischemic pain tolerance was not affected by ingestion of 5 mL·kg?1 of water, despite the significant decrease in thirst perception ratings. Meanwhile, ratings of both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness increased, which may appear counterintuitive as participants reported feeling more pain despite being less thirsty. These unexpected findings may be explained by carryover (sensitization) effects from the baseline pain test. A previous study showed that repeated pain stimulation within a single session produced a sensitization effect, whereby pain ratings increased gradually with each repeated stimulation (62). Therefore, this sensitization effect may have masked potential positive effects of acute water ingestion on pain. Future studies that either utilize a longer interval between the repeated pain tests, or perform the postwater ingestion pain test on a separate day, are required to gain further understanding on the relative importance of thirst perception and physiological hypohydration on pain.\\n\\nConsiderations\\nThere are several considerations and limitations of this study that should be noted in addition to those already discussed earlier. First, only healthy, eumenorrheic women were included in this study, which ignores postmenopausal women and oral contraceptive pill users, who have different hormonal profiles compared with eumenorrheic women. Therefore, it is possible that hypohydration may affect pain sensitivity differently in these women compared with eumenorrheic women. Second, blood samples were not obtained after water ingestion to confirm that hydration status was not altered. However, previous data indicate that consuming a moderate volume of water, similar to that in the current study, does not acutely alter hydration status in hypohydrated men (38, 61). In addition, the relatively short interval of 30 min between water ingestion and the subsequent pain test was likely insufficient for hydration status to be altered, because a previous study showed that at least 75 min is required for 300 mL of water to be completely absorbed into the bloodstream (63). Third, as participants could not be blinded to the hydration intervention, the increased pain sensitivity observed during HYPO may have been confounded by nocebo effects (64, 65). Although participants were not aware of the study hypotheses, they were aware of the aims of the study, one of which was to investigate the effects of hypohydration on pain sensitivity. Given the negative connotations of hypohydration or dehydration, it is conceivable that participants would expect hypohydration to increase pain sensitivity, which may have subsequently influenced participants actual responses to the ischemic pain test. Fourth, the body mass change values in HYPO may not accurately reflect the fluid losses induced by the 24 h of fluid restriction. Due to the scheduling constraints that included two experimental visits within 3 days per menstrual phase, we were unable to obtain a baseline body mass at the start of the hydration intervention; thus, body mass change in HYPO was calculated using EUH body mass. As the EUH and HYPO trials within each menstrual phase were separated by at least 48 h, it is likely that the values were confounded by factors other than the change in body water content (e.g., urine and fecal losses, food and fluid consumption). Acknowledging this limitation, we obtained other measures of hydration status (i.e., Sosm, USG, copeptin, and thirst ratings) in addition to body mass change for a more accurate assessment of hydrations status. Finally, our sample size may have limited our ability to detect statistically significant menstrual phase effects on pain. As such, the effects of menstrual phase on pain require further investigation. Our study could provide a reference for future studies with a similar design to base their sample size calculations on. Nevertheless, large effect sizes (?2p\\n = 0.370.55) were obtained for the main effect of hypohydration on pain, with an observed power of 0.70.9, which suggests a low probability of false negatives.\\n\\nPerspectives and Significance\\nOur data indicate that hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women and this effect may not be reversed immediately by water ingestion. Whereas, menstrual phase (EF vs. ML) does not appear to affect pain sensitivity. These findings suggest that insufficient water intake throughout the day may exacerbate pain perception in healthy women. Given the high prevalence of hypohydration among the general population (25), future studies should investigate whether hypohydration may worsen chronic pain conditions, and the potential efficacy of maintaining adequate hydration in alleviating pain symptoms. This may be especially important for older adults, who are more likely to be hypohydrated and experience chronic pain (25, 66). For human pain researchers, controlling or measuring hydration status of participants may be important to minimize confound, as clinically and physiologically relevant tests such as the cold pressor are affected (67). Although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases after controlling for hydration status, more high-quality research is required to accurately determine whether menstrual phase does or does not affect pain sensitivity. Therefore, until a consensus on the topic has been reached, our data do not discount the need for future pain researchers to verify menstrual phase.\\n\\n  "

This was shown in a study where healthy young men and women performed 8 weeks of supervised resistance training with concomitant high- or low-dose NSAID treatment. The study found that maximal doses of ibuprofen compromised resistance exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy independent of training mode, and increases in muscle strength were attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. This study highlights the importance of drug dosage when taking NSAIDs and their effect on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise.   \n",
       "response_03    High doses of anti-inflammatory drugs, specifically ibuprofen, compromise muscle strength and hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young adults, according to a recent study. The study found that maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen compromised resistance exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy independent of training mode, and increases in muscle strength were attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The study provides strong proof-of-principle evidence that the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake, and has important implications for individuals who consume NSAIDs on a regular basis while trying to obtain the best possible benefits of resistance training.   \n",

A study showed that the maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen compromised muscle hypertrophy independent of training mode, and increased muscle strength was attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The study found that the negative effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake, and there may be distinct differences in the response to resistance training and NSAID consumption in the young vs. the elderly. This study provides strong proof-of-principle evidence that the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake.  \n",
       "response_02    Hey, did you know that high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen can compromise muscle strength and hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young adults? In a recent study, healthy young men and women performed 8 weeks of supervised resistance training with concomitant high- or low-dose NSAID treatment. The major findings were that maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen compromised resistance exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy independent of training mode and increases in muscle strength were attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The increase in muscle volume in the ASA group was of a similar magnitude to that previously reported by other studies, while the reduction in muscle hypertrophy in response to the ibuprofen treatment was quite remarkable. The study shows that daily consumption of high doses of NSAIDs attenuates strength and muscle hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young healthy individuals, and the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake.  \n",

Did you know that a new study found that high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen, can compromise muscle strength and hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young adults? The study showed that daily consumption of maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen can actually reduce muscle hypertrophy and strength gains during resistance training. Interestingly, the study also found that muscle size and strength gains were attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The only marked difference across medical treatment was a significant ibuprofen-induced reduction in IL-6 gene expression, which in our mind reflected a changed inflammatory environment that, speculatively, contributed to the attenuated hypertrophic development in the ibuprofen group. These findings have important implications for the millions of individuals worldwide who consume NSAIDs on a regular basis while trying to obtain the best possible benefits of resistance training.  \n",

The study showed that maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen can reduce muscle hypertrophy by 7.5% and attenuate increases in muscle strength, especially when training is performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The study also found that the negative effect of ibuprofen on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake, and that the drug can interfere with the normal hypertrophic development of 0.10.2% per day seen in other studies employing conventional resistance-training programmes for the knee extensors. The study provides strong proof-of-principle evidence that the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake, and the mechanistic findings should contribute to a better understanding of regulation of muscle growth in general.

       "      <td>Hey, did you know that high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen can compromise muscle strength and hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young adults? A study showed that the maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen compromised muscle hypertrophy independent of training mode, and increased muscle strength was attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The study found that the negative effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake, and there may be distinct differences in the response to resistance training and NSAID consumption in the young vs. the elderly. This study provides strong proof-of-principle evidence that the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hey, did you know that high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen can compromise muscle strength and hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young adults? In a recent study, healthy young men and women performed 8 weeks of supervised resistance training with concomitant high- or low-dose NSAID treatment. The major findings were that maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen compromised resistance exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy independent of training mode and increases in muscle strength were attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The increase in muscle volume in the ASA group was of a similar magnitude to that previously reported by other studies, while the reduction in muscle hypertrophy in response to the ibuprofen treatment was quite remarkable. The study shows that daily consumption of high doses of NSAIDs attenuates strength and muscle hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young healthy individuals, and the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hey! Did you know that a new study found that high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen, can compromise muscle strength and hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young adults? The study showed that daily consumption of maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen can actually reduce muscle hypertrophy and strength gains during resistance training. Interestingly, the study also found that muscle size and strength gains were attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The only marked difference across medical treatment was a significant ibuprofen-induced reduction in IL-6 gene expression, which in our mind reflected a changed inflammatory environment that, speculatively, contributed to the attenuated hypertrophic development in the ibuprofen group. These findings have important implications for the millions of individuals worldwide who consume NSAIDs on a regular basis while trying to obtain the best possible benefits of resistance training.</td>\n",

The study showed that maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen can reduce muscle hypertrophy by 7.5% and attenuate increases in muscle strength, especially when training is performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The study also found that the negative effect of ibuprofen on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake, and that the drug can interfere with the normal hypertrophic development of 0.10.2% per day seen in other studies employing conventional resistance-training programmes for the knee extensors. The study provides strong proof-of-principle evidence that the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake, and the mechanistic findings should contribute to a better understanding of regulation of muscle growth in general.</td>\n",

A study showed that the maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen compromised muscle hypertrophy independent of training mode, and increased muscle strength was attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The study found that the negative effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake, and there may be distinct differences in the response to resistance training and NSAID consumption in the young vs. the elderly. This study provides strong proof-of-principle evidence that the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake.  \n",
       "response_02    Hey, did you know that high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen can compromise muscle strength and hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young adults? In a recent study, healthy young men and women performed 8 weeks of supervised resistance training with concomitant high- or low-dose NSAID treatment. The major findings were that maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen compromised resistance exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy independent of training mode and increases in muscle strength were attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The increase in muscle volume in the ASA group was of a similar magnitude to that previously reported by other studies, while the reduction in muscle hypertrophy in response to the ibuprofen treatment was quite remarkable. The study shows that daily consumption of high doses of NSAIDs attenuates strength and muscle hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young healthy individuals, and the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake.  \n",

Did you know that a new study found that high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen, can compromise muscle strength and hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young adults? The study showed that daily consumption of maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen can actually reduce muscle hypertrophy and strength gains during resistance training. Interestingly, the study also found that muscle size and strength gains were attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The only marked difference across medical treatment was a significant ibuprofen-induced reduction in IL-6 gene expression, which in our mind reflected a changed inflammatory environment that, speculatively, contributed to the attenuated hypertrophic development in the ibuprofen group. These findings have important implications for the millions of individuals worldwide who consume NSAIDs on a regular basis while trying to obtain the best possible benefits of resistance training.  \n",

The study showed that maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen can reduce muscle hypertrophy by 7.5% and attenuate increases in muscle strength, especially when training is performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The study also found that the negative effect of ibuprofen on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake, and that the drug can interfere with the normal hypertrophic development of 0.10.2% per day seen in other studies employing conventional resistance-training programmes for the knee extensors. The study provides strong proof-of-principle evidence that the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake, and the mechanistic findings should contribute to a better understanding of regulation of muscle growth in general.
