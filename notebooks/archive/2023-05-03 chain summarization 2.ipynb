The review found that sleeping longer didn't hurt performance and that doing aerobic exercise was more affected by sleep than anaerobic exercise. Athletes who slept more also did better on tests of their skills, like serving in tennis or shooting in basketball. Not getting enough sleep can hurt performance in the short term, but sleeping more can help in the long term. Athletes should try to get good sleep not just the night before a big event, but also in the weeks leading up to it.\" #sleep #athleticperformance #sports #sciencecommunication   \n",

None of the studies found that sleeping more had a negative effect on performance. However, the amount of improvement varied depending on how much sleep people got and what they were trying to do. Activities that require a lot of movement and breathing, like running, are more affected by sleep than activities that don't, like weightlifting. Studies also found that sleep helps people do better when they need to use their brains to make decisions or use special skills. It's better to get more sleep over a long period of time than to try to catch up on sleep right before a big game. If you want to do your best in sports, it's important to get enough sleep not just the night before, but also in the weeks leading up to the event.\" #sportsperformance #sleepduration   \n",

This suggests that feeling judged because of your weight could make it harder to be healthy, and that approaches to promoting health that don't focus on weight might be more helpful.

The studies found that longer sleep duration has a positive impact on performance outcomes, especially for activities that require tactical and technical skills. Aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity. While longer-term sleep extension interventions showed positive results, acute sleep interventions yielded inconsistent results. It is important to note that sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension on a short timescale, but more research is required regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance.  \n",

This is important for seniors who may still be active in sports or exercise. The studies reviewed found no negative association between sleep duration and performance, and aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration than anaerobic activity. Long-term sleep extension interventions can improve outcomes requiring tactical and technical skills, and chronic sleep extension studies have shown significant benefits to athletes. To improve performance, it is recommended to focus on improving sleep not only the night before but also in the weeks leading up to an important sports event. #sportsscience #sleepresearch #athleticperformance  \n",

This information is relevant for seniors who are interested in maintaining their physical health and performance. The review found that there is no negative association between sleep duration and performance outcomes, and that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity. Long-term sleep extension interventions show benefits for technical skills-based outcomes such as tennis serving accuracy and basketball shooting. On a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. Strategies to improve sleep not only the night before but also in the weeks leading up to important sports events are likely to be fruitful in improving performance.  \n",
       "4   Sleep duration positively affects athletic performance, according to a review of published studies. None of the studies found a negative association between sleep duration and performance outcome. However, the effect size varied due to differences in sleep deprivation/extension and outcome measures. Aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity. Studies measuring outcomes requiring tactical and/or technical skills find benefits of sleep on performance. Short-term sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, but in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. Strategies to improve sleep not only the night before an important sports event but also in the weeks leading up to this event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance.

       "      <td>Lack of sleep can make it harder to maintain a healthy weight, especially for people who are already very overweight. When we don't get enough good quality sleep, it can mess with our appetite and make us less likely to want to exercise. Some studies have found that people who don't sleep well tend to have a higher body mass index (BMI), but this isn't always true for older people. For women, having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep can lead to weight gain over time. And a really long study found that people who have a hard time sleeping consistently are much more likely to become obese. So it's important to make sure we're getting enough good quality sleep if we want to stay healthy and keep our weight under control.</td>\n",

Additionally, increasing protein intake does not have any negative effects on blood lipids or markers of health in people who do resistance training. This information is important for people who want to maintain a healthy lifestyle while exercising. #protein #health #exercise   \n",

For women, having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep can lead to weight gain over time.

Poor sleep quality can lead to obesity, even in individuals without obstructive sleep apnea. Studies show that severe obesity is associated with marked sleep disturbances, which may contribute to weight gain and limit physical activity. Worse sleep quality is linked to higher BMI, and inconsistent sleep continuity and impaired sleep continuity increase the risk of transitioning to and staying obese. Sleep quality and duration affect waist circumference, with young women showing a stronger relationship. Growth hormone deficiency, which can be caused by reduced SWS, is linked to visceral obesity.

       "73                                        Lack of sleep can contribute to obesity, especially in severely obese individuals. This is relevant for sports enthusiasts because poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness can lead to dysregulation of appetite and limit the drive for physical activity, thereby compromising weight maintenance. While worse sleep quality is associated with higher BMI, the relationship between sleep quality and obesity is less robust in older age groups. In women, sleep problems like difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep have been found to predict weight gain after 5-7 years. Consistent sleep discontinuity is associated with a 70% risk of conversion to obesity over a 30-year period. Prioritizing good sleep hygiene is important for overall health and weight management, which can ultimately improve athletic performance.   \n",

       "70  💤 Poor sleep quality can lead to obesity, even in individuals without obstructive sleep apnea. Studies show that severe obesity is associated with marked sleep disturbances, which may contribute to weight gain and limit physical activity. Cross-sectional studies report that worse sleep quality is linked to higher BMI, while longitudinal studies have been inconsistent. Sleep quality and duration affect waist circumference, with young women showing a stronger relationship. Growth hormone deficiency, which can be caused by reduced SWS, is linked to visceral obesity. Inconsistent sleep continuity and impaired sleep continuity increase the risk of transitioning to and staying obese.
