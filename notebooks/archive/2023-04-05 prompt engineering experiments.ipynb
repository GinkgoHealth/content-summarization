       "'Juveniles (1 to 20 y):\\nTotal and basal expenditure, along with fat free mass, continued to increase with age \\nthroughout childhood and adolescence (Figure 1), but body size-adjusted expenditures \\nsteadily declined. Adjusted total expenditure declined at a rate of −2.8 ± 0.1% per year \\nfrom 147.8 ± 22.6% for subjects 1 – 2 y (n = 102) to 102.7 ± 18.1% for subjects 20 – \\n25 y (n = 314; Tables S2, S4). Segmented regression analysis identified a breakpoint in \\nadjusted total expenditure at 20.5 y (95% CI: 19.8, 21.2), after which it plateaued at adult \\nlevels (Figure 2). A similar decline (−3.8 ± 0.2% per year) and break point (18.0 y, 95% \\nCI: 16.8, 19.2) were evident in adjusted basal expenditure (Figure 2, Text S1, Table S4). No \\npubertal increases in adjusted total or basal expenditure were evident among subjects 10 – \\n15 y. In multivariate regression for subjects 1 to 20 y, males had a higher total expenditure \\nand adjusted total expenditure (Tables S2, S3), but sex had no detectable effect on the rate of \\ndecline in adjusted total expenditure with age (sex:age interaction p=0.30).\\nAdults (20 to 60 y):\\nTotal and basal expenditure and fat free mass were all stable from age 20 to 60 (Figure 1, \\n2; Tables S1, S2; Text S1). Sex had no effect on total expenditure in multivariate models \\nwith fat free mass and fat mass, nor in analyses of adjusted total expenditure (Tables S2, \\nS4). Adjusted total and basal expenditures were stable even during pregnancy, the elevation \\nin unadjusted expenditures matching those expected from the gain in mothers’ fat free \\nmass and fat mass (Figure 2C). Segmented regression analysis identified a break point at \\n63.0 y (95% CI: 60.1, 65.9), after which adjusted TEE begins to decline. This break point \\nwas somewhat earlier for adjusted basal expenditure (46.5, 95% CI: 40.6, 52.4), but the \\nrelatively small number of basal measures for 45 – 65 y (Figure 2D) reduces our precision in \\ndetermining this break point.\\nOlder adults (>60 y):\\nAt ~60 y, total and basal expenditure begin to decline, along with fat free mass and fat mass \\n(Figures 1, S3, Table S1). Declines in expenditure are not only a function of reduced fat free \\nmass and fat mass, however. Adjusted total expenditure declined by −0.7 ± 0.1% per year, \\nand adjusted basal expendiure fell at a similar rates (Figure 2, Figure S3, Text S1, Table S4). \\nFor subjects in their nineties, adjusted TEE was ~26% below that of middle-aged adults.\\nIn addition to providing empirical measures and predictive equations for total expenditure \\nfrom infancy to old age (Tables S1, S2), our analyses bring to light major changes in \\nmetabolic rate across the life course. To begin, we can infer fetal metabolic rates from \\nmaternal measures during pregnancy: if body size-adjusted expenditures were elevated in the \\nfetus, then adjusted expenditures for pregnant mothers, particularly late in pregnancy when \\nthe fetus accounts for a substantial portion of a mother’s weight, would be likewise elevated. \\nInstead, the stability of adjusted total and basal expenditures at ~100% during pregnancy \\n(Figure 2B) indicates that the growing fetus maintains a fat free mass- and fat mass-adjusted \\nmetabolic rate similar to adults, which is consistent with adjusted expenditures of neonates \\n(both ~100%; Figure 2) in the first weeks after birth.

       "  'text': 'Expenditure varies as we age, with four distinct metabolic life stages reflecting changes in behavior, anatomy, and tissue metabolism. All of life’s essential tasks, from development and reproduction to maintenance and movement, require energy. Total expenditure is thus fundamental to understanding both daily nutritional requirements and the body’s investment among activities. Yet we know surprisingly little about the determinants of total expenditure in humans or how it changes over the lifespan. Most large (n>1,000) analyses of human energy expenditure have been limited to basal expenditure, the metabolic rate at rest ( ), which accounts for only a portion (usually ~50-70%) of total expenditure, or have estimated total expenditure from basal expenditure and daily physical activity ( ). Measurements of total expenditure in humans during daily life, outside of the laboratory, became possible in the 1980’s with the advancement of the doubly labeled water method , but doubly labeled water studies to date have been limited in sample size (n < 600), geographic and socioeconomic representation, and/or age ( ). Body composition, size, and physical activity change over the life course, often in concert, making it difficult to parse the determinants of energy expenditure. Total expenditure increases with age as children grow ( 10 ), but the relative effects of increasing physical',\n",

Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr).

We converted these residuals to “adjusted” expenditures for clarity in discussing age-related changes: 100% indicates an expenditure that matches the expected value given the subject’s fat free mass and fat mass, 120% indicates an expenditure 20% above expected, etc. (Methods). Using this approach, we also calculated the portion of adjusted total expenditure attributed to basal expenditure (Figure 2D; Methods).

The decline in total expenditure beginning in the sixth decade of life corresponds with a decline in fat free mass ( ) and “physical activity level”, PAL (the ratio of total/basal expenditure), but may also reflect age-related reductions in organ metabolism. We investigated the effects of age, body composition, and sex on total expenditure and its components, using a large (n = 6,421; 64% female), geographically and economical diverse (n = 29 countries) database of doubly labeled water measurements for subjects aged eight days to 95 years ( 16 ), calculating total expenditure from isotopic measurements using a single, validated equation for all subjects ( 17 ). Basal expenditure, measured via indirect calorimetry, was available for a n = 2,008 subjects, and we augmented the dataset with additional published meaures of basal expenditure in neonates and doubly labeled water-mesaured total expenditure in pregnant and post-partum women (Methods; Table S1). We found that both total and basal expenditure increased with fat free mass in a power-law manner (TEE= 0.677FFM',\n",

Thus, body size, particularly fat free mass, accounted for most (83%) of the variation in daily expenditure, requiring us to adjust for body size in subsequent analyses of expenditure across subjects and cohorts to isolate potential effects of age, sex, and other factors. Notably, analyses indicated an exponent <1, meaning that the ratio of energy expenditure/mass does not adequately control for body size because the ratio inherently trends lower for larger individuals (Figure S1 ( 18 )). Instead, we used regression analysis to control for body size 18 ). A general linear model with ln-transformed values of energy expenditure (total or basal), fat free mass, and fat mass in adults 20 – 60 y (Table S2) was used to calculate residual energy expenditures for each subject. We converted these residuals to “adjusted” expenditures for clarity in discussing age-related changes: 100% indicates an expenditure that matches the expected value given the subject’s fat free mass and fat mass, 120% indicates an expenditure 20% above expected, etc. (Methods).

A similar decline (−3.8 ± 0.2% per year) and break point (18.0 y, 95% CI: 16.8, 19.2) were evident in adjusted basal expenditure (Figure 2, Text S1, Table S4). No pubertal increases in adjusted total or basal expenditure were evident among subjects 10 – 15 y. In multivariate regression for subjects 1 to 20 y, males had a higher total expenditure and adjusted total expenditure (Tables S2, S3), but sex had no detectable effect on the rate of decline in adjusted total expenditure with age (sex:age interaction p=0.30).',\n",

Organs with a high tissue-specific metabolic rate, particularly the brain and liver, account for a greater proportion of fat free mass in young individuals, and thus organ-based basal expenditure, estimated from organ size and tissue-specific metabolic rate, follows a power-law relationship with fat free mass, roughly consistent with observed basal expenditures (Methods, Figure S6). Still, observed basal expenditure exceeded organ-based estimates by ~30% in early life (1 – 20 y) and was ~20% lower than organ-based estimates in subjects over 60 y (Figure S6), consistent with previous work indicating that tissue-specific metabolic rates are elevated in children and adolescents 22 24 ) and reduced in older adults ( 21 23 25 ).

       "      <td>Total daily energy expenditure (“total expenditure”, MJ/d) reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, yet it is unclear how daily expenditure changes over the life course. Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.</td>\n",

All of life’s essential tasks, from development and reproduction to maintenance and movement, require energy. Total expenditure is thus fundamental to understanding both daily nutritional requirements and the body’s investment among activities. Yet we know surprisingly little about the determinants of total expenditure in humans or how it changes over the lifespan. Most large (n&gt;1,000) analyses of human energy expenditure have been limited to basal expenditure, the metabolic rate at rest ( ), which accounts for only a portion (usually ~50-70%) of total expenditure, or have estimated total expenditure from basal expenditure and daily physical activity ( ). Measurements of total expenditure in humans during daily life, outside of the laboratory, became possible in the 1980’s with the advancement of the doubly labeled water method , but doubly labeled water studies to date have been limited in sample size (n &lt; 600), geographic and socioeconomic representation, and/or age ( ). Body composition, size, and physical activity change over the life course, often in concert, making it difficult to parse the determinants of energy expenditure.

Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.   \n",

All of life’s essential tasks, from development and reproduction to maintenance and movement, require energy. Total expenditure is thus fundamental to understanding both daily nutritional requirements and the body’s investment among activities. Yet we know surprisingly little about the determinants of total expenditure in humans or how it changes over the lifespan. Most large (n>1,000) analyses of human energy expenditure have been limited to basal expenditure, the metabolic rate at rest ( ), which accounts for only a portion (usually ~50-70%) of total expenditure, or have estimated total expenditure from basal expenditure and daily physical activity ( ). Measurements of total expenditure in humans during daily life, outside of the laboratory, became possible in the 1980’s with the advancement of the doubly labeled water method , but doubly labeled water studies to date have been limited in sample size (n < 600), geographic and socioeconomic representation, and/or age ( ). Body composition, size, and physical activity change over the life course, often in concert, making it difficult to parse the determinants of energy expenditure. Total expenditure increases with age as children grow ( 10 ), but the relative effects of increasing physical   \n",

Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.</td>\n",

All of life’s essential tasks, from development and reproduction to maintenance and movement, require energy. Total expenditure is thus fundamental to understanding both daily nutritional requirements and the body’s investment among activities. Yet we know surprisingly little about the determinants of total expenditure in humans or how it changes over the lifespan. Most large (n&gt;1,000) analyses of human energy expenditure have been limited to basal expenditure, the metabolic rate at rest ( ), which accounts for only a portion (usually ~50-70%) of total expenditure, or have estimated total expenditure from basal expenditure and daily physical activity ( ). Measurements of total expenditure in humans during daily life, outside of the laboratory, became possible in the 1980’s with the advancement of the doubly labeled water method , but doubly labeled water studies to date have been limited in sample size (n &lt; 600), geographic and socioeconomic representation, and/or age ( ). Body composition, size, and physical activity change over the life course, often in concert, making it difficult to parse the determinants of energy expenditure.

The decline in total expenditure beginning in the sixth decade of life corresponds with a decline in fat free mass ( ) and “physical activity level”, PAL (the ratio of total/basal expenditure), but may also reflect age-related reductions in organ metabolism. We investigated the effects of age, body composition, and sex on total expenditure and its components, using a large (n = 6,421; 64% female), geographically and economical diverse (n = 29 countries) database of doubly labeled water measurements for subjects aged eight days to 95 years ( 16 ), calculating total expenditure from isotopic measurements using a single, validated equation for all subjects ( 17 ).

Thus, body size, particularly fat free mass, accounted for most (83%) of the variation in daily expenditure, requiring us to adjust for body size in subsequent analyses of expenditure across subjects and cohorts to isolate potential effects of age, sex, and other factors. Notably, analyses indicated an exponent &lt;1, meaning that the ratio of energy expenditure/mass does not adequately control for body size because the ratio inherently trends lower for larger individuals (Figure S1 ( 18 )). Instead, we used regression analysis to control for body size 18 ). A general linear model with ln-transformed values of energy expenditure (total or basal), fat free mass, and fat mass in adults 20 – 60 y (Table S2) was used to calculate residual energy expenditures for each subject. We converted these residuals to “adjusted” expenditures for clarity in discussing age-related changes: 100% indicates an expenditure that matches the expected value given the subject’s fat free mass and fat mass, 120% indicates an expenditure 20% above expected, etc. (Methods). Using this approach, we also calculated the portion of adjusted total expenditure attributed to basal expenditure (Figure 2D; Methods). Segmented regression analysis of (Methods) revealed four distinct phases of adjusted (or residual) total and basal expenditure over the lifespan.</td>\n",

After rapid acceleration in total and basal expenditure during the first year, adjusted expenditures progressively decline thereafter, reaching adult levels at ~20 yr. Elevated adjusted expenditures in this life stage may reflect the metabolic demands of growth and development. Adult expenditures, adjusted for body size and composition, are remarkably stable, even during pregnancy and post-partum. Declining metabolic rates in older adults could increase the risk of weight gain. However, neither fat mass nor percentage increased in this period (Figure S3), consistent with the hypothesis that energy intake is coupled to expenditure ( 20 ). Following previous studies ( 21 25 ), we calculated the effect of organ size on basal expenditure over the lifespan (Methods). At rest, the tissue-specific metabolic rates (Watts/ gram) of the heart, liver, brain, and kidneys are much greater than those of the muscles and other lean tissue or fat ( 21 25 ). Organs with a high tissue-specific metabolic rate, particularly the brain and liver, account for a greater proportion of fat free mass in young individuals, and thus organ-based basal expenditure, estimated from organ size and tissue-specific metabolic rate, follows a power-law relationship with fat free mass, roughly consistent with observed basal expenditures (Methods, Figure S6). Still, observed basal expenditure exceeded organ-based estimates by ~30% in early life (1 – 20 y) and was ~20% lower than organ-based estimates in subjects over 60 y (Figure S6), consistent with previous work indicating that tissue-specific metabolic rates are elevated in children and adolescents 22 24 ) and reduced in older adults ( 21 23 25 ). We investigated the contributions of daily physical activity and changes in tissue-specific metabolic rate to total and basal expenditure using a simple model with two components: activity and basal expenditure (Figure 3; Methods). Activity expenditure was modeled as</td>\n",

       "      <td>Metabolic models of life history commonly assume continuity in tissue-specific metabolism over the life course, with cellular metabolic rates increasing in a power-law manner (Energy = aMass ) and the energy available for growth during the juvenile period made available for reproduction in adults ( 29 30 ). Measures of humans here challenge this view, with size adjusted metabolism elevated ~50% in childhood compared to adults (including pregnant females), and ~25% lower in the oldest subjects. It remains to be determined whether these fluctuations occur in other species. In addition to affecting energy balance, nutritional needs, and body weight, these metabolic changes present a potential target for clinical investigation into the kinetics of disease, pharmaceutical activity, and healing, processes intimately related to metabolic rate. Further, there is considerable metabolic variation among individuals, with TEE and its components varying more than ± 20% even when controlling for fat free mass, fat mass, sex, and age (Figure 1, 2, Table S2). Elucidating the processes underlying metabolic changes across the life course and variation among individuals may help reveal the roles of metabolic variation in health and disease.</td>\n",

Here, we analyze a large, globally diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 yr. We show that total expenditure is strongly related to fat free mass in a power-law manner and identify four distinct metabolic life stages. Fat free mass-adjusted daily expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates (0-1yr) to ~46% above adult values at ~1 yr, declines slowly throughout childhood and adolescence (1-20 yr) to adult levels at ~20 yr, remains stable in adulthood (20-60 yr) even during pregnancy, and declines in older adults (60+ yr). These changes in total expenditure shed new light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the lifespan.   \n",

All of life’s essential tasks, from development and reproduction to maintenance and movement, require energy. Total expenditure is thus fundamental to understanding both daily nutritional requirements and the body’s investment among activities. Yet we know surprisingly little about the determinants of total expenditure in humans or how it changes over the lifespan. Most large (n>1,000) analyses of human energy expenditure have been limited to basal expenditure, the metabolic rate at rest ( ), which accounts for only a portion (usually ~50-70%) of total expenditure, or have estimated total expenditure from basal expenditure and daily physical activity ( ). Measurements of total expenditure in humans during daily life, outside of the laboratory, became possible in the 1980’s with the advancement of the doubly labeled water method , but doubly labeled water studies to date have been limited in sample size (n < 600), geographic and socioeconomic representation, and/or age ( ). Body composition, size, and physical activity change over the life course, often in concert, making it difficult to parse the determinants of energy expenditure.

The decline in total expenditure beginning in the sixth decade of life corresponds with a decline in fat free mass ( ) and “physical activity level”, PAL (the ratio of total/basal expenditure), but may also reflect age-related reductions in organ metabolism. We investigated the effects of age, body composition, and sex on total expenditure and its components, using a large (n = 6,421; 64% female), geographically and economical diverse (n = 29 countries) database of doubly labeled water measurements for subjects aged eight days to 95 years ( 16 ), calculating total expenditure from isotopic measurements using a single, validated equation for all subjects ( 17 ). Basal expenditure, measured via indirect calorimetry, was available for a n = 2,008 subjects, and we augmented the dataset with additional published meaures of basal expenditure in neonates and doubly labeled water-mesaured total expenditure in pregnant and post-partum women (Methods; Table S1). We found that both total and basal expenditure increased with fat free mass in a power-law manner (TEE= 0.677FFM   \n",

Thus, body size, particularly fat free mass, accounted for most (83%) of the variation in daily expenditure, requiring us to adjust for body size in subsequent analyses of expenditure across subjects and cohorts to isolate potential effects of age, sex, and other factors. Notably, analyses indicated an exponent <1, meaning that the ratio of energy expenditure/mass does not adequately control for body size because the ratio inherently trends lower for larger individuals (Figure S1 ( 18 )). Instead, we used regression analysis to control for body size 18 ). A general linear model with ln-transformed values of energy expenditure (total or basal), fat free mass, and fat mass in adults 20 – 60 y (Table S2) was used to calculate residual energy expenditures for each subject. We converted these residuals to “adjusted” expenditures for clarity in discussing age-related changes: 100% indicates an expenditure that matches the expected value given the subject’s fat free mass and fat mass, 120% indicates an expenditure 20% above expected, etc. (Methods). Using this approach, we also calculated the portion of adjusted total expenditure attributed to basal expenditure (Figure 2D; Methods). Segmented regression analysis of (Methods) revealed four distinct phases of adjusted (or residual) total and basal expenditure over the lifespan.   \n",

Adjusted total expenditure declined at a rate of −2.8 ± 0.1% per year from 147.8 ± 22.6% for subjects 1 – 2 y (n = 102) to 102.7 ± 18.1% for subjects 20 – 25 y (n = 314; Tables S2, S4). Segmented regression analysis identified a breakpoint in adjusted total expenditure at 20.5 y (95% CI: 19.8, 21.2), after which it plateaued at adult levels (Figure 2). A similar decline (−3.8 ± 0.2% per year) and break point (18.0 y, 95% CI: 16.8, 19.2) were evident in adjusted basal expenditure (Figure 2, Text S1, Table S4). No pubertal increases in adjusted total or basal expenditure were evident among subjects 10 – 15 y. In multivariate regression for subjects 1 to 20 y, males had a higher total expenditure and adjusted total expenditure (Tables S2, S3), but sex had no detectable effect on the rate of decline in adjusted total expenditure with age (sex:age interaction p=0.30).   \n",

Sex had no effect on total expenditure in multivariate models with fat free mass and fat mass, nor in analyses of adjusted total expenditure (Tables S2, S4). Adjusted total and basal expenditures were stable even during pregnancy, the elevation in unadjusted expenditures matching those expected from the gain in mothers’ fat free mass and fat mass (Figure 2C). Segmented regression analysis identified a break point at 63.0 y (95% CI: 60.1, 65.9), after which adjusted TEE begins to decline. This break point was somewhat earlier for adjusted basal expenditure (46.5, 95% CI: 40.6, 52.4), but the relatively small number of basal measures for 45 – 65 y (Figure 2D) reduces our precision in determining this break point.   \n",
       "113                                           ). Increasing energy demands could be a contributing factor. After rapid acceleration in total and basal expenditure during the first year, adjusted expenditures progressively decline thereafter, reaching adult levels at ~20 yr. Elevated adjusted expenditures in this life stage may reflect the metabolic demands of growth and development. Adult expenditures, adjusted for body size and composition, are remarkably stable, even during pregnancy and post-partum. Declining metabolic rates in older adults could increase the risk of weight gain. However, neither fat mass nor percentage increased in this period (Figure S3), consistent with the hypothesis that energy intake is coupled to expenditure ( 20 ). Following previous studies ( 21 25 ), we calculated the effect of organ size on basal expenditure over the lifespan (Methods). At rest, the tissue-specific metabolic rates (Watts/ gram) of the heart, liver, brain, and kidneys are much greater than those of the muscles and other lean tissue or fat ( 21 25 ). Organs with a high tissue-specific metabolic rate, particularly the brain and liver, account for a greater proportion of fat free mass in young individuals, and thus organ-based basal expenditure, estimated from organ size and tissue-specific metabolic rate, follows a power-law relationship with fat free mass, roughly consistent with observed basal expenditures (Methods, Figure S6). Still, observed basal expenditure exceeded organ-based estimates by ~30% in early life (1 – 20 y) and was ~20% lower than organ-based estimates in subjects over 60 y (Figure S6), consistent with previous work indicating that tissue-specific metabolic rates are elevated in children and adolescents 22 24 ) and reduced in older adults ( 21 23 25 ). We investigated the contributions of daily physical activity and changes in tissue-specific metabolic rate to total and basal expenditure using a simple model with two components: activity and basal expenditure (Figure 3; Methods).

Measures of humans here challenge this view, with size adjusted metabolism elevated ~50% in childhood compared to adults (including pregnant females), and ~25% lower in the oldest subjects. It remains to be determined whether these fluctuations occur in other species. In addition to affecting energy balance, nutritional needs, and body weight, these metabolic changes present a potential target for clinical investigation into the kinetics of disease, pharmaceutical activity, and healing, processes intimately related to metabolic rate. Further, there is considerable metabolic variation among individuals, with TEE and its components varying more than ± 20% even when controlling for fat free mass, fat mass, sex, and age (Figure 1, 2, Table S2).

Individual subjects and age-sex cohort mean ± SD are shown. For both total (Adj. TEE) ( ) and basal (Adj. BEE) expenditure ( ), adjusted expenditures begin near adult levels (~100%) but quickly climb to ~150% in the first year. Adjusted expenditures decline to adult levels ~20y, then decline again in older adults. Basal expenditures for infants and children not in the doubly labeled water database are shown in gray. C. Pregnant mothers exhibit adjusted total and basal expenditures similar to non-reproducing adults (Pre: prior to pregnancy; Post: 27 weeks post-partum). .

In this secondary analysis of a repeated measures, nutritional intervention study, we tested whether an individual s sleep quality, duration and timing impact glycaemic response to a breakfast meal the following morning. Methods Healthy adults data ( = 953 [41% twins]) were analysed from the PREDICT dietary intervention trial. Participants consumed isoenergetic standardised meals over 2 weeks in the clinic and at home. Actigraphy was used to assess sleep variables (duration, efficiency, timing) and continuous glucose monitors were used to measure glycaemic variation (&gt;8000 meals). Results Sleep variables were significantly associated with postprandial glycaemic control (2 h incremental AUC), at both between- and within-person levels. Sleep period time interacted with meal type, with a smaller effect of poor sleep on postpran- dial blood glucose levels when high-carbohydrate (low fat/protein) ( pinteraction =0 . 0 2 ) a n d h i g h - f a t ( pinteraction = 0.03) breakfasts were consumed compared with a reference 75 g OGTT. Within-person sleep period time had a similar interaction (high carbohydrate: pinteraction =0 . 0 0 1 , h i g h f a t : pinteraction = 0.02). Within- and between-person sleep efficiency were significantly associated with lower postprandial blood glucose levels irrespective of meal type (both &lt; 0.03). Later sleep midpoint (time deviation from midnight) was found to be significantly associated with higher postprandial glucose, in both between-person and</td>\n",

Conclusions/interpretation Poor sleep efficiency and later bedtime routines are associated with more pronounced postprandial glycaemic responses to breakfast the following morning. A person s deviation from their usual sleep pattern was also associated with poorer postprandial glycaemic control. These findings underscore sleep as a modifiable, non-pharmacological therapeutic target for the optimal regulation of human metabolic health. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03479866.

Sleep disor- ders often coalesce with other health ailments, and in this way provide a barometer of general health [ 1]. Sleep has direct causal effects on many life-threatening diseases such as CVD, obesity and type 2 diabetes [ 2 5]. Its disturbance (such as obstructive sleep apnoea) is associated with type 2 diabetes prevalence and complications [ 6] and can disrupt glucose homeostasis [ 7]. These and other data [ 8 10] point to a strong link between sleep quality/duration and glucose homeostasis. However, while there have been numerous large prospective cohort studies focused on the relationship between self- reported sleep, disease and wellbeing, objective data on sleep and postprandial glucose metabolism typically emanates from small studies conducted in tightly controlled settings and in specific population subgroups such as those suffering sleep disturbances owing to pregnancy, sleep apnoea, depression,obesity or diabetes [ 11]. Thus, the evidence base for potential recommendations concerning the effects of sleep on glucose metabolism in generally healthy people has considerable scope for expansion. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation- ship between sleep (duration, efficiency and midpoint) and postprandial glycaemic response to breakfasts of varying macronutrient composition in healthy adults from the UK and USA. Given the established role of sleep in glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes [ 12], we hypothesised that shorter sleep duration and poorer quality sleep would be associated with higher 2 h postprandial glucose incremental AUC (iAUC). We also hypothesised that there would be an</td>\n",

Metabolic responses to various foods differing in macronutrient and energy content were determined in relation to each partici- pant s meal timing and sleep, as well as a range of biological characteristics [ 13]. The study was conducted between June 2018 and May 2019 and included 1002 generally healthy participants aged 18 65 years in the UK, as well as 100 gener- ally healthy participants in the USA, with data being combined as there were no differences of effects for the two locations. Some of the UK participants were recruited from the TwinsUK research cohort, which includes both monozy- gotic twin (sharing the vast majority of their DNA sequence) and dizygotic twins (sharing roughly half of their DNA sequence) [ 14]. Healthy was defined as being free of diag- nosed diseases from the exclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria were as follows: ongoing inflammatory disease; cancer in the last 3 years (excluding skin cancer); long-term gastrointestinal disorders; taking immunosuppressants; using proton-pump inhibitors; diabetes; depression; eating disorder; and pregnan- cy. A full description of the PREDICT1 study protocol, including the rationale for the sample size, can be found else- where [ 13]. The current report describes secondary analyses of the PREDICT1 trial. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee and Integrated Research Application System (IRAS 236407) and from the Institutional Review Board (Partners Healthcare IRB 2018P002078) in the UK and USA, respectively. Written informed consent was obtain- ed from each participant immediately prior to enrolment in the trial during the baseline clinic visit. Test meal challenges Participants consumed standardised test meals of different nutritional composition (carbohydrates, fat, protein and dietary fibre). The meals were consumed either for breakfast</td>\n",

Participants were also requested to limit physical exer- cise during the 3 h period following the meal, as well as during the 8 h fasting period prior to its consumption. More detailed explanation of the test meal challenge protocol can be found elsewhere [ 13]. In this analysis, we included only the logged meals that complied with the protocol and passed logging accuracy assessment conducted by the study staff [ 13]. For example, overnight fasting was manually checked for each user, with the accuracy of meal being marked down if the time between last logged food the day before and the first on the following day was less than 8 h. Since glucose tolerance differs across the day owing to circadian effects that are independent of sleep [ 15], we excluded all meals except those consumed at breakfast from the analyses, thereby reducing non-sleep- related circadian effects on glucose regulation [ 15 17]. The OGTT was used as the reference meal type in the linear mixed-effects models, as the OGTT is the reference standard for assessing post-load glycaemic control in clinical settings. Sleep assessment Activity and sleep were monitored using a wearable device with a triaxial accelerometer (AX3, Axivity; Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK). Accelerometers were fitted by trained research staff on the non-dominant wrist and were worn by the partic- ipants for the duration of the entire study. Raw accelerometer data were analysed using GGIR, a multi-day raw accelerometer data analysis package in R [ 18, 19]. The raw accelerometer data from a wrist actigraphy units were converted into a single activity time series (BFEN) aggregated into epochs of 30 s. Sleep/wake detection was performed using the validated angle-z method implemented in GGIR [ 19]. Based on prior evidence linking sleep with metabolic system regulation [ 12], primary a priori target vari- ables were as follows: (1) sleep duration or total sleep period</td>\n",

Nights with &lt;2 h or &gt;15 h of sleep or with SE &lt;20% were excluded from the analysis, as they likely resulted from artefacts or poor-quality data (355 nights [2.5%]). Nights with more than 10% data classified as invalidwere also excluded (399 nights [2.8%]). In addition, nights with a sleep onset during 08:00 17:00 h or a sleep offset after 00:00 h were excluded (26 nights [0.2%]). Finally, data from participants with less than 7 days of data and/or a percentage of invalid nights &gt;35% ( = 89) were removed. We also removed data from participants who travelled in different time zones during the study, owing to disruption of their regular sleep patterns. Glucose assessment Postprandial blood glucose was computed using a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) wearable device (Freestyle Libre Pro; Abbott, Abbott Park, IL, USA), which measures interstitial glucose every 15 min. Monitors were fitted by trained research staff to the participant s upper non-dominant arm and were worn for the entire study duration. Owing to the CGM s cali- bration requirements, CGM data collected 12 h after fitting the device to a participant was used for analysis [ 13]. Incremental area under the blood glucose curve has been shown to accurately describe glycaemic responses to foods [ 22]. Accordingly, the primary outcome for this analysis was 2 h iAUC</td>\n",

For random effects terms, we use d participant ID (randomly generated study identification [ID] number) and family ID to allow for person-specific linear regressions, where partici- pants have their own intercepts for the association of interest. Participant ID was nested within family ID to account for the data s nested/hierarchical structure and the fact that measures coming from twins belonging to the same family might be more similar to each other owing to genetic and/or environ- mental factors. The models had random intercepts but no random slopes. Visual inspection of diagnostic plots did not reveal any strong deviations from homoscedasticity or normality, and all models were checked for multicollinearity. The main hypotheses tested were as follows: (1) whether the relationship between sleep (quality, timing or duration) and blood glucose is statistically different from the null hypothesis of no effect; and (2) whether the relationship between sleepand postprandial glycaemic response differs in magnitude conditional on the type of br eakfast consumed. ESM Methods provides R codes for each of the main hypothesis tests. Owing to the hypothesis-driven nature of the analyses reported here, we considered a nominal value threshold of 0.05 to be of statistical significance. Results Participant characteristics Data from 953 participants were used to analyse 8395 sleep and postprandial responses (Fig. 1,T a b l e 1). Consort diagrams for the PREDICT1 study can be found elsewhere [ 26].

However, we found a statistically significantinteraction between SPT and meal type, with SPT having a significantly negative association with glucose iAUC0-2h following high-carbohydrate and high-fat breakfasts ( SPT × high carb = 1.10, SPT × high carb =0 . 0 2 1 ; SPT × high fat 40g = 1.07, SPT × high fat 40g =0 . 0 3 1 ) ( F i g . 2and ESM Table 1). Within-participant effects The person-centred model revealed an effect similar to that of the between-person model, suggest- ing that an SPT that exceeded a person s average SPT is asso- ciated with lower postprandial response following a high- carbohydrate or high-fat breakfast ( SPT-person × high carb = 1.84, SPT-person × high carb = 0.001; SPT-person × high fat 40g= 1.36, SPT-person × high fat 40g = 0.019) (ESM Table 2). SE Between-participant effects A larger between-person SE was significantly associated with lower glucose iAUC0-2h ( SE= 10.48 [95% CI 19.85, 1.11], SE=0 . 0 2 8 ) ( E S M Table 3). In a model assessing the interaction of SE and meal type, higher SE was still significantly associated with lower glucose iAUC0-2h ( SE= 19.18 [95% CI 36.46, 1.91], SE = 0.030), but none of the interaction terms was statistically significant (ESM Table 3).

In the model with SE and meal type interac- tion term, higher within-person SE was still significantly asso- ciated with lower glucose iAUC0-2h ( SE= 29.75 [95% CI SE 52.29, 7.21], SE=0 . 0 1 0 ) ( E S M T a b l e 4). Sleep midpoint Between-participant and within-participant effects A later between-person sleep midpoint (expressed in hours as a devi- ation from midnight) was significantly associated with higher glucose iAUC ( midpoint =0 . 5 2 [ 9 5 % C I midpoint 0.04, 1.01], midpoint =0 . 0 3 5 ) ( T a b l e 2). This effect was largely driven by sleep onset (going to bed later) rather than sleep offset (waking up later) (ESM Tables 5 7). The effect ceased to be significant in a model incorpo rating an interaction term between sleep midpoint and meal type (Table 2). In the within-person effects model, having a later sleep midpoint than one s average had a similar coefficient ( midpoint = 0.51 [95% CI midpoint 0.00, 1.02], midpoint =0 . 0 5 1 ) . Discussion Here, we describe for the first time how sleep duration, quality and midpoint associate with postprandial glucose metabolism in healthy individuals. While sleep is generally recognised as one of the pillars of good health, the data reported here suggest that one-size-fits-all sleep recommendations are suboptimal, particularly in the context of postprandial glycaemic control, a key component of diabetes prevention. By analysing both between-person and within-person effects, this study provides unique and powerful insights into both population-level and person-level effects of sleep on metabolic health. Notably, our data suggest that sleep dura- tion, efficiency and midpoint are important determinants of postprandial glycaemic control at a population level, while</td>\n",

Several studies have investigated the relationship between sleep duration and glucose metabolism in pregnant women and reported a posi- tive association between reduced sleep duration and impaired glucose metabolism [ 4,27]. However, we are not aware of any other studies to date that investigate the relationship between objectively assessed sleep characteristics and postprandial glucose metabolism in generally healthy adults. The findings from this intervention study, with repeated test meal chal- lenges, combined with objective assessments of sleep andblood glucose from a large population, complement a relative- ly small body of knowledge around a topic that is likely to be of high relevance for diabetes prevention [ 26]. Importantly, many earlier studies were undertaken in sleep laboratories with small sample size [ 11]. While the controlled environment of such studies is necessary to understand specific aspects of sleep and metabolism, the real-world, community-dwelling setting of the current study provides novel insights into how habitual sleep affects metabolic health. The main analyses in this study focused on interactions of sleep and meal type and selected the OGTT as the breakfast against which all other breakfast meals were compared. This is primarily because the OGTT is the standard clinical test used to assess glucose tolerance. While this is not a realistic break- fast meal, there is a growing trend, particularly among youn- ger people [ 28], to consume energy drinks as a pick-me-up the morning after a poor night s sleep, with the sugar content of a 75 g OGTT equating to roughly two to three servings of stan- dard energy drinks.

As for the within-person SPT model, our findings suggest that both a longer SPT in general, as well as having a longer SPT than one is used to, are associated with improved postprandial glycaemic control the following morning. The pres- ence of a significant finding wi th the SPT × high-carbohydrate meal interaction term in the person-centred model suggests that getting more sleep than usual might be more important for post- prandial glycaemic control than the absolute amount of sleep achieved. This insight offers a potential avenue for personalised (within-person) sleep interventions. SE Better SE, between-person as well as within-person, was signif- icantly associated with lower glucose iAUC, meaning that better SE, which is a proxy of sleep quali ty, was associated with better glucose management following breakfast. However, the absence of SE × meal interactions suggests that SE may be beneficial for postprandial glucose response irrespective of meal composition. Although there is not much research on SE and glucose metab- olism in healthy adults, our findings concur with a recent meta- analysis in which poor sleep quality was associated with poor glycaemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes [ 12]. Moreover, since SE can be viewed as a proxy for sleep quality, and because we found a significant association between SE and glucose regulation, but not between SPT and glucose regulation, our findings suggest that sleep quality is more important than sleep duration with respect to glycaemic control. However, sleep apnoea is known to affect SE, and sleep apnoea was not measured in the PREDICT1 study. Sleep midpoint The presence of significant effects in both between-person and within-person sleep midpoint models adjusted for sleep dura- tion suggests a novel finding that later sleep midpoint, such as that caused by going to bed later, is associated with impaired postprandial glucose response to breakfast the following morning. This concurs with the proposition that human meta-</td>\n",

Alternatively, later sleep midpoint may reflect alteration of sleep stages caused by going to bed later. Thus, the significance of later sleep midpoint may also be indicative of the role of specific sleep stages, such as slow-wave sleep, on glucose metabolism, supporting the view that treating slow-wave sleep disorders may help improve glycaemic control [ 32]. The 2 h glucose iAUC response to an OGTT breakfast is roughly twice that following a high-fat breakfast, indicating that a high-fat breakfast might help to mitigate the detrimental effects of poor sleep on postprandial glycaemia. Although comparing areas may have its drawbacks, for those whose sleep is often compromised, these effects may be cumulative.Thus, over time, there may be a meaningful clinical impact on glycaemic health. Nevertheless, because of the short duration of the current study, we are not able to assess this hypothesis. Much of the research linking poor sleep with altered glucose metabolism is based upon observational studies, meaning that the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the associations reported here are not well understood [ 33]. However, poor sleep quality (measured by sleep fragmenta- tion in healthy volunteers) appears to alter glucose responses through shifting sympathovagal balance and morning cortisol levels, which could in turn lead to decreased insulin sensitiv- ity, increased hepatic glucogenesis and decreased insulin secretion [ 33]. In addition to cortisol levels, growth hormone, the secretion of which is sleep-dependent and which is essen- tial for metabolic regulation, could also be at play [ 34 36]. Moreover, the glucose intolerance observed elsewhere in sleep-deprived individuals may derive from dysregulation of sympathetic and parasympathetic control of pancreatic func- tion [ 37].

The distribution of meal types was imbalanced, with high-fat and high-carbohydrate standardised meals having the highest number of entries. Thus, it is possible that analyses focused on the non-high-carbohydrate and non-high-fat meals may have lacked statistical power. An additional limitation is that owing to the free-living nature of the trial, physical activ- ity levels varied within and between individuals, which may have interacted with sleep and meal type to affect blood glucose concentrations, a hypothesis that our study was not powered to examine. Future studies assessing the impact of sleep stages on post- prandial blood glucose levels are likely to extend the findings of the current analysis, as would exploration of these effects in individuals who are sleep-deprived owing to shift work or endogenous sleep disorders such as sleep apnoea. Conclusion Overall, this study suggests that sleep duration, quality and midpoint are important modifiable lifestyle features for improving postprandial glucose metabolism in healthy adults. As a consequence, this study s findings may inform lifestyle strategies to improve postprandial blood glucose levels, focus- ing on earlier bedtime routines and maximising high-quality uninterrupted sleep. A combination of both generalised and more personalised sleep guidelines is likely required to ensure optimal metabolic health per se and maximise the effective- ness of guidelines for diabetes prevention.

In this secondary analysis of a repeated measures, nutritional intervention study, we tested whether an individual s sleep quality, duration and timing impact glycaemic response to a breakfast meal the following morning. Methods Healthy adults data ( = 953 [41% twins]) were analysed from the PREDICT dietary intervention trial. Participants consumed isoenergetic standardised meals over 2 weeks in the clinic and at home. Actigraphy was used to assess sleep variables (duration, efficiency, timing) and continuous glucose monitors were used to measure glycaemic variation (>8000 meals). Results Sleep variables were significantly associated with postprandial glycaemic control (2 h incremental AUC), at both between- and within-person levels. Sleep period time interacted with meal type, with a smaller effect of poor sleep on postpran- dial blood glucose levels when high-carbohydrate (low fat/protein) ( pinteraction =0 . 0 2 ) a n d h i g h - f a t ( pinteraction = 0.03) breakfasts were consumed compared with a reference 75 g OGTT. Within-person sleep period time had a similar interaction (high carbohydrate: pinteraction =0 . 0 0 1 , h i g h f a t : pinteraction = 0.02). Within- and between-person sleep efficiency were significantly associated with lower postprandial blood glucose levels irrespective of meal type (both < 0.03). Later sleep midpoint (time deviation from midnight) was found to be significantly associated with higher postprandial glucose, in both between-person and   \n",

Conclusions/interpretation Poor sleep efficiency and later bedtime routines are associated with more pronounced postprandial glycaemic responses to breakfast the following morning. A person s deviation from their usual sleep pattern was also associated with poorer postprandial glycaemic control. These findings underscore sleep as a modifiable, non-pharmacological therapeutic target for the optimal regulation of human metabolic health. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03479866.

Sleep disor- ders often coalesce with other health ailments, and in this way provide a barometer of general health [ 1]. Sleep has direct causal effects on many life-threatening diseases such as CVD, obesity and type 2 diabetes [ 2 5]. Its disturbance (such as obstructive sleep apnoea) is associated with type 2 diabetes prevalence and complications [ 6] and can disrupt glucose homeostasis [ 7]. These and other data [ 8 10] point to a strong link between sleep quality/duration and glucose homeostasis. However, while there have been numerous large prospective cohort studies focused on the relationship between self- reported sleep, disease and wellbeing, objective data on sleep and postprandial glucose metabolism typically emanates from small studies conducted in tightly controlled settings and in specific population subgroups such as those suffering sleep disturbances owing to pregnancy, sleep apnoea, depression,obesity or diabetes [ 11]. Thus, the evidence base for potential recommendations concerning the effects of sleep on glucose metabolism in generally healthy people has considerable scope for expansion. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation- ship between sleep (duration, efficiency and midpoint) and postprandial glycaemic response to breakfasts of varying macronutrient composition in healthy adults from the UK and USA. Given the established role of sleep in glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes [ 12], we hypothesised that shorter sleep duration and poorer quality sleep would be associated with higher 2 h postprandial glucose incremental AUC (iAUC). We also hypothesised that there would be an   \n",

Metabolic responses to various foods differing in macronutrient and energy content were determined in relation to each partici- pant s meal timing and sleep, as well as a range of biological characteristics [ 13]. The study was conducted between June 2018 and May 2019 and included 1002 generally healthy participants aged 18 65 years in the UK, as well as 100 gener- ally healthy participants in the USA, with data being combined as there were no differences of effects for the two locations. Some of the UK participants were recruited from the TwinsUK research cohort, which includes both monozy- gotic twin (sharing the vast majority of their DNA sequence) and dizygotic twins (sharing roughly half of their DNA sequence) [ 14]. Healthy was defined as being free of diag- nosed diseases from the exclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria were as follows: ongoing inflammatory disease; cancer in the last 3 years (excluding skin cancer); long-term gastrointestinal disorders; taking immunosuppressants; using proton-pump inhibitors; diabetes; depression; eating disorder; and pregnan- cy. A full description of the PREDICT1 study protocol, including the rationale for the sample size, can be found else- where [ 13]. The current report describes secondary analyses of the PREDICT1 trial. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee and Integrated Research Application System (IRAS 236407) and from the Institutional Review Board (Partners Healthcare IRB 2018P002078) in the UK and USA, respectively. Written informed consent was obtain- ed from each participant immediately prior to enrolment in the trial during the baseline clinic visit. Test meal challenges Participants consumed standardised test meals of different nutritional composition (carbohydrates, fat, protein and dietary fibre). The meals were consumed either for breakfast   \n",
       "68      were requested to consume all their meals within 10 min, with the exception of the OGTT, which was to be consumed within 5 min. Participants were also requested to limit physical exer- cise during the 3 h period following the meal, as well as during the 8 h fasting period prior to its consumption. More detailed explanation of the test meal challenge protocol can be found elsewhere [ 13]. In this analysis, we included only the logged meals that complied with the protocol and passed logging accuracy assessment conducted by the study staff [ 13]. For example, overnight fasting was manually checked for each user, with the accuracy of meal being marked down if the time between last logged food the day before and the first on the following day was less than 8 h. Since glucose tolerance differs across the day owing to circadian effects that are independent of sleep [ 15], we excluded all meals except those consumed at breakfast from the analyses, thereby reducing non-sleep- related circadian effects on glucose regulation [ 15 17]. The OGTT was used as the reference meal type in the linear mixed-effects models, as the OGTT is the reference standard for assessing post-load glycaemic control in clinical settings. Sleep assessment Activity and sleep were monitored using a wearable device with a triaxial accelerometer (AX3, Axivity; Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK). Accelerometers were fitted by trained research staff on the non-dominant wrist and were worn by the partic- ipants for the duration of the entire study. Raw accelerometer data were analysed using GGIR, a multi-day raw accelerometer data analysis package in R [ 18, 19]. The raw accelerometer data from a wrist actigraphy units were converted into a single activity time series (BFEN) aggregated into epochs of 30 s. Sleep/wake detection was performed using the validated angle-z method implemented in GGIR [ 19]. Based on prior evidence linking sleep with metabolic system regulation [ 12], primary a priori target vari- ables were as follows: (1) sleep duration or total sleep period   \n",
       "108                                time (SPT); (2) sleep efficiency (SE), where SE represents the ratio of time asleep to the total SPT; and (3) sleep midpoint, or the middle time point between bedtime and waking up (expressed in hours as a deviation from midnight). Sleep predictors were further decomposed into within-person effects (as opposed to between-person effects) using person-mean centring [ 20]. In the context of this study, such person-mean centring translated into the person s 2 week average and his/ her deviation from that average on a particular day. A set of filtering conditions consistent with the practices of typical sleep analysis was applied to remove entries with inva- lid sleep data [ 21]. Nights with <2 h or >15 h of sleep or with SE <20% were excluded from the analysis, as they likely resulted from artefacts or poor-quality data (355 nights [2.5%]). Nights with more than 10% data classified as invalidwere also excluded (399 nights [2.8%]). In addition, nights with a sleep onset during 08:00 17:00 h or a sleep offset after 00:00 h were excluded (26 nights [0.2%]). Finally, data from participants with less than 7 days of data and/or a percentage of invalid nights >35% ( = 89) were removed. We also removed data from participants who travelled in different time zones during the study, owing to disruption of their regular sleep patterns. Glucose assessment Postprandial blood glucose was computed using a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) wearable device (Freestyle Libre Pro; Abbott, Abbott Park, IL, USA), which measures interstitial glucose every 15 min. Monitors were fitted by trained research staff to the participant s upper non-dominant arm and were worn for the entire study duration. Owing to the CGM s cali- bration requirements, CGM data collected 12 h after fitting the device to a participant was used for analysis [ 13]. Incremental area under the blood glucose curve has been shown to accurately describe glycaemic responses to foods [ 22]. Accordingly, the primary outcome for this analysis was 2 h iAUC   \n",
       "177        variables (SE, SPT, sleep midpoint); (2) standardised meal type; (3) sex; (4) age; (5) BMI; (6) zygosity (not a twin, monozygotic, dizygotic); (7) weekend; and (8) season; and (9) when applicable, sleep variable and standardised meal type interaction term to assess the combined effect of sleep variable and meal type on postprandial glucose metabolism. For random effects terms, we use d participant ID (randomly generated study identification [ID] number) and family ID to allow for person-specific linear regressions, where partici- pants have their own intercepts for the association of interest. Participant ID was nested within family ID to account for the data s nested/hierarchical structure and the fact that measures coming from twins belonging to the same family might be more similar to each other owing to genetic and/or environ- mental factors. The models had random intercepts but no random slopes. Visual inspection of diagnostic plots did not reveal any strong deviations from homoscedasticity or normality, and all models were checked for multicollinearity. The main hypotheses tested were as follows: (1) whether the relationship between sleep (quality, timing or duration) and blood glucose is statistically different from the null hypothesis of no effect; and (2) whether the relationship between sleepand postprandial glycaemic response differs in magnitude conditional on the type of br eakfast consumed. ESM Methods provides R codes for each of the main hypothesis tests. Owing to the hypothesis-driven nature of the analyses reported here, we considered a nominal value threshold of 0.05 to be of statistical significance. Results Participant characteristics Data from 953 participants were used to analyse 8395 sleep and postprandial responses (Fig. 1,T a b l e 1). Consort diagrams for the PREDICT1 study can be found elsewhere [ 26]. To provide insights into the effects of sleep on postprandial glycaemic control at both within-individual and group level, we present these two sets of resul ts separately. All models were   \n",
       "218               SPT Between-participant effects We found no statistically signifi- cant association between SPT and glucose iAUC0-2h (ESM Table 1). However, we found a statistically significantinteraction between SPT and meal type, with SPT having a significantly negative association with glucose iAUC0-2h following high-carbohydrate and high-fat breakfasts ( SPT × high carb = 1.10, SPT × high carb =0 . 0 2 1 ; SPT × high fat 40g = 1.07, SPT × high fat 40g =0 . 0 3 1 ) ( F i g . 2and ESM Table 1). Within-participant effects The person-centred model revealed an effect similar to that of the between-person model, suggest- ing that an SPT that exceeded a person s average SPT is asso- ciated with lower postprandial response following a high- carbohydrate or high-fat breakfast ( SPT-person × high carb = 1.84, SPT-person × high carb = 0.001; SPT-person × high fat 40g= 1.36, SPT-person × high fat 40g = 0.019) (ESM Table 2). SE Between-participant effects A larger between-person SE was significantly associated with lower glucose iAUC0-2h ( SE= 10.48 [95% CI 19.85, 1.11], SE=0 . 0 2 8 ) ( E S M Table 3). In a model assessing the interaction of SE and meal type, higher SE was still significantly associated with lower glucose iAUC0-2h ( SE= 19.18 [95% CI 36.46, 1.91], SE = 0.030), but none of the interaction terms was statistically significant (ESM Table 3). This association remained similar after additional adjustment for SPT ( =0 . 0 1 6 ) . 468 1 0 1 2 Sleep period time Glucose 2h iAUC (mmol/l x s)Meal type OGTT High carb High fat 35g High fat 40g High fibre High protein MCM Medium fat & carb Fig. 2 Meal type and SPT interaction effects on glucose 2 h iAUC.

       "298                                       A greater within-person SE was significantly associated with lower glucose iAUC0-2h ( SE= 11.93 [95% CI SE 21.83, 2.04], SE= 0.018), meaning that achieving better than one s average SE was associated with better postprandial glycaemic control the following day (ESM Table 4). In the model with SE and meal type interac- tion term, higher within-person SE was still significantly asso- ciated with lower glucose iAUC0-2h ( SE= 29.75 [95% CI SE 52.29, 7.21], SE=0 . 0 1 0 ) ( E S M T a b l e 4). Sleep midpoint Between-participant and within-participant effects A later between-person sleep midpoint (expressed in hours as a devi- ation from midnight) was significantly associated with higher glucose iAUC ( midpoint =0 . 5 2 [ 9 5 % C I midpoint 0.04, 1.01], midpoint =0 . 0 3 5 ) ( T a b l e 2). This effect was largely driven by sleep onset (going to bed later) rather than sleep offset (waking up later) (ESM Tables 5 7). The effect ceased to be significant in a model incorpo rating an interaction term between sleep midpoint and meal type (Table 2). In the within-person effects model, having a later sleep midpoint than one s average had a similar coefficient ( midpoint = 0.51 [95% CI midpoint 0.00, 1.02], midpoint =0 . 0 5 1 ) . Discussion Here, we describe for the first time how sleep duration, quality and midpoint associate with postprandial glucose metabolism in healthy individuals. While sleep is generally recognised as one of the pillars of good health, the data reported here suggest that one-size-fits-all sleep recommendations are suboptimal, particularly in the context of postprandial glycaemic control, a key component of diabetes prevention. By analysing both between-person and within-person effects, this study provides unique and powerful insights into both population-level and person-level effects of sleep on metabolic health. Notably, our data suggest that sleep dura- tion, efficiency and midpoint are important determinants of postprandial glycaemic control at a population level, while   \n",
       "335                                                       illustrating that to optimise sleep recommendations it is likely necessary to tailor these to the individual. Diet, sleep and health are interrelated. Several studies have investigated the relationship between sleep duration and glucose metabolism in pregnant women and reported a posi- tive association between reduced sleep duration and impaired glucose metabolism [ 4,27]. However, we are not aware of any other studies to date that investigate the relationship between objectively assessed sleep characteristics and postprandial glucose metabolism in generally healthy adults. The findings from this intervention study, with repeated test meal chal- lenges, combined with objective assessments of sleep andblood glucose from a large population, complement a relative- ly small body of knowledge around a topic that is likely to be of high relevance for diabetes prevention [ 26]. Importantly, many earlier studies were undertaken in sleep laboratories with small sample size [ 11]. While the controlled environment of such studies is necessary to understand specific aspects of sleep and metabolism, the real-world, community-dwelling setting of the current study provides novel insights into how habitual sleep affects metabolic health. The main analyses in this study focused on interactions of sleep and meal type and selected the OGTT as the breakfast against which all other breakfast meals were compared. This is primarily because the OGTT is the standard clinical test used to assess glucose tolerance. While this is not a realistic break- fast meal, there is a growing trend, particularly among youn- ger people [ 28], to consume energy drinks as a pick-me-up the morning after a poor night s sleep, with the sugar content of a 75 g OGTT equating to roughly two to three servings of stan- dard energy drinks. SPT With SPT being a marker of sleep duration, the lack of a significant marginal effect in the model without interactions indicates that sleep duration is not a major determinant of   \n",
       "392                            sleep [ 30]. As for the within-person SPT model, our findings suggest that both a longer SPT in general, as well as having a longer SPT than one is used to, are associated with improved postprandial glycaemic control the following morning. The pres- ence of a significant finding wi th the SPT × high-carbohydrate meal interaction term in the person-centred model suggests that getting more sleep than usual might be more important for post- prandial glycaemic control than the absolute amount of sleep achieved. This insight offers a potential avenue for personalised (within-person) sleep interventions. SE Better SE, between-person as well as within-person, was signif- icantly associated with lower glucose iAUC, meaning that better SE, which is a proxy of sleep quali ty, was associated with better glucose management following breakfast. However, the absence of SE × meal interactions suggests that SE may be beneficial for postprandial glucose response irrespective of meal composition. Although there is not much research on SE and glucose metab- olism in healthy adults, our findings concur with a recent meta- analysis in which poor sleep quality was associated with poor glycaemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes [ 12]. Moreover, since SE can be viewed as a proxy for sleep quality, and because we found a significant association between SE and glucose regulation, but not between SPT and glucose regulation, our findings suggest that sleep quality is more important than sleep duration with respect to glycaemic control. However, sleep apnoea is known to affect SE, and sleep apnoea was not measured in the PREDICT1 study. Sleep midpoint The presence of significant effects in both between-person and within-person sleep midpoint models adjusted for sleep dura- tion suggests a novel finding that later sleep midpoint, such as that caused by going to bed later, is associated with impaired postprandial glucose response to breakfast the following morning. This concurs with the proposition that human meta-   \n",
       "429                    bolic health is determined to a considerable extent by chrono- biology [ 31]. Alternatively, later sleep midpoint may reflect alteration of sleep stages caused by going to bed later. Thus, the significance of later sleep midpoint may also be indicative of the role of specific sleep stages, such as slow-wave sleep, on glucose metabolism, supporting the view that treating slow-wave sleep disorders may help improve glycaemic control [ 32]. The 2 h glucose iAUC response to an OGTT breakfast is roughly twice that following a high-fat breakfast, indicating that a high-fat breakfast might help to mitigate the detrimental effects of poor sleep on postprandial glycaemia. Although comparing areas may have its drawbacks, for those whose sleep is often compromised, these effects may be cumulative.Thus, over time, there may be a meaningful clinical impact on glycaemic health. Nevertheless, because of the short duration of the current study, we are not able to assess this hypothesis. Much of the research linking poor sleep with altered glucose metabolism is based upon observational studies, meaning that the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the associations reported here are not well understood [ 33]. However, poor sleep quality (measured by sleep fragmenta- tion in healthy volunteers) appears to alter glucose responses through shifting sympathovagal balance and morning cortisol levels, which could in turn lead to decreased insulin sensitiv- ity, increased hepatic glucogenesis and decreased insulin secretion [ 33]. In addition to cortisol levels, growth hormone, the secretion of which is sleep-dependent and which is essen- tial for metabolic regulation, could also be at play [ 34 36]. Moreover, the glucose intolerance observed elsewhere in sleep-deprived individuals may derive from dysregulation of sympathetic and parasympathetic control of pancreatic func- tion [ 37]. Strengths and limitations This study significantly extends our understanding of the interplay between sleep and metabolic health. First, the fairly   \n",
       "488                              accurate as polysomnography in estimating sleep duration and efficiency and does not offer insight into individual sleep stages. The distribution of meal types was imbalanced, with high-fat and high-carbohydrate standardised meals having the highest number of entries. Thus, it is possible that analyses focused on the non-high-carbohydrate and non-high-fat meals may have lacked statistical power. An additional limitation is that owing to the free-living nature of the trial, physical activ- ity levels varied within and between individuals, which may have interacted with sleep and meal type to affect blood glucose concentrations, a hypothesis that our study was not powered to examine. Future studies assessing the impact of sleep stages on post- prandial blood glucose levels are likely to extend the findings of the current analysis, as would exploration of these effects in individuals who are sleep-deprived owing to shift work or endogenous sleep disorders such as sleep apnoea. Conclusion Overall, this study suggests that sleep duration, quality and midpoint are important modifiable lifestyle features for improving postprandial glucose metabolism in healthy adults. As a consequence, this study s findings may inform lifestyle strategies to improve postprandial blood glucose levels, focus- ing on earlier bedtime routines and maximising high-quality uninterrupted sleep. A combination of both generalised and more personalised sleep guidelines is likely required to ensure optimal metabolic health per se and maximise the effective- ness of guidelines for diabetes prevention.

The study found that sleep duration, quality, and midpoint are important factors that can affect glucose levels after meals. Specifically, the study suggests that earlier bedtime routines and high-quality sleep can improve postprandial glucose metabolism. These findings may inform lifestyle strategies to improve metabolic health and prevent diabetes.

       "response_01  This paper examines the relationship between sleep patterns and postprandial glucose metabolism in healthy adults. The study found that sleep duration, quality, and midpoint are important factors that can affect glucose levels after meals. Specifically, the study suggests that earlier bedtime routines and high-quality sleep can improve postprandial glucose metabolism. These findings may inform lifestyle strategies to improve metabolic health and prevent diabetes.

       "response_01  This paper explores how our daily energy needs change throughout our lives. By analyzing a large database of people aged 8 days to 95 years old, the authors found that our total daily energy expenditure is strongly related to our fat-free mass. They identified four distinct stages of metabolic development, showing that our energy needs accelerate rapidly in our first year of life, decrease slowly throughout childhood and adolescence, remain stable during adulthood, and decline in older age. This information can help shape nutrition and health strategies for people of all ages.   \n",

The study identified four metabolic life stages, starting with a rapid increase in expenditure in neonates, followed by a slow decline throughout childhood and adolescence, stability in adulthood, and decline in older adults. These findings provide new insights into human development and aging and can inform nutrition and health strategies throughout life.   \n",
