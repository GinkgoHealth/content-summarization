      "\t['\"Comparisons in the Recovery Response From Resistance Exercise Between Young and Middle-Aged Men\\n\\nDiscussion\\nResults of this study indicated no differences in the recovery response between YA and MA for any of the performance measures, nor in subjective levels of muscle pain or soreness. Furthermore, no between-group differences were observed in the inflammatory orÂ\\xa0muscle damageÂ\\xa0response to the exercise protocol. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine differences in the recovery response from high-volume resistance exercise between recreationally trained young and middle-aged adults. Our results comparing BL performance measures seem to be in agreement with other investigations, demonstrating differences in strength measures between young (23Â–29 years) and older adults (60Â–65 years) (7,15,24), and between middle-aged (41Â–42 years) and older adults (70Â–72 years) (17,18). It does seem that the decline in strength may develop during middle age. However, recovery from exercise seems to be comparable in both younger and middle-aged adults as reflected by similar changes in performance and markers ofÂ\\xa0muscle damageÂ\\xa0andÂ\\xa0inflammation. Although changes in strength may occur in middle age, recovery from exercise does seem to be maintained in recreationally trained individuals.\\nThe differences observed at BL in isometric force and the rate of force development is consistent with other investigations comparing younger and older adults (16,19,36). Although differences in age between young and middle-aged adults do seem to affect BL levels of strength, it does not seem to affect recovery from exercise. This is supported by similar patterns ofÂ\\xa0muscle damageÂ\\xa0andÂ\\xa0inflammationÂ\\xa0observed during the recovery period after the HVP. Elevations in Mb and CK concentrations are consistent with the expected physiological response from a bout of resistance exercise (9,34). These results also suggest that middle-aged recreationally active men who regularly engage inÂ\\xa0resistance trainingÂ\\xa0do not seem to be at increased risk for greater soreness orÂ\\xa0muscle damageÂ\\xa0in comparison with younger recreationally trained men.\\nSimilar response patterns were also noted in the inflammatory response for both groups. No significant elevations from BL were observed in CRP. However, significant increases in IL-6 concentrations were observed for both groups. Although CRP is an acute phase protein whose function is to activate the innate immune response and enhance phagocytosis (10), it does not seem to change after an acute bout of resistance exercise (6). Previous research has reported no significant changes in CRP concentrations afterÂ\\xa0resistance trainingÂ\\xa0protocols recruiting primarily both upper-body (31) and lower-body exercises (4) in younger men. Furthermore, previous investigations have also indicated that training experience can reduce the CRP response to an acute bout of exercise (22,35). Considering that participants in both YA and MA were recreationally trained, it is likely that this training experience may have attenuated the CRP response. Physiologically, it is consistent with the lower stress and damage that occurs with repetitive training (9,35). Interleukin-6 is an inflammatory cytokine that facilitates communication for the mobilization, proliferation, and differentiation of immune cells to the site of tissue damage (6) and has been shown to increase after exercise (11). Elevations in IL-6 are related to the intensity, duration, and mode of training (11,13,32), but the literature is inconclusive regarding the IL-6 response toÂ\\xa0resistance training. A recent study reported that a bout of high-volume resistance exercise (8 sets of 10 repetitions with 70% of maximal strength in the squat exercise) resulted in a significant elevation in IL-6 concentrations 30 min after exercise, but no changes were observed after a bout of high-intensity resistance exercise (8 sets of 3 repetitions with 90% of maximal strength in the squat exercise) in experienced, trained lifters (4). The IL-6 response observed during this investigation as a result of a bout of high-volume resistance exercise seems to be consistent with that recently reported by Bartolomei et al. (4). However, age did not seem to exacerbate nor attenuate the IL-6 response in recreationally trained participants.\\nNo differences were noted in the inflammatory orÂ\\xa0muscle damageÂ\\xa0response between YA and MA. As discussed earlier, this is likely related to the recreational training background of the participants. However, there were several limitations to the study that need to be acknowledged. The exercise protocol was performed on an isokinetic dynamometer, which may not have as much practical application as mostÂ\\xa0resistance trainingÂ\\xa0programs use dynamic constant resistance exercises. In addition, unilateral, single-joint exercise recruited a relatively smaller muscle mass than is commonly used in most training programs. The use of this modality of exercise, which has been demonstrated to be very effective in elicitingÂ\\xa0muscle damageÂ\\xa0(20,30), may not have been sufficient to elicit significant performance and inflammatory changes in these recreationally trained participants. Future research should examine modes of training specific to the typical training program of the participants.\\nPractical Applications\\nThe results of this study indicate that changes in muscle performance seem to begin during middle age, even in recreationally trained individuals. However, participating in recreationalÂ\\xa0resistance trainingÂ\\xa0may mitigate any alteration in the recovery response from exercise. These results should be examined in the context that recovery was investigated after a unilateral, single-joint isokinetic exercise protocol. Although this method has been previously used as an effective mode of exercise to elicitÂ\\xa0muscle damage, it is not specific to the type of exercises typically used by recreational lifters. Future studies may wish to compare these population groups using multijoint, dynamic constant resistance exercises common to the training programs of most recreational lifters, regardless of age.\\n\"', '\"Daily Energy Expenditure through the Human Life Course\\n[This appears to be the discussion]:\\nIn addition to providing empirical measures and predictive equations for total expenditure from infancy to old age (Tables S1,Â\\xa0S2), our analyses bring to light major changes in metabolic rate across the life course. To begin, we can infer fetal metabolic rates from maternal measures during pregnancy: if body size-adjusted expenditures were elevated in the fetus, then adjusted expenditures for pregnant mothers, particularly late in pregnancy when the fetus accounts for a substantial portion of a motherÂ’s weight, would be likewise elevated. Instead, the stability of adjusted total and basal expenditures at ~100% during pregnancy (Figure 2B) indicates that the growing fetus maintains a fat free mass- and fat mass-adjusted metabolic rate similar to adults, which is consistent with adjusted expenditures of neonates (both ~100%;Â\\xa0Figure 2) in the first weeks after birth. Total and basal expenditures, both absolute and size-adjusted values, then accelerate rapidly over the first year. This early period of metabolic acceleration corresponds to a critical period in early development in which growth often falters in nutritionally-stressed populations (19). Increasing energy demands could be a contributing factor.\\nAfter rapid acceleration in total and basal expenditure during the first year, adjusted expenditures progressively decline thereafter, reaching adult levels at ~20 yr. Elevated adjusted expenditures in this life stage may reflect the metabolic demands of growth and development. Adult expenditures, adjusted for body size and composition, are remarkably stable, even during pregnancy and post-partum. Declining metabolic rates in older adults could increase the risk of weight gain. However, neither fat mass nor percentage increased in this period (Figure S3), consistent with the hypothesis that energy intake is coupled to expenditure (20).\\nFollowing previous studies (21Â–25), we calculated the effect of organ size on basal expenditure over the lifespan (Methods). At rest, the tissue-specific metabolic rates (Watts/gram) of the heart, liver, brain, and kidneys are much greater than those of the muscles and other lean tissue or fat (21Â–25). Organs with a high tissue-specific metabolic rate, particularly the brain and liver, account for a greater proportion of fat free mass in young individuals, and thus organ-based basal expenditure, estimated from organ size and tissue-specific metabolic rate, follows a power-law relationship with fat free mass, roughly consistent with observed basal expenditures (Methods,Â\\xa0Figure S6). Still, observed basal expenditure exceeded organ-based estimates by ~30% in early life (1 Â– 20 y) and was ~20% lower than organ-based estimates in subjects over 60 y (Figure S6), consistent with previous work indicating that tissue-specific metabolic rates are elevated in children and adolescents (22,Â\\xa024) and reduced in older adults (21,Â\\xa023,Â\\xa025).\\nWe investigated the contributions of daily physical activity and changes in tissue-specific metabolic rate to total and basal expenditure using a simple model with two components: activity and basal expenditure (Figure 3;Â\\xa0Methods). Activity expenditure was modeled as a function of physical activity and body mass, assuming activity costs are proportional to weight, and could either remain constant at adult levels over the lifespan or follow the trajectory of daily physical activity measuredÂ\\xa0viaÂ\\xa0accelerometry, peaking at 5 Â– 10 y and declining thereafter (11,Â\\xa026,Â\\xa027) (Figure 3). Similarly, basal expenditure was modeled as a power function of fat free mass (consistent with organ-based BEE estimates;Â\\xa0Methods) multiplied by a Â“tissue specific metabolismÂ” term, which could either remain constant at adult levels across the lifespan or follow the trajectory observed in adjusted basal expenditure (Figure 2). For each scenario, total expenditure was modeled as the sum of activity and basal expenditure (Methods).\\nModels that hold physical activity or tissue-specific metabolic rates constant over the lifespan do not reproduce the observed patterns of age-related change in absolute or adjusted measures of total or basal expenditure (Figure 3). Only when age-related changes in physical activity and tissue-specific metabolism are included does model output match observed expenditures, indicating that variation in both physical activity and tissue-specific metabolism contribute to total expenditure and its components across the lifespan. Elevated tissue-specific metabolism in early life may be related to growth or development (22,Â\\xa024). Conversely, reduced expenditures in later life may reflect a decline in organ level metabolism (23,Â\\xa025,Â\\xa028).\\nMetabolic models of life history commonly assume continuity in tissue-specific metabolism over the life course, with cellular metabolic rates increasing in a power-law manner (Energy =Â\\xa0aMassb) and the energy available for growth during the juvenile period made available for reproduction in adults (29,Â\\xa030). Measures of humans here challenge this view, with size adjusted metabolism elevated ~50% in childhood compared to adults (including pregnant females), and ~25% lower in the oldest subjects. It remains to be determined whether these fluctuations occur in other species. In addition to affecting energy balance, nutritional needs, and body weight, these metabolic changes present a potential target for clinical investigation into the kinetics of disease, pharmaceutical activity, and healing, processes intimately related to metabolic rate. Further, there is considerable metabolic variation among individuals, with TEE and its components varying more than Â± 20% even when controlling for fat free mass, fat mass, sex, and age (Figure 1,Â\\xa0?,2,2,Â\\xa0Table S2). Elucidating the processes underlying metabolic changes across the life course and variation among individuals may help reveal the roles of metabolic variation in health and disease.\\n\"', '\"Exercise Snacks A Novel Strategy to Improve Cardiometabolic Health\\n\\nTHE EFFICACY OF EXERCISE SNACKS FOR IMPROVING CRF IN INACTIVE ADULTS\\n\\nOur first exercise snacks study (15) was developed based on previous work showing a ~1 MET improvement in CRF after a 6-wk stair climbing protocol that involved 3 Ã— 20-s hard efforts over a 10-min period performed 3 dÂ·wk?1 (26). In the subsequent study (15), we exposed previously inactive young adults to an intervention involving either three daily bouts of vigorous stair climbing performed 1Â–4 h apart on 3 dÂ·wk?1 or a no-exercise control (n = 12 per group) (15). For each stair-based exercise snack, participants were instructed to safely ascend 60 steps in a three-flight stairwell as quickly as possible. Each exercise snack was preceded by a dynamic warm-up (10 jumping jacks, 10 air squats, and 5 lunges on each side) and followed by a 1-min walking cooldown. After the 6-wk intervention, there were modest, albeit significant, improvements in CRF as measured using cycling V?O2peak and peak power output in the exercise snacks group as compared with control (15). CRF and peak power output values in the exercise snacks group were ~5% and ~12% higher postintervention, respectively, as compared with baseline. Of note, the vigorous exercise snacks elicited mean RPE values corresponding to a Â“hardÂ” effort (5 Â± 1 on the Borg CR10 scale) and mean HR responses equating ~85% of the age-predicted maximum over the course of the training intervention (15).\\n\\nThe potential for exercise snacks to improve CRF (15) was confirmed in a study involving three isolated 20-s Â“all-outÂ” cycling bouts (each with a 2-min warm-up and 1-min cooldown) performed 1Â–4 h apart (17). V?O2peak and time-trial performance improved by ~4% and ~9%, respectively, over a 6-wk period in a group of 12 inactive adults (17). The CRF and performance gains with cycling-based exercise snacks seemed to be similar in magnitude to those observed in participants who were randomized to a traditional SIT protocol in this study, although the study was admittedly underpowered for between-group comparisons (Fig. 1). These results suggest that the vigorous nature of these protocols may be a more important adaptive stimulus than performing successive bouts of fatiguing exercise within a short period. In support of this supposition, an isolated 10-s sprint is sufficient to alter the concentration of intramuscular metabolites (27), and a 30-s sprint activates key intracellular signaling cascades involved in mediating training adaptation (e.g., adenosine monophosphate (AMP)Â–activated protein kinase) (28). These findings extended earlier work in 18 middle-aged females demonstrating a ~14% improvement in V?O2peak when three isolated 30-s Wingate tests undertaken 4 h apart were performed thrice weekly over an 8-wk period (29).\\n\\nTaken together, evidence gleaned from the aforementioned studies suggests that vigorous exercise snacks are an effective strategy to improve CRF and indices of exercise performance in previously inactive adults. Despite participants in our studies still being considered physically inactive based on the recently revised Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (i.e., by completing exercise snacks, they would not necessarily achieve 150 min of moderate-intensity or 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both each week (30)), the CRF gains conferred by the exercise snacks approach would still be expected to have health benefits (2). Importantly, for the adoption of exercise snacks by the general population outside the laboratory, the CRF gains attained using the exercise snacks approach do not require all-out efforts (15) and are apparent using both cycling-based exercise snacks and a more practical stair-based snack protocol that can be easily implemented in a home-, school-, or office-based setting.\\n\\nTHE FEASIBILITY OF EXERCISE SNACKS IN PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL POPULATIONS\\nSedentary behavior is linked to adverse metabolic outcomes independent of CRF and physical activity levels (3,10,11), and evidence from both observational and interventional studies supports the health benefits of interrupting sedentary time with bouts of low- to moderate-intensity physical activity such as walking (12Â–14). Although these strategies effectively mitigate the cardiometabolic health defects arising from sedentary behavior, practical lifestyle approaches that break up prolonged periods of inactivity while simultaneously improving in CRF in populations at risk for, or diagnosed with, cardiometabolic disease (e.g., type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease) are presently limited. Relatedly, a large proportion of individuals in this demographic are elderly and have low physical fitness levels or other disease-related risk factors that may prevent participation in traditional forms of exercise that are typically well suited for healthy adults. Thus, there is an urgent need for feasible exercise strategies that can effectively improve cardiometabolic health in these populations.\\n\\nRecent work from our laboratory supports the feasibility and efficacy of vigorous exercise snacks to disrupt prolonged periods of inactivity and improve cardiometabolic health markers in preclinical and clinical populations. Using a randomized crossover design, we demonstrated that breaking up 9 h of sitting with hourly bouts of vigorous stair-based exercise snacks (~15Â–30 s) significantly reduced the area under the curve for insulin by ~17% and nonesterified fatty acids by ~21% in 11 adults with overweight/obesity (Fig. 2) (16). Unlike our previous studies (15,17), we opted not to include a warm-up and cooldown in this study to capture what an exercise snack may look like in the real world. These preliminary findings are reinforced by a recent study from Wolfe et al. (31) that reported improvements in some measures of metabolic control when 8 h of continuous sitting was compared with a condition where participants performed 5 Ã— 4-second maximal cycling sprints on a specialized ergometer, once per hour. Breaking up prolonged sitting with hourly sprints resulted in a ~31% reduction in postprandial plasma triglycerides and 43% increase in fat oxidation after the consumption of a high-fat meal on the morning after the experimental trial (31). The exercise protocol was not strictly an exercise snacks study per our definition here, however, because it involved a total of 20 s of maximal intensity cycling over ~4Â–5 min once per hour. Other reports also show the feasibility of short practical bouts of stair-based vigorous exercise in individuals with type 2 diabetes (32) and coronary artery disease (33,34), and research into the potential of exercise snacks for improving metabolic outcomes in clinical populations represents a promising avenue for future work. It will also be of interest to examine how the more vigorous exercise snacks approach discussed here compares to breaking up prolonged sitting with frequent light- to moderate-activity breaks Â— an approach that has previously demonstrated benefits for improving markers of metabolic control in individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes (12,14,20,35).\\n\\nTHE POTENTIAL FOR EXERCISE SNACKS TO IMPROVE VASCULAR HEALTH\\nIn addition to causing metabolic disruptions, prolonged sitting also reduces leg blood flow and shear stress Â— factors implicated in endothelial dysfunction and the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (36,37). The detrimental effects of sedentary behavior on vascular function can be mitigated when exercise is undertaken before (38), during (39), or immediately after (40) an extended bout of prolonged sitting. In this regard, recent work from our laboratory also supports the potential for exercise snacks to improve vascular function during extended periods of sitting. Caldwell et al. (18) exposed 10 healthy males to ~8.5 h of sitting with or without hourly stair-based exercise snacks involving ~14Â–20 s of ascending three flights of stairs at a brisk speed. Significant improvements in femoral artery hemodynamics, but not flow-mediated dilation (FMD), were apparent when prolonged sitting was interrupted with hourly exercise snacks, as reflected by ~32% higher blood flow and vascular conductance and a ~15% increase in shear rate (18) (Fig. 3). Although we are unaware of other studies examining vascular function in response to the exercise snacks approach as defined here, our work is supported by recent observations of improved popliteal artery blood flow and shear rate in healthy adults when a postprandial 4-h sitting period is interrupted with hourly 5-min bouts of vigorous stair climbing (23). Notably, the longer stair climbing bouts used by Cho et al. (23) also offset the reduction in FMD during prolonged sitting, suggesting that longer acute bouts of exercise may be required to elicit favorable effects on this parameter of vascular function. Taken together, these findings support the potential of exercise snacks to favorably impact vascular health, although additional studies are required to confirm the findings presented here, particularly with regard to the effects of exercise snacks on vascular and endothelial function.\\n\\nWHERE DO EXERCISE SNACKS FIT IN?\\nExercise snacks align with the recently revised Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines on Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior (30,41). In recognition of the potential health benefits of short bouts of physical activity, the updated recommendations from these and other organizations eliminated the previous requirement that physical activity had to be accumulated in bouts lasting at least 10-min minimum (30,41). In line with this recommendation, other work has demonstrated the maintenance of health benefits when splitting longer sessions of continuous exercise into shorter bouts dispersed over the course of the day (42). Stamatakis et al. (43) recently proposed a framework encouraging four pillars of research to better understand the health benefits of a strategy called Â“vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activityÂ” (VILPA). These authors define VILPA as a single session of vigorous activity (?14 or 15 on the Borg 6Â–20 scale or >6 MET) lasting no more than 5 min performed as part of activities of daily living or other lifestyle physical activities (43). Exercise snacks align closely with the VILPA framework in terms of their brevity, intensity, and accessibility but are technically distinct. First, unlike VILPA, exercise snacks are not purely incidental to, or inherently part of, activities of daily living but rather can be planned or structured within lifestyle activities Â— a distinction that still preserves the important aspects of feasibility and accessibility upon which VILPA is based. Exercise snacks also embody key elements of exercise that are not necessarily part of VILPA Â— namely, structure (?1 min in duration and performed as a hard effort), planning (required some anticipation or decision making), repetition (must be performed multiple times over the day), and intention (performed for the improvement of cardiometabolic health) Â— further distinguishing them from the VILPA approach. Nonetheless, it becomes somewhat difficult to delineate between a purposeful exercise snack embedded within activities of daily living Â— for instance, vigorously ascending the stairs to use the restroom on a different floor in an office building or performing a set of jumping jacks during a break between virtual meetings Â— and lifestyle approaches such as incidental VILPA (e.g., carrying groceries up several flights of stairs, maximizing walking pace to the bus stop). Relatedly, although exercise snacks are sometimes compared as a more practical alternative to SIT (17), the health benefits of exercise snacks do not require Â“all outÂ” efforts and can be achieved without the use of specialized cycle ergometers (15,16,18) Â— both of which are typical components of traditional SIT protocols. As such, we believe it is most appropriate to classify exercise snacks as a distinct subset of brief vigorous exercise (6), but we also recognize that Â— as with most things in science Â— the concept of exercise snacks proposed here is not necessarily new but rather may be an alternative iteration of an idea that has likely been presented by others in different contexts, both in the past and present.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThe persistence of insufficient physical activity levels and sedentary lifestyles among the general population in modern Western societies highlights the ongoing need for feasible exercise strategies that simultaneously improve CRF and reduce the impact of sedentariness on cardiometabolic health. Based on the emerging evidence presented in this article, we propose that exercise snacks Â— defined here as isolated bouts of brief vigorous exercise performed multiple times throughout the day Â— may be one such strategy (Fig. 4). Exercise snacks involving thrice daily ~15Â–30 s of hard effort involving cycling and more practical stair climbing are efficacious for improving CRF and exercise performance in inactive adults. Exercise snacks may also have potential to improve aspects of cardiometabolic health in individuals with obesity, but their efficacy in clinical populations remains to be established as existing reports have studied a small number of participants in laboratory-based settings. Relatedly Â— and perhaps most importantly Â— the applicability of exercise snacks in a Â“real-worldÂ” (e.g., in home-, office-, or work-based) setting and the potential for exercise snacks to target musculoskeletal health remain to be determined.\\n\\nPage 1 of 1\\n\\n\"', '\"Food craving, cortisol and ghrelin responses in modeling highly palatable snack intake in the laboratory\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nThis preliminary study is the first to directly compare the effects of both food cue and stress exposure on HP food craving and HP food intake in a 3-day human laboratory experiment conducted within a controlled hospital-based setting with healthy community adults. As both the ubiquitous HP food environment and stressors are known to increase HP food intake and obesity risk, a direct comparison of these contexts could identify similar and differential processes that may underlie food motivation and intake. As hypothesized, and similar to our previous work in addiction [18], we found that exposure to both personal food cues and to personal stressors relative to a neutral relaxing control cue resulted in increases in HP food craving and subsequent increased snacking of HP foods in a standardized Food Snack Test (FST), but with differential effects in lean and overweight BMI groups. Furthermore, we found that increased food craving in these contexts was highly associated with subsequent amounts of HP food snack intake. Finally, both ghrelin and cortisol were found to significantly impact food motivation but differentially across lean and overweight individuals. Together, these results support the need for further investigation of biobehavioral processes underlying HP food motivation and intake, especially in the context of weight-related physiological adaptations.\\nExposure to food cue imagery led to significant increases in HP food craving prior to the presentation of the FST at the pre-snack timepoint in both lean and OW individuals. Moreover, food cue-related increases in food craving predicted significant increases in HP snack intake across both lean and OW individuals. These data are consistent with a significant literature indicating that rewarding stimuli and their related contexts increase motivation and wanting of rewarding stimuli via conditioning and/or incentive salience mechanisms [4,Â\\xa020,Â\\xa042]. Also, a number of basic science and human neuroimaging studies have shown that food cue stimulus exposure increases food craving and activate brain reward and motivation regions [4,Â\\xa07-11,Â\\xa018,Â\\xa043,Â\\xa044]. Current findings further indicate that such food cue-related increases in HP food craving promote HP snack intake with greater intake of HP foods in the food cue context relative to the neutral relaxing contexts across individuals. These data validate the real-world contexts of advertising of HP foods to promote greater sales and intake of HP foods.\\nIn contrast, we found a differential impact of stress on HP food craving and intake by BMI group where stress significantly increased food craving relative to the neutral condition, but only in the overweight and not the lean group. Furthermore, stress-induced HP food craving predicted subsequent HP snack intake in the overweight but not the lean group, suggesting that food motivational processes may be relevant in identifying those who are vulnerable to stress-induced eating. Previous laboratory studies have shown mixed results with some showing stress increasing food intake [17,Â\\xa024], but others reporting no consistent increases in intake [23,Â\\xa045]. While the methodology has varied across these studies, current findings suggest the need for direct comparison of BMI groups and consideration of weight-related adaptations in assessing stress effects on HP food motivation and intake. Current findings are also supported by a growing literature suggesting that BMI-related alterations impact not only metabolic hormones but also stress and reward processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake [18,Â\\xa020,Â\\xa044]. Together our findings on food cue- and stress- related effects on HP food motivation and intake suggests differential effects by BMI, that may in turn, point to different mechanisms that may drive weight gain and obesity risk in individuals who are lean versus those who are overweight.\\nOur findings also show differential effects of food cue and stress exposure on total ghrelin responses and their contribution to HP food motivation and intake. Stress and food cue exposure increased ghrelin responses, but significantly for the OW and not the LN group. Furthermore, only in the OW group was stress-induced ghrelin increases significantly associated with both HP food craving and subsequent HP food intake. While ghrelin has well known homeostatic effects on feeding function [46,Â\\xa047], recent focus has been on its role in both stress and mood regulation as well as in hedonically motivated feeding behavior, partially via its effects on mesolimbic reward circuits [37,Â\\xa048]. Findings indicate that ghrelin can shift preferences to high palatable foods and increase the motivational aspects of food reward [48]. Ghrelin is also known to increase with stress and is involved in regulating anxiety and mood (36,Â\\xa049-51). Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that ghrelin administration increases the neural response to food pictures in areas associated with hedonic eating (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and ventral tegmental area) [52]. Additionally, there is growing evidence that feed-forward circuitry between stress and food reward maybe partly mediated by ghrelin [52,Â\\xa053]. In the current study, as the effects were specific to the OW group, they suggest that weight-related adaptations in ghrelin modulated pathways could potentially shift food motivation towards hedonic regulation, especially under stress conditions.\\nFinally, our findings also showed differential effects of cortisol responses to stress and food cue exposure. Notably, there was a significant increase in cortisol in the food cue relative to the neutral condition that was due to significant increases in cortisol in the lean group and not so in the OW group. Furthermore, food cue-related increases in cortisol was associated with greater food cue-related HP craving, suggesting a role for cortisol in food motivation. While glucocorticoids are often associated with the stress response, they are also known to play an important role in energy intake and regulation. Cortisol increases have been noted with intake of specific macronutrients, including carbohydrates, fats and proteins in animals and humans [6,Â\\xa054], with the source of cortisol increases to be via both adrenal and extra-adrenal production [54]. Furthermore, in our previous neuroimaging study, increases in cortisol during a mild hypoglycemic state was associated with greater activation of brain reward regions that promoted greater food craving [44]. Together, this previous research supports current findings of the association between greater cortisol responses to food cue exposure with food cue-induced HP food craving.\\nWe did not see an overall significant increase in cortisol during stress exposure, but this was largely due to a lack of response in the OW group. Remarkably, the OW group showed blunted cortisol responses during stress and food cue relative to neutral conditions. This finding is consistent with growing evidence of blunted cortisol and autonomic responses to stress challenge in people who are OW or obese, along with altered autonomic and peripheral catecholamine responses to stress challenge in those weight groups [18,Â\\xa021-25,Â\\xa055]. HPA axis adaptations with low cortisol awakening responses have been reported in higher BMI groups, along with blunted responses to stress and reduced dopamine activity [20,Â\\xa056]. Thus, the current findings of lack of cortisol increases in the OW group leads one to speculate that such HPA axis adaptations may contribute to higher HP food craving and intake in food cue and in stress contexts. However, this is speculation and would need further testing in future studies.\\nSeveral limitations of the current study need to be considered. First, the sample size was small and thus the findings are preliminary and need further validation. Also, due to the small sample size, sex differences and differential responses within the overweight groups were not assessed. It is possible that men and women differ in their food motivation and intake responses in food cue and stress contexts as shown in previous work [26,27]. Also, continuous assessment of BMI rather than arbitrary cutoffs for individuals in the lean, overweight and obese BMI range may provide greater sensitivity in assessing weight related adaptations. Thus, research with larger samples is required to replicate current findings and address these issues. Finally, as this study was conducted while participants were in a hospital, it is not clear whether the findings are generalizable to an outpatient experimental context or to real world food motivation and intake settings. On the other hand, as food cues and stress are among the most common contexts in which overeating of HP foods occur in the real world, the current study presents a well-controlled experimental model to study the biobehavioral processes that may contribute to increased food motivation and intake of highly palatable foods. Evidence of HP food motivation and increased snacking in these contexts is consistent with reports of obesogenic environments promoting increased HP food intake and weight gain in the real world. Furthermore, positive associations of HP food craving and intake by total ghrelin and cortisol responses suggests a role for metabolic and neuroendocrine adaptations in increased HP food motivation and intake.\\n?\\nHIGHLIGHTS:\\n* This paper directly compares the effects of both food cue and stress exposure on highly palatable food craving and intake in a 3-day human laboratory experiment conducted within a controlled hospital-based setting with healthy community adults.\\n* Results show that food cues and stress exposure increases food craving and subsequent snacking of highly palatable foods, and food cravings predict subsequent highly palatable food intake.\\n* Ghrelin and cortisol hormones appear to play a role in food cue and stress related food motivation and intake.\\n* These findings suggest the need for further carefully controlled studies to understand the biobehavioral processes that drive overeating and weight gain.\\n\\n\"', '\"High doses of anti-inflammatory drugs compromise muscle strength and hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young adults.\\n\\nDiscussion \\nThe interest in this study was spurred by the intriguing observation that while NSAIDs might have a negative impact on acute exercise responses (satellite cell activity, translational signalling and protein synthesis), previous human studies have failed to demonstrate a detrimental effect of NSAIDs on the development of muscle hypertrophy in response to chronic resistance training in young adults, possibly due to differences in drug dosage across studies. Accordingly, in the current study, healthy young men and women performed 8 weeks of supervised resistance training with concomitant high- or low-dose NSAID treatment. The major and novel findings were that 1) maximal overthe-counter doses of ibuprofen compromised resistance exercise-induced muscle hypertropy\\nindependent of training mode; 2) increases in muscle strength were attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions; 3) while the resistance-training intervention resulted in several muscle molecular adaptations, the only marked difference across medical treatment was a significant ibuprofen-induced downregulation of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 mRNA, compared with an upregulation in the ASA group. This is the first study showing that daily consumption of high doses of NSAIDs attenuates strength and muscle hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young healthy individuals. We acknowledge that a limitation of the current study was that we did not include a non-treated control group. However, the increase in muscle volume (7.5%) in the ASA group was of a similar, and expected, magnitude to that previously reported by our group20 and others.21,22 In the light of this, the magnitude of the reduction in muscle hypertrophy in response to the ibuprofen treatment was quite remarkable and, if anything, should the ASA treatment have had a small effect on the adaptive response, it would only have masked an even greater difference across groups than what is reported herein. Nonetheless, given the marked effect of ibuprofen and the fact that the increase in muscle size in the control group (0.14% per day) was of similar magnitude as the average rate of hypertrophy reported in past studies employing knee-extensor resistance training,23 we are confident that our data provide strong proof-of-principle evidence that the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent of the dose of intake. The rationale for using acetylsalicylic acid instead of ibuprofen as a low-dose comparator in the current study was based on the fact that when the drug is consumed orally, it undergoes substantial presystemic hydrolysis in the gut and liver before it enters the systemic bloodstream. As the drug will, however, encounter blood in the portal circulation, low doses of acetylsalicylic acid will exert its antiplatelet effect with no or limited effect on systemic targets such as peripheral tissue.16Â–18 Consequently, the potential circulatory effects are factored out and we hypothesize that the negative effect of ibuprofen was due to muscle-specific COX inhibition rather than the antiplatelet effect achieved by both ibuprofen and low doses of acetylsalicylic acid.18,24 The results of the present study are in agreement with animal studies showing an inhibitory effect of COX inhibitors on muscle hypertrophy.8,9,25 They also agree with acute human data reporting attenuated protein synthesis,5 translational signalling13 and satellite cell activity11,12 in response to resistance training with concomitant high-dose NSAID administration. Our hypothesis of a dose-dependent effect is also supported by the only comparable training study in young healthy subjects.14 That particular study reported no effect of ibuprofen on muscle hypertrophy or strength gains after 6 weeks of training consisting of six sets of biceps curls 2Â–3 days week---------------1 . The drug dose was consumed on training days only, resulting in a total intake of 800Â–1200 mg week---------------1 , 14 compared with 1200 mg per day in the current study. This indeed highlights the potential importance of drug dosage where, evidently, intake of maximal over-the-counter doses is potent enough to interfere with the normal hypertrophic development of 0.1Â–0.2% per day seen in the ASA group as well as in other studies employing conventional resistance-training programmes for the knee extensors.23 It is generally agreed that repeated increases in muscle protein synthesis following each exercise bout is the most important mechanism underlying training-induced muscle hypertrophy.26,27 Thus, it seems plausible to suggest that the main explanation for the clear attenuation of hypertrophy, which was evident in both training modes (FW and WS), was diminished prostaglandin production and hence decreased muscle protein synthetic response after each training session in the IBU group. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that COX and prostaglandins play an important role in regulating the molecular events controlling muscle hypertrophy. For example, C2C12 myotube diameter was shown to be regulated by PGF2a in an mTORdependent manner7 , and exercise-induced increases in p70S6K (downstream of mTOR) was blunted by ibuprofen treatment in the early hours following acute resistance exercise.13 In the current study, however, there were no group interactions for any of the target proteins examined, suggesting that the ibuprofenmodulating effect on muscle adaptations is not associated with differential expression of steady-state proteins in response to chronic training. Perhaps assessing satellite cell content,11 or the phosphorylation levels of translational signalling proteins in response to acute exercise,13 would have provided more mechanistic insights. We measured several key molecular markers for COX and prostaglandin-mediated metabolism, regulators of muscle growth and atrophy, and several cytokines and myokines that have been shown to regulate skeletal muscle protein metabolism and exercise adaptations.4 The most clear-cut molecular evidence for an effect of ibuprofen on peripheral muscle tissue was the marked drug effect on IL-6 mRNA, where levels in the ibuprofen group were downregulated despite a significant upregulation in the control group. The reduction of IL-6 in the ibuprofen group is coherent with previous studies suggesting PGE2 as a stimulator of IL-6 transcription in both human muscle28 and other cell types.29 It has previously been reported that the NSAID-modulating effects on muscle hypertrophy in older subjects were associated with lowered expression of IL-6 and subsequently MuRF-1, resulting in a more beneficial cellular environment for muscle growth.30 While our data are coherent with that of Trappe and colleagues regarding the expression of IL-6 in the ibuprofen-treated group (downregulated) compared to the control group (upregulated), the muscle hypertrophy data certainly contradict these findings. In that study, elderly subjects (60Â–78 years) performed 12 weeks of resistance training with simultaneous daily ibuprofen treatment of 1200 mg. The increase in muscle size was substantially greater with ibuprofen compared with placebo,15 and this was supported by acute data showing no interference of ibuprofen on muscle protein synthesis in the same age group.31 Thus, interestingly, there may be distinct differences in the response to resistance training and NSAID consumption in the young vs. the elderly, and probably also in the mechanistic underpinnings of exercise-induced tissue remodelling in these age groups. Specifically, in the present cohort of young subjects, it is possible that blunting of important inflammatory processes, as reflected by the downregulated IL-6 gene expression, contributed to the attenuated hypertrophic response because previous studies have shown that induction of IL-6, and also other inflammatory and proteolytic factors, has an important role in muscle regenerative processes during hypertrophic conditions.32,33 In contrast, the role of inflammatory processes may be different in the elderly where an ibuprofen-induced downregulation of IL-6 could reduce chronic low-grade inflammation and thereby restore the blunted anabolic response to resistance exercise typically seen in aged populations.34 Thus, based on the current data and given the complex regulation of mRNA and protein levels,35,36 future studies should directly compare the response to resistance exercise and NSAID treatment in young vs. old populations as well as incorporate better time resolution, including both acute and chronic biopsy time points and perhaps also higher-throughput techniques, to provide more conclusive evidence of the critical mechanisms regulating the interactive effects of NSAIDs and resistance exercise on muscle adaptations. The functional data showed that increases in muscle strength were attenuated in IBU compared with ASA, but only in the FW leg. In our mind, this leads to two questions: first, if this strength difference was explained by the larger increase in muscle size in the control group, why was strength not reduced in the WS leg? Second, if not muscle size, what other mechanisms could explain the fact that strength was negatively affected by ibuprofen only in the FW leg? Regarding the first question, although muscle mass and strength are generally highly correlated at baseline in pre-training situations,37,38 the same does not necessarily apply when it comes to increases in strength and muscle size following short-term resistance training.39,40 This was also the case in the current study, where in fact the correlation between changes in muscle size and strength was very weak (R2 ~0.05; data not shown). Thus, it appears that strength gains can occur irrespective of the magnitude of increase in muscle volume and hence, this could explain why, in the WS leg, the larger increase in muscle volume for the ASA group did not result in a larger increase in strength compared with IBU. It is plausible that with longer-term training, once neural adaptations have plateaued,41 the relationship between muscle size and strength would be restored and hence the negative effect of ibuprofen on strength would be even more evident. As to the second question raised above, we did speculate beforehand that perhaps NSAID consumption could affect acute training performance and thereby the capacity to perform high-intensity repetitive work bouts. It appeared at first that the strength reduction in the FW leg was not related to a reduction in day-to-day training performance, as both groups performed an equal amount of work throughout the 8-week training programme. Interestingly, however, a closer look at the data in Figure 1 reveals that the ibuprofen group certainly showed a levelling-off effect during the last week of flywheel training, which likely explains the lower strength gains noted. Regarding the logical follow-up question of why training performance in the FW leg was negatively affected by ibuprofen only at the end of the training period, we are unable to provide a definite answer. However, given that the main differences between the two training modes is the eccentric overload, provoking greater inflammatory stimulus, and the maximal unlimited resistance provided by the flywheel device,21,42 it is tempting to speculate that one (or both) of these two features are particularly prone to ibuprofen treatment, at least after a few weeks of accumulated training. It should also be noted that day-to-day performance levels varied much more in the FW leg, indicating that this training regime was more stressful for the subjects. Alternatively, as indicated earlier, the relationship between muscle mass and strength became more important at the end of the training period, and hence, the levelling-off phenomenon in the IBU group was due to the compromised hypertrophic development. Altogether, based on the current data and given the knowledge of different time resolutions for the underlying mechanisms of muscle strength, longer training studies could clarify whether interference in muscle growth will be associated with reduced muscle strength, and whether different training modes, such as eccentric overload, are even more sensitive to concomitant NSAID treatment. Notwithstanding, our findings raise the concern that resistance-training studies employing strict work-matched increases across groups might overlook important effects of various factors such as medical treatments or supplements that would have become evident if maximal efforts had been allowed throughout each set and training session. In summary, we show for the first time that maximal over-the-counter doses of NSAIDs compromise resistance exercise-induced increases in muscle size and strength in young adults. The gains in muscle size were attenuated by ibuprofen independent of the type of training performed, whereas muscle strength was attenuated only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. Furthermore, while the resistance-training intervention resulted in several muscle molecular adaptations, the only marked difference across medical treatment was a significant ibuprofen-induced reduction in IL-6 gene expression, which in our mind reflected a changed inflammatory environment that, speculatively, contributed to the attenuated hypertrophic development in the ibuprofen group. This study improves our understanding of how NSAIDs work and interacts with chronic exercise responses, and considering the potency of the drug to modify muscle mass and function, the mechanistic findings should contribute to a better understanding of regulation of muscle growth in general. More importantly, however, the results have implications for the millions of individuals worldwide who consume NSAIDs on a regular basis while trying to obtain the best possible benefits of resistance training. \\n\\n\"', '\"Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nThis study examined the independent and combined effects of hypohydration and menstrual phase on experimental pain sensitivity in healthy eumenorrheic women, and the potential efficacy of acute water ingestion as a remedy to the deleterious impact of hypohydration. The main findings were that: 1) mild hypohydration increased pain sensitivity, 2) menstrual phase did not affect pain sensitivity, nor did it influence the effect of hypohydration on pain, and 3) acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity.\\n\\nHypohydration and Pain in Women\\nIndependent of menstrual phase, mild hypohydration following 24 h of fluid restriction reduced pain tolerance (?8%) and increased pain intensity (+13%) and pain unpleasantness (+12%) ratings at 1 min after handgrip exercise (hereafter referred to as pain ratings) during ischemic pain stimulation, when compared with euhydration. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies that showed negative effects of mild hypohydration on experimental pain sensitivity in men (7, 8). Ogino et al. (7) observed a decrease in pain thresholds (i.e., increased pain sensitivity) following a combination of exercise-induced dehydration and fluid restriction, whereas Bear et al. (8) found an increase in pain intensity ratings but no difference in pain thresholds after 24 h of fluid restriction. Therefore, the current findings extend these previous results to women by showing that mild hypohydration also increases experimental pain sensitivity in women. The previous studies also did not include pain measures that reflect the affective/emotional experience of pain (i.e., pain tolerance or pain unpleasantness ratings) that may be important for chronic pain, whereas both pain threshold and pain intensity ratings assess the sensory/discriminative aspect of pain (49, 50). Although Bear et al. (8) measured pain tolerance, the nature of the stimulus-response relationship for the cold pressor taskÂ—i.e., plateau and gradual decline in the perceived intensity of the pain stimulus (41)Â—resulted in a large proportion (?2/3) of participants who were able to tolerate the pain until the 4-min cut-off time, thereby precluding meaningful analyses of the results. This issue was not apparent with the ischemic pain test used in the present study, as there was only one instance where the 20-min time limit was reached. Therefore, the current findings further add to the previous data by showing that mild hypohydration also negatively impacts the affective/emotional aspect of pain, as evidenced by the decrease in pain tolerance and increase in pain unpleasantness ratings compared with EUH.\\n\\nThe exact mechanisms underlying the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration cannot be determined from the current data. However, one potential mechanism through which hypohydration may increase pain sensitivity is thirst perception. Geuter et al. (51) showed that an increase in thirst perceptionÂ—induced by consumption of salty snacks followed by 5 h of fluid deprivationÂ—led to an increase in pain intensity ratings during noxious heat stimulation, whereas subsequent ad libitum fluid intake, which reduced thirst perception, decreased pain ratings. In another study, stimulation of thirst sensation via hypertonic saline infusion increased pain intensity ratings during noxious pressure stimulation, which were associated with stronger activation of pain-related brain regions; namely, the anterior cingulate cortex and insula (52). Similar findings were reported in the study by Ogino et al. (7). These brain regions were previously shown to be activated and deactivated independently by an increase and decrease in thirst perception, respectively (52Â–54). However, it is not apparent from these data whether the increased pain sensitivity and pain-related brain activity were due to thirst perception per se, physiological hypohydration, or both.\\n\\nMenstrual Phase and Experimental Pain Sensitivity\\nMenstrual phase did not modulate the hyperalgesic effect of hypohydration, nor did it independently affect pain sensitivity. The lack of a menstrual phase effect on ischemic pain sensitivity is consistent with the findings of most previous studies that examined ischemic pain responses across the menstrual cycle (18, 55Â–58). In contrast, studies by Fillingim et al. (59) and Pfleeger et al. (60) observed greater pain sensitivity during the luteal compared with follicular phase. However, concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone were not measured in the study by Pfleeger et al. (60), whereas the specific definition of the luteal phase used by Fillingim et al. (59) differed from that in the current study. We examined the ML phase when concentrations of both 17?-estradiol and progesterone are elevated, whereas Fillingim et al. (59) included the late-luteal period in their classification of the luteal phase, during which concentrations of 17?-estradiol and progesterone are declining rapidly and are less stable compared with the ML phase. Given that menstrual phases characterized by fluctuating or unstable 17?-estradiol levels have been associated with increased severity of various chronic pain conditions (14), this may explain why Fillingim et al. (59) observed phase differences in pain sensitivity whereas we did not.\\n\\nThe equivocal and inconclusive results regarding menstrual phase effects on experimental pain sensitivity are thought to be due, in part, to the lack of proper verification of menstrual phases through blood measurements of 17?-estradiol and progesterone (15, 16), making it difficult to draw conclusions about the relationship between menstrual phase/hormone status and pain sensitivity. Similar to previous observations (22, 23), Sosm was lower in the ML than EF phase (Table 2); however, this phase difference in hydration did not appear to impact any of the ischemic pain measures (Figs. 1Â–3). In this study, we showed that after hydration status was controlled, menstrual phases were properly verified and potential confounders (e.g., dietary and lifestyle factors and dysmenorrhea) were minimized, there was no difference in ischemic pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases. As such, our data suggest that the hormonal fluctuations within the menstrual cycle do not greatly impact pain sensitivity.\\n\\nInterestingly, although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phase, there was a positive correlation between 17?-estradiol and pain sensitivity, suggesting that women with higher baseline levels of 17?-estradiol may be more sensitive to pain than those with lower 17?-estradiol levels (i.e., between-subject effect). However, given the weak strength of the correlation (r = ?0.32) (48), this finding should be interpreted with caution.\\n\\nEffects of Acute Water Ingestion\\nGiven that thirst perception may be a potential mechanism linking hypohydration and increased pain sensitivity, we hypothesized that acute water ingestion when hypohydrated would reduce pain sensitivity. This would also help to delineate the effects of thirst and hypohydration per se, on pain, since acute water ingestion would be expected to reduce thirst without altering hydration status (38, 61). However, contrary to our hypothesis, ischemic pain tolerance was not affected by ingestion of 5 mLÂ·kg?1 of water, despite the significant decrease in thirst perception ratings. Meanwhile, ratings of both pain intensity and pain unpleasantness increased, which may appear counterintuitive as participants reported feeling more pain despite being less thirsty. These unexpected findings may be explained by carryover (sensitization) effects from the baseline pain test. A previous study showed that repeated pain stimulation within a single session produced a sensitization effect, whereby pain ratings increased gradually with each repeated stimulation (62). Therefore, this sensitization effect may have masked potential positive effects of acute water ingestion on pain. Future studies that either utilize a longer interval between the repeated pain tests, or perform the postwater ingestion pain test on a separate day, are required to gain further understanding on the relative importance of thirst perception and physiological hypohydration on pain.\\n\\nConsiderations\\nThere are several considerations and limitations of this study that should be noted in addition to those already discussed earlier. First, only healthy, eumenorrheic women were included in this study, which ignores postmenopausal women and oral contraceptive pill users, who have different hormonal profiles compared with eumenorrheic women. Therefore, it is possible that hypohydration may affect pain sensitivity differently in these women compared with eumenorrheic women. Second, blood samples were not obtained after water ingestion to confirm that hydration status was not altered. However, previous data indicate that consuming a moderate volume of water, similar to that in the current study, does not acutely alter hydration status in hypohydrated men (38, 61). In addition, the relatively short interval of 30 min between water ingestion and the subsequent pain test was likely insufficient for hydration status to be altered, because a previous study showed that at least 75 min is required for 300 mL of water to be completely absorbed into the bloodstream (63). Third, as participants could not be blinded to the hydration intervention, the increased pain sensitivity observed during HYPO may have been confounded by nocebo effects (64, 65). Although participants were not aware of the study hypotheses, they were aware of the aims of the study, one of which was to investigate the effects of hypohydration on pain sensitivity. Given the negative connotations of hypohydration or dehydration, it is conceivable that participants would expect hypohydration to increase pain sensitivity, which may have subsequently influenced participantsÂ’ actual responses to the ischemic pain test. Fourth, the body mass change values in HYPO may not accurately reflect the fluid losses induced by the 24 h of fluid restriction. Due to the scheduling constraints that included two experimental visits within 3 days per menstrual phase, we were unable to obtain a baseline body mass at the start of the hydration intervention; thus, body mass change in HYPO was calculated using EUH body mass. As the EUH and HYPO trials within each menstrual phase were separated by at least 48 h, it is likely that the values were confounded by factors other than the change in body water content (e.g., urine and fecal losses, food and fluid consumption). Acknowledging this limitation, we obtained other measures of hydration status (i.e., Sosm, USG, copeptin, and thirst ratings) in addition to body mass change for a more accurate assessment of hydrations status. Finally, our sample size may have limited our ability to detect statistically significant menstrual phase effects on pain. As such, the effects of menstrual phase on pain require further investigation. Our study could provide a reference for future studies with a similar design to base their sample size calculations on. Nevertheless, large effect sizes (?2p\\n = 0.37Â–0.55) were obtained for the main effect of hypohydration on pain, with an observed power of 0.7Â–0.9, which suggests a low probability of false negatives.\\n\\nPerspectives and Significance\\nOur data indicate that hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women and this effect may not be reversed immediately by water ingestion. Whereas, menstrual phase (EF vs. ML) does not appear to affect pain sensitivity. These findings suggest that insufficient water intake throughout the day may exacerbate pain perception in healthy women. Given the high prevalence of hypohydration among the general population (25), future studies should investigate whether hypohydration may worsen chronic pain conditions, and the potential efficacy of maintaining adequate hydration in alleviating pain symptoms. This may be especially important for older adults, who are more likely to be hypohydrated and experience chronic pain (25, 66). For human pain researchers, controlling or measuring hydration status of participants may be important to minimize confound, as clinically and physiologically relevant tests such as the cold pressor are affected (67). Although we did not find differences in pain sensitivity between the EF and ML phases after controlling for hydration status, more high-quality research is required to accurately determine whether menstrual phase does or does not affect pain sensitivity. Therefore, until a consensus on the topic has been reached, our data do not discount the need for future pain researchers to verify menstrual phase.\\n\\n\"', '\"Recovery From Eccentric Squat Exercise in Resistance-Trained Young and Master Athletes With Similar Maximum Strength: Combining Cold Water Immersion and Compression\\n\\nDiscussion\\nThe study aimed at investigating the effects of aging on muscle soreness and muscle damage following an intensive squat exercise protocol as well as on age-related effects of a recovery intervention in tightly controlled populations of young and master athletes regarding their absolute performance level. As an important experimental precondition, all markers of fatigue and recovery showed a significant within-subject effect of time of measurement with strikingly more pronounced changes from pre- to post-exercise (Figure 2), while CK peaked at post-24 in most individuals. Usually, the highest CK activity is found at 24 or 48h post-exercise. A mean CK increase of up to two times the baseline and up to 800U/l in some individuals can be attributed to structural damage to muscle cells (Baird et al., 2012). Therefore, it can be concluded that the applied high-intensive and eccentric overloaded exercise protocol was acutely sufficiently fatiguing and well-chosen to produce ongoing muscle soreness and muscle damage, which confirms the findings from other studies (Proske and Allen, 2005;Â\\xa0Lavender and Nosaka, 2006;Â\\xa0Raeder et al., 2016a;Â\\xa0Bridgeman et al., 2017;Â\\xa0Thomas et al., 2018).\\nRegarding the first hypothesis, the master athletes neither reach higher fatigue levels nor recover more slowly than the younger athletes (rejection of hypothesis 1). These findings partly contradict the current literature suggesting that, for a similar exercise stimulus, a stronger level of fatigue might be reached, and a longer recovery period might be required before master athletes return to baseline levels (Fell and Williams, 2008). A faster acute recovery is, among other factors, attributed to physiological differences between young and older participants (e.g., phosphocreatine recovery and impaired oxygen supply;Â\\xa0Fell and Williams, 2008). Regarding long-term recovery, the common belief among athletes and coaches is that older athletes experience greater muscle damage and slower repair during and after highly intensive exercise because of minor anabolic stimulus. On the other hand, this aspect is still debated in the literature, since multiple methodological issues have to be addressed, such as gender differences, training status, training protocols, and measurements of the damage (Fell and Williams, 2008).\\nIt must be pointed out that master athletes experienced less pronounced acute internal load and perceptual fatigue (Tables 2Â\\xa0andÂ\\xa03, andÂ\\xa0Figure 2). Similarly, the PPC showed a lower acute post-exercise decrease in the master athletes compared with the young athletes. The higher BLa concentrations in the young athletes can be attributed to the higher number of repetitions during the final all-out set when participants were encouraged to perform until their momentary muscular failure (Table 3). It appears that the master athletes started into the final set more carefully and defensively while anticipating possible injury risks and the upcoming recovery demands. Furthermore, despite a similar leg muscle mass and a comparable level of maximum dynamic strength (Table 1), the samples clearly differed in their power capacities during the vertical jump test (Figure 1). A higher amount of type II fibers in younger athletes and a correspondingly stronger glycolytic activity can be assumed. Type II fibers are usually more susceptible to disruption leading to higher BLa and CK values in young athletes (Baird et al., 2012). Therefore, a final assessment of hypotheses 1 is difficult as internal and external loads were slightly different in both age groups.\\nRegarding the second hypothesis, it was assumed that CWI and CC, especially when used in combination and over a longer period, could improve post-exercise recovery by ameliorating edema, decreasing secondary exercise-induced muscle damage and the sensation of muscle soreness, improving the clearance of muscle metabolites, and increasing post-exercise parasympathetic activity (Ihsan et al., 2016;Â\\xa0Brown et al., 2017). However, on the group level and regardless of age, the current study revealed no effect of MMR on the recovery of performance or muscle contractile markers of fatigue and recovery (rejection of hypothesis 2). Additionally, MMR did not significantly improve the recovery of CK activity, although reductions in muscle soreness and improvements in PPC were evident after MMR. Such a finding is common, likely due to the analgesia and placebo effect attributable to CWI and CC (Leeder et al., 2012;Â\\xa0Poppendieck et al., 2013;Â\\xa0Ihsan et al., 2016;Â\\xa0Brown et al., 2017).\\nRegardless of age, the group-level results of the current study are both consistent and in contrast to the overall literature findings examining CWI or CC as recovery tools, with applied research showing both improved and unchanged or even impaired recovery of fatigue markers following CWI and CC (Leeder et al., 2012;Â\\xa0Poppendieck et al., 2013;Â\\xa0Hill et al., 2014;Â\\xa0Machado et al., 2016;Â\\xa0MarquÃ©s-JimÃ©nez et al., 2016;Â\\xa0Brown et al., 2017). The inconsistent findings within the available studies can be explained by the different CWI and/or CC protocols used as well as the frequently reported extensive interindividual variations even in response to highly standardized training and/or recovery interventions (Pickering and Kiely, 2017;Â\\xa0Wiewelhove et al., 2021). A high interindividual variability in the observed response to recovery interventions is supported by the current study. Only three participants (i.e., participants 2, 8, and 10) did likely benefit from MMR. All other participants showed inconsistent/diffuse responses, while a positive effect of MMR on the recovery of performance tended to be more frequently observed in the younger athletes. The inconsistent responses could be explained by a possible inability of the MMR protocol to accelerate recovery, at least in terms of muscle performance and CK activity, as well as the complexity of the kinematics of exercise-induced fatigue, which may cause different effects within individual body systems. Genetic influences make an important contribution to these variations, while factors, such as sleep, psychological stress, habitual physical activity, and dietary intake, may also play important roles (Mann et al., 2014). Only dietary intake was standardized and controlled during the present study. Additionally, the amount of data was rather small. Thus, the effectiveness of MMR should be interpreted with great caution.\\nIt is also assumed that the effectiveness of a recovery intervention may differ more depending on the individual preferences and beliefs concerning the intervention rather than on age (Roelands and Hurst, 2020). For example, several participants from both age groups (i.e., participants 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 14, and 16) showed a consistent positive response to MMR in subjective markers, but MMR likely only had a consistent positive impact on performance in participant 8, while the performance of participant 14 was likely to have benefited from PR. Conversely, participant 4 showed a positive response to MMR in MVIC force, resting twitch force, CMJ height, and serum concentration of CK, but had a negative response to MMR in both subjective markers. Therefore, the use of recovery methods post-exercise in general and of MMR in particular should be individualized regardless of age. However, considering only individual perceptions may be misleading for the restoration of performance and/or muscle function.\\nFurthermore, it is discussed in the literature whether a long-term application of recovery interventions might attenuate training-specific adaptations in long-term training intervention and how to balance possible deteriorations in training adaptations with the possible beneficial short-term recovery effects. For example,Â\\xa0FrÃ¶hlich et al. (2014),Â\\xa0Roberts et al. (2015), andÂ\\xa0Poppendieck et al. (2020)Â\\xa0showed that the regular use of CWI after strength training sessions reduced long-term gains in muscle mass and strength. However, the effects were rather small and therefore only of practical relevance for a few elite athletes. In this study, MMR had not physiological effects on post-exercise recovery at the group level. Thus, possible negative effects of a long-term application of MMR on adaptations are most likely rather minor and negligible in most athletes.\\nFinally, some limitations of the study design must be considered which are (1) the small number and heterogeneity of selected young and elderly athletes and (2) the insufficient adjustment of internal and external loads. Regarding the sample size, we strictly followed the predefined inclusion criteria for both age groups, which were difficult to meet by the master athletes. More than fifty applicants had to be pre-tested to identify eight individuals reaching a minimum half squat 1RM of at least 120% of the individual body weight which was necessary to match the dynamic strength performance of both age groups and corresponds to an advanced resistance training status in older athletes (Santos Junior et al., 2021). Nevertheless, despite a comparable level of maximum dynamic strength and a similar body composition, the samples clearly differed in their power capacities. Noticeable in this regard were the significantly lower CMJ performance and twitch force (Figure 2) as well as the lower basic testosterone release in the older athletes (Table 1). It can be concluded that a complete performance matching was not realized; however, it was implemented as well as possible at least for the 1RM, which was defined as our primary inclusion criterion.\\nDifferences in the acute internal and external loads of the exercise program can be attributed to the higher number of repetitions during the final set as well as to a higher amount of type II fibers and a correspondingly stronger glycolytic activity in the younger athletes. Nevertheless, since no significant within-subject effect between the two cross-over parts was found for any of the fatigue and recovery markers, it appears that a sufficiently standardized and replicable protocol was prescribed.\\nConclusion\\nAt the group level, master athletes neither reach higher fatigue levels nor recover more slowly than the younger athletes. Age-related differences were only found within younger athletes reaching a higher post-exercise fatigue regarding muscle soreness and PPC. Furthermore, the results indicate that a mixed-method recovery intervention (MMR) after resistance exercise does not contribute to a faster recovery of physical performance, neuromuscular function, or muscle damage, but promotes recovery of perceptual measures regardless of age. However, some participants were more likely to benefit from MMR also in terms of functional and physiological measures. Therefore, the use of MMR should be individualized. As limitations, it has to be pointed out that our sample size was rather small and that a complete matching of population characteristics and exercise intensity was difficult under the ecological valid conditions of this study. Both may have affected the outcomes. We therefore recommend further studies under more controlled experimental conditions.\\n\\nPage 1 of 1\\n\\n\"', 'Comparisons in the Recovery Response From Resistance Exercise Between Young and Middle-Aged Men\\n\\nDiscussion\\nResults of this study indicated no differences in the recovery response between YA and MA for any of the performance measures, nor in subjective levels of muscle pain or soreness. Furthermore, no between-group differences were observed in the inflammatory or\\xa0muscle damage\\xa0response to the exercise protocol. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine differences in the recovery response from high-volume resistance exercise between recreationally trained young and middle-aged adults. Our results comparing BL performance measures seem to be in agreement with other investigations, demonstrating differences in strength measures between young (23\\x9629 years) and older adults (60\\x9665 years) (7,15,24), and between middle-aged (41\\x9642 years) and older adults (70\\x9672 years) (17,18). It does seem that the decline in strength may develop during middle age. However, recovery from exercise seems to be comparable in both younger and middle-aged adults as reflected by similar changes in performance and markers of\\xa0muscle damage\\xa0and\\xa0inflammation. Although changes in strength may occur in middle age, recovery from exercise does seem to be maintained in recreationally trained individuals.\\nThe differences observed at BL in isometric force and the rate of force development is consistent with other investigations comparing younger and older adults (16,19,36). Although differences in age between young and middle-aged adults do seem to affect BL levels of strength, it does not seem to affect recovery from exercise. This is supported by similar patterns of\\xa0muscle damage\\xa0and\\xa0inflammation\\xa0observed during the recovery period after the HVP. Elevations in Mb and CK concentrations are consistent with the expected physiological response from a bout of resistance exercise (9,34). These results also suggest that middle-aged recreationally active men who regularly engage in\\xa0resistance training\\xa0do not seem to be at increased risk for greater soreness or\\xa0muscle damage\\xa0in comparison with younger recreationally trained men.\\nSimilar response patterns were also noted in the inflammatory response for both groups. No significant elevations from BL were observed in CRP. However, significant increases in IL-6 concentrations were observed for both groups. Although CRP is an acute phase protein whose function is to activate the innate immune response and enhance phagocytosis (10), it does not seem to change after an acute bout of resistance exercise (6). Previous research has reported no significant changes in CRP concentrations after\\xa0resistance training\\xa0protocols recruiting primarily both upper-body (31) and lower-body exercises (4) in younger men. Furthermore, previous investigations have also indicated that training experience can reduce the CRP response to an acute bout of exercise (22,35). Considering that participants in both YA and MA were recreationally trained, it is likely that this training experience may have attenuated the CRP response. Physiologically, it is consistent with the lower stress and damage that occurs with repetitive training (9,35). Interleukin-6 is an inflammatory cytokine that facilitates communication for the mobilization, proliferation, and differentiation of immune cells to the site of tissue damage (6) and has been shown to increase after exercise (11). Elevations in IL-6 are related to the intensity, duration, and mode of training (11,13,32), but the literature is inconclusive regarding the IL-6 response to\\xa0resistance training. A recent study reported that a bout of high-volume resistance exercise (8 sets of 10 repetitions with 70% of maximal strength in the squat exercise) resulted in a significant elevation in IL-6 concentrations 30 min after exercise, but no changes were observed after a bout of high-intensity resistance exercise (8 sets of 3 repetitions with 90% of maximal strength in the squat exercise) in experienced, trained lifters (4). The IL-6 response observed during this investigation as a result of a bout of high-volume resistance exercise seems to be consistent with that recently reported by Bartolomei et al. (4). However, age did not seem to exacerbate nor attenuate the IL-6 response in recreationally trained participants.\\nNo differences were noted in the inflammatory or\\xa0muscle damage\\xa0response between YA and MA. As discussed earlier, this is likely related to the recreational training background of the participants. However, there were several limitations to the study that need to be acknowledged. The exercise protocol was performed on an isokinetic dynamometer, which may not have as much practical application as most\\xa0resistance training\\xa0programs use dynamic constant resistance exercises. In addition, unilateral, single-joint exercise recruited a relatively smaller muscle mass than is commonly used in most training programs. The use of this modality of exercise, which has been demonstrated to be very effective in eliciting\\xa0muscle damage\\xa0(20,30), may not have been sufficient to elicit significant performance and inflammatory changes in these recreationally trained participants. Future research should examine modes of training specific to the typical training program of the participants.\\nPractical Applications\\nThe results of this study indicate that changes in muscle performance seem to begin during middle age, even in recreationally trained individuals. However, participating in recreational\\xa0resistance training\\xa0may mitigate any alteration in the recovery response from exercise. These results should be examined in the context that recovery was investigated after a unilateral, single-joint isokinetic exercise protocol. Although this method has been previously used as an effective mode of exercise to elicit\\xa0muscle damage, it is not specific to the type of exercises typically used by recreational lifters. Future studies may wish to compare these population groups using multijoint, dynamic constant resistance exercises common to the training programs of most recreational lifters, regardless of age.', 'Effect of different doses of supervised exercise on food intake, metabolism, and non-exercise physical activity: The E-MECHANIC randomized controlled trial.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nIn this large randomized controlled trial with 2 doses of exercise, energy intake assessed with DLW increased significantly and as hypothesized in the 20 KKW group, as well as in the 8 KKW group, which was unexpected. The hypotheses were based on previous research demonstrating that compensation most frequently occurs at higher doses of exercise (4), although the results of this study indicate that compensation also occurs at lower doses of exercise. This discrepancy may be due to differences in the study samples since the current study recruited men and women aged 18\\x9665 y, whereas the Church et al. (4) study recruited postmenopausal women. Change in energy intake measured with the less sensitive test meals did not differ among the groups, which also was unexpected. Significant weight compensation was detected in the 8 and 20 KKW groups. Compensation in the 8 KKW group was not predicted, although it was predicted that compensation would be significantly higher in the 20 KKW group compared with the 8 KKW group, as observed.\\nAlthough most participants in the 8 KKW (76.3%) and 20 KKW (90.2%) groups compensated, there was great heterogeneity in weight loss and compensation with both exercise doses. Large individual variability in weight loss in response to exercise has been observed in other studies, including a 12-wk single-dose exercise study with 35 participants (7). Almost half (42.4%) and 23.5% of participants in the 8 and 20 KKW groups, respectively, did not lose any weight or gained weight. These percentages are much higher than the 13% of participants who did the same in the 12-wk exercise study by King et al. (7), thus suggesting that longer durations of exercise increase compensatory responses. This conclusion is further supported by Church et al. (4), who found that compensation, assessed on a weekly basis, did not occur until approximately week 12. Very few participants in the exercise groups lost more weight than expected. Participants in the 8 and 20 KKW groups lost only 36.2% and 40.8% of predicted weight loss, respectively, which is similar to previous studies (34), including ours, although previously we had not always found compensation at lower exercise doses (4,\\xa05). Body fat loss was greater in the 20 KKW group compared to control, and change in lean mass did not differ among groups. Compensation appears to be a response to long-term exercise training because short-term studies (e.g., 13 wk) show smaller compensation only at higher doses (35) and acute studies (e.g., 2 d) show no compensation (36). Weight change in the control group was minimal (?0.2 kg), and participants in all groups were not instructed to change their diet.\\nTo our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to prospectively attempt to identify the mechanisms of compensation by assessing changes in energy intake, metabolism, and self-report measures of appetite and other constructs. The study found that compensation appears to be primarily the result of increased energy intake and not changes in metabolism/energy expenditure, RQ, or non-exercise physical activity. Energy intake by DLW increased by 90.7 and 123.6 kcal/d (3.9% and 5.5%) in the 8 and 20 KKW groups, respectively. Increases of this magnitude are difficult to detect over the short term, and energy intake is known to vary widely from day to day (37,\\xa038), indicating that long-term measures of energy intake are optimal. This may have contributed to the failure to detect increased energy intake with test meals and is consistent with the results of King et al. (7), who found that energy intake measured with test meals did not increase among the entire sample of exercisers (energy intake and hunger did increase among compensators in their study, however). Another interpretation is that increased energy intake likely occurs outside of meals (e.g., from snacking or drinking calorie-containing beverages between meals). Finally, it can be difficult for people to detect changes in daily energy intake of this size (?100 kcal), which could contribute to unawareness of compensation and hence the inability to address it.\\nChanges in RQ, RMR, and non-exercise physical activity were similar by group, the latter of which is consistent with results from other studies (39,\\xa040). A review concluded that exercise does not result in decreased non-exercise activity or energy expenditure (41). At the exercise doses achieved in this study, people do not appear to become more sedentary outside of structured exercise after they begin to exercise, although it is possible that activities of daily living limit the ability to detect such an effect.\\nMore participants in the exercise groups classified as compensators met the criteria for metabolic syndrome compared with noncompensators (31% compared with 11%, respectively), suggesting that the compensatory increase in energy intake might be related to the predisposition to diabetes and insulin insensitivity. Also, compensators had a smaller response to exercise in terms of improved cardiorespiratory fitness compared with noncompensators, but they had larger reductions in glucose levels, although the difference was small (2.5 mg/dL). Compensators had an increase in adjusted RMR, indicating that their bodies were expending more energy relative to body mass after exercise training, which could be a physiological response to increased energy intake, or they had longer lasting excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (42). Increased RMR, adjusted using the methods described by Galgani and Santos (17), was also observed in the compensators compared with the noncompensators. Nonetheless, the Galgani values were also higher at baseline in the compensators than in the noncompensators (Supplemental Table 5), whereas baseline RMR did not differ by compensator status when adjusted only for fat-free mass (data not shown). Thus, compensators could have higher relative RMR regardless of exercise levels, and adjustments to RMR beyond fat-free mass are needed to detect such differences.\\nSupporting the conclusion that compensation is due to increased energy intake, compensators had an ?90 kcal/d larger increase in energy intake and increased cravings for sweets, hunger, prospective food consumption, and compensatory health beliefs (and a smaller reduction in disinhibition). The results suggest that compensators might\\xa01) differ in important ways prior to exercise that contribute to a differential response,\\xa02) not experience some physiological (e.g., increased cardiorespiratory fitness) benefits of exercise that lead to exercise being more difficult/aversive,\\xa03) have different psychological responses to exercise (e.g., increased compensatory beliefs and smaller reductions in disinhibition) that affect other health behaviors, and\\xa04) experience an increased drive to eat. Furthermore, the results indicate that compensators, who one could argue are most in need of exercise based on the higher prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, are most likely to fail to fully realize the benefits of exercise and possibly discontinue exercise due to the perceived lack of benefit or aversive aspects of exercise.\\nThe results suggest that clinicians should include a concomitant lifestyle, dietary, or possibly pharmacological intervention when prescribing exercise if weight loss is the goal. Further research is needed to determine what interventions are most effective at reducing compensation and improving the beneficial response to exercise, and many of the constructs that were different between compensators and noncompensators (e.g., change in disinhibition and cravings) can be targeted by various interventions.\\nStudy strengths include being the first prospective randomized controlled trial powered to identify the mechanisms by which exercise fails to produce the expected level of weight loss. Also, energy intake, energy expenditure, and activity were measured with gold standard techniques, and questionnaires assessed constructs associated with health behaviors and health-related quality of life. Finally, exercise adherence was excellent, and the dose of exercise achieved was carefully quantified. Weaknesses include lack of data regarding what foods participants ate and when, as well as the fact that the majority of the sample was composed of women, although the randomization procedures considered sex.\\nIn conclusion, in this 6-mo randomized controlled exercise trial, participants in the exercise groups compensated and lost less weight than expected. Compensation was found to primarily be the result of increased energy intake and not changes in metabolism/energy expenditure or non-exercise physical activity. Participants who compensated were more likely to meet criteria for metabolic syndrome, responded differently to exercise, and reported increased appetite and compensatory health beliefs. These findings provide insight into how to reduce compensation during long-term exercise.', 'Habitual tub bathing and risks of incident coronary heart disease and stroke\\n\\nDiscussion In the present long-term cohort study of middle-aged Japanese men and women, we observed an inverse association between tub bathing frequency and risks of CVD, CHD, total strokes and intracerebral haemorrhage. Tub bathing was not associated with a higher risk of sudden cardiac death. This is the first study to examine the long-term associations between tub bathing and CVD incidence using a large population-based cohort. Laukkanen\\x92s study of 2315 men aged 42\\x9660 years in Finland with 6-year follow-up investigated the association of sauna bathing frequency with risks of fatal CVD, fatal CHD and sudden cardiac death. In that study, the multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% CIs) for sauna bathing four to seven times/week compared with one time/week were 0.50 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.77) for fatal CVD, 0.52 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.88) for fatal CHD and 0.37 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.75) for sudden cardiac death.6 However, that study did not examine the effect of sauna on the risk of non-fatal CVD. A variety of studies have addressed the mechanisms by which heat exposure plays a role in preventing CVD.20 Heat exposure increases core body temperature, cardiac contractility, heart rate and blood flow, and decreases vessel endothelial shear stress.4 21 These effects are similar to the impact of exercise and are believed to improve vascular function over the long term.22 23 Preliminary research found that heat exposure induced expression of heat shock protein 90, and when it was bound to endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), eNOS, in turn, generated nitric oxide, resulting in vasorelaxation.24 There are, however, physiological differences between tub and sauna bathing; the former increases hydrostatic pressure, which in turn increases intracardiac pressure, while both tub and sauna bathing increase stroke volume, cardiac output, ejection fraction and reduce vascular resistance.25 The potential beneficial effect of tub bathing of CVD events may be mediated by the reduced development of major cardio\\x02vascular risk factors in those who took tub bath frequently. We found that the frequent tub bathing was significantly associated with a lower risk of hypertension, suggesting that a beneficial effect of tub bathing on risk of CVD may be in part due to a reduced risk of developing hypertension. The typical Japanese style of bathing involves filling the tub to shoulder depth with hot water at approximately 40°C\\x9642°C,9 while some prefer temperatures upward of 43°C.26 In two previous controlled trials, one investigated the effects of hot bathing on blood pressure, flow-mediated vascular dilation, arterial compliance and aortic pulse waves among 20 young sedentary adults,4 and the other examined effects on body weight and abdominal circumference among 66 overweight adults.5 Both studies evidenced the favourable effects of tub bathing when using water up to 42°C. The negative aspect of tub bathing is that it can cause heatstroke more frequently when the tub water temperature is too high.27 In our research, we asked participants to subjectively describe their tub water temperature (lukewarm, warm or hot). However, we observed no significant difference in the inverse association between tub bathing frequency and risk of CVD by the water temperature. Our results did not suggest any preferable water temperature, but further research regarding the water temperature is warranted. We were able to conduct this observational study in a unique culture in which tub bathing is a common habit. The strength of our study included its prospective design, systemic registration of CHD and stroke incidence, use of a large sample from the general population, and a long follow-up duration. The large sample size and long-term follow-up allowed us to perform analysis after excluding participants with early cardiovascular events, and this reduced the possibility of reverse causation. Nonetheless, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, the information on the tub bathing frequency was obtained only at baseline. Therefore, participants may have changed their frequency during the follow-up period. Second, because those who frequently bathe in a tub were found likely to have higher education and to be office workers, tub bathing frequency may be a behavioural marker for higher socioeconomic conditions. However, the inverse association between tub bathing and risk of CVD outcomes remained statistically significant after adjusting for these socioeconomic variables. Third, we also did not inquire about reasons for bathing in a tub less frequently. For some, this may be due to illness or conditions by which risk of CVD could be elevated. However, the possibility for reverse causation is unlikely, although not totally negated, because the association between tub bathing frequency and risk of total CVD did not change materially after excluding participants who developed CVD or died within 5 or 10 years of baseline. Finally, though we adjusted for potential confounding variables based on previous research, we cannot negate the possibility of residual or unmeasured confounding. Conclusion We found that habitual tub bathing was associated with a lower risk of CVD among middle-aged Japanese, suggesting a beneficial effect on the prevention of CVD.', 'Impact of insufficient sleep on dysregulated blood glucose control under standardised meal conditions\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\nHere, we describe for the first time how sleep duration, quality and midpoint associate with postprandial glucose metabolism in healthy individuals. While sleep is generally recognised as one of the pillars of good health, the data reported here suggest that one-size-fits-all sleep recommendations are suboptimal, particularly in the context of postprandial glycaemic control, a key component of diabetes prevention.\\n\\nBy analysing both between-person and within-person effects, this study provides unique and powerful insights into both population-level and person-level effects of sleep on metabolic health. Notably, our data suggest that sleep duration, efficiency and midpoint are important determinants of postprandial glycaemic control at a population level, while illustrating that to optimise sleep recommendations it is likely necessary to tailor these to the individual.\\n\\nDiet, sleep and health are interrelated. Several studies have investigated the relationship between sleep duration and glucose metabolism in pregnant women and reported a positive association between reduced sleep duration and impaired glucose metabolism [4, 27]. However, we are not aware of any other studies to date that investigate the relationship between objectively assessed sleep characteristics and postprandial glucose metabolism in generally healthy adults. The findings from this intervention study, with repeated test meal challenges, combined with objective assessments of sleep and blood glucose from a large population, complement a relatively small body of knowledge around a topic that is likely to be of high relevance for diabetes prevention [26]. Importantly, many earlier studies were undertaken in sleep laboratories with small sample size [11]. While the controlled environment of such studies is necessary to understand specific aspects of sleep and metabolism, the real-world, community-dwelling setting of the current study provides novel insights into how habitual sleep affects metabolic health.\\n\\nThe main analyses in this study focused on interactions of sleep and meal type and selected the OGTT as the \\x91breakfast\\x92 against which all other breakfast meals were compared. This is primarily because the OGTT is the standard clinical test used to assess glucose tolerance. While this is not a realistic breakfast meal, there is a growing trend, particularly among younger people [28], to consume energy drinks as a pick-me-up the morning after a poor night\\x92s sleep, with the sugar content of a 75 g OGTT equating to roughly two to three servings of standard energy drinks.\\n\\nSPT\\nWith SPT being a marker of sleep duration, the lack of a significant marginal effect in the model without interactions indicates that sleep duration is not a major determinant of glucose metabolism. While this finding does not support some prior studies that have demonstrated a potential link between decreased sleep duration and insulin resistance, it is consistent with findings from a randomised controlled trial of 42 normal-weight adult short sleepers [11]. This may be because the effect of sleep duration in glycaemic control may be non-linear, with sleep affecting glucose metabolism only once sleep duration dips below a specific bound [11]. Moreover, sleep duration for the vast majority of PREDICT1 participants fell within the recommended range, as indicated by the mean 6.87 h of sleep within the lowest quartile of the SPT distribution (Table 1). Accordingly, this study may have been underpowered to detect an association between sleep duration and postprandial glycaemic control.\\n\\nWe found a significant statistical interaction between SPT and meal type, with high-carbohydrate meals and high-fat meals resulting in significantly lower glucose iAUCs compared with the OGTT reference, which contained only sugar. Although this study did not include pregnant women, the interaction effect between carbohydrate-rich meals and SPT is consistent with the results reported in a prior study in which reduced sleep was associated with impaired carbohydrate metabolism in pregnant women [29]. Thus, we conclude that the SPT has a similar impact on postprandial carbohydrate metabolism in men and pregnant and non-pregnant women. Additionally, the significant interaction between SPT and high-fat meals is supported by the finding that sleep disruption in fat-fed mice negatively affected glucose metabolism, with metabolism improving after recovery sleep [30]. As for the within-person SPT model, our findings suggest that both a longer SPT in general, as well as having a longer SPT than one is used to, are associated with improved postprandial glycaemic control the following morning. The presence of a significant finding with the SPT?×?high-carbohydrate meal interaction term in the person-centred model suggests that getting more sleep than usual might be more important for postprandial glycaemic control than the absolute amount of sleep achieved. This insight offers a potential avenue for personalised (within-person) sleep interventions.\\n\\nSE\\nBetter SE, between-person as well as within-person, was significantly associated with lower glucose iAUC, meaning that better SE, which is a proxy of sleep quality, was associated with better glucose management following breakfast. However, the absence of SE?×?meal interactions suggests that SE may be beneficial for postprandial glucose response irrespective of meal composition. Although there is not much research on SE and glucose metabolism in healthy adults, our findings concur with a recent meta-analysis in which poor sleep quality was associated with poor glycaemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes [12]. Moreover, since SE can be viewed as a proxy for sleep quality, and because we found a significant association between SE and glucose regulation, but not between SPT and glucose regulation, our findings suggest that sleep quality is more important than sleep duration with respect to glycaemic control. However, sleep apnoea is known to affect SE, and sleep apnoea was not measured in the PREDICT1 study.\\n\\nSleep midpoint\\nThe presence of significant effects in both between-person and within-person sleep midpoint models adjusted for sleep duration suggests a novel finding that later sleep midpoint, such as that caused by going to bed later, is associated with impaired postprandial glucose response to breakfast the following morning. This concurs with the proposition that human metabolic health is determined to a considerable extent by chronobiology [31]. Alternatively, later sleep midpoint may reflect alteration of sleep stages caused by going to bed later. Thus, the significance of later sleep midpoint may also be indicative of the role of specific sleep stages, such as slow-wave sleep, on glucose metabolism, supporting the view that treating slow-wave sleep disorders may help improve glycaemic control [32].\\n\\nThe 2 h glucose iAUC response to an OGTT breakfast is roughly twice that following a high-fat breakfast, indicating that a high-fat breakfast might help to mitigate the detrimental effects of poor sleep on postprandial glycaemia. Although comparing areas may have its drawbacks, for those whose sleep is often compromised, these effects may be cumulative. Thus, over time, there may be a meaningful clinical impact on glycaemic health. Nevertheless, because of the short duration of the current study, we are not able to assess this hypothesis.\\n\\nMuch of the research linking poor sleep with altered glucose metabolism is based upon observational studies, meaning that the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the associations reported here are not well understood [33]. However, poor sleep quality (measured by sleep fragmentation in healthy volunteers) appears to alter glucose responses through shifting sympathovagal balance and morning cortisol levels, which could in turn lead to decreased insulin sensitivity, increased hepatic glucogenesis and decreased insulin secretion [33]. In addition to cortisol levels, growth hormone, the secretion of which is sleep-dependent and which is essential for metabolic regulation, could also be at play [34,35,36]. Moreover, the glucose intolerance observed elsewhere in sleep-deprived individuals may derive from dysregulation of sympathetic and parasympathetic control of pancreatic function [37].\\n\\nStrengths and limitations\\nThis study significantly extends our understanding of the interplay between sleep and metabolic health. First, the fairly limited literature on sleep and postprandial blood glucose regulation is dominated by small studies that focus on populations with comorbid conditions (e.g. diabetes and obstructive sleep apnoea). In the few larger published studies, sleep has typically been assessed through self-report, which may be prone to bias. Moreover, most studies are cross-sectional and based in highly controlled environments. By contrast, our study is set within a large prospective cohort of generally healthy individuals, in whom high-resolution objectively assessed time-series sleep and glucose data were obtained. These design features made it possible to look at both intra- and inter-individual variation during the analyses, have generalisable results and shed light on cause and effect. The risk of non-compliance due to a non-clinical setting was addressed by high levels of staff support and all data points were checked for compliance and validity. We also examined the effects of within-person sleep measures, thus broadening the scope of previous studies that up to now only included between-person differences. In addition, instead of relying on fasting blood assays, the study focused on postprandial glucose, which is more relevant to everyday life scenarios because most people find themselves most often in a postprandial state during waking hours [26].\\n\\nNotwithstanding the strengths of the study, it is limited in that no screening was performed for sleep disorders (e.g. sleep apnoea and insomnia), meaning that we could not control for disorders that have been shown to be associated with impaired glucose tolerance [38, 39]. In addition, while actigraphy overcomes many limitations of self-report measures, it is not as accurate as polysomnography in estimating sleep duration and efficiency and does not offer insight into individual sleep stages. The distribution of meal types was imbalanced, with high-fat and high-carbohydrate standardised meals having the highest number of entries. Thus, it is possible that analyses focused on the non-high-carbohydrate and non-high-fat meals may have lacked statistical power. An additional limitation is that owing to the free-living nature of the trial, physical activity levels varied within and between individuals, which may have interacted with sleep and meal type to affect blood glucose concentrations, a hypothesis that our study was not powered to examine.\\n\\nFuture studies assessing the impact of sleep stages on postprandial blood glucose levels are likely to extend the findings of the current analysis, as would exploration of these effects in individuals who are sleep-deprived owing to shift work or endogenous sleep disorders such as sleep apnoea.\\n\\nConclusion\\nOverall, this study suggests that sleep duration, quality and midpoint are important modifiable lifestyle features for improving postprandial glucose metabolism in healthy adults. As a consequence, this study\\x92s findings may inform lifestyle strategies to improve postprandial blood glucose levels, focusing on earlier bedtime routines and maximising high-quality uninterrupted sleep. A combination of both generalised and more personalised sleep guidelines is likely required to ensure optimal metabolic health per se and maximise the effectiveness of guidelines for diabetes prevention.\\nPage 1 of 1', 'Recovery From Eccentric Squat Exercise in Resistance-Trained Young and Master Athletes With Similar Maximum Strength: Combining Cold Water Immersion and Compression\\n\\nDiscussion\\nThe study aimed at investigating the effects of aging on muscle soreness and muscle damage following an intensive squat exercise protocol as well as on age-related effects of a recovery intervention in tightly controlled populations of young and master athletes regarding their absolute performance level. As an important experimental precondition, all markers of fatigue and recovery showed a significant within-subject effect of time of measurement with strikingly more pronounced changes from pre- to post-exercise (Figure 2), while CK peaked at post-24 in most individuals. Usually, the highest CK activity is found at 24 or 48h post-exercise. A mean CK increase of up to two times the baseline and up to 800U/l in some individuals can be attributed to structural damage to muscle cells (Baird et al., 2012). Therefore, it can be concluded that the applied high-intensive and eccentric overloaded exercise protocol was acutely sufficiently fatiguing and well-chosen to produce ongoing muscle soreness and muscle damage, which confirms the findings from other studies (Proske and Allen, 2005;\\xa0Lavender and Nosaka, 2006;\\xa0Raeder et al., 2016a;\\xa0Bridgeman et al., 2017;\\xa0Thomas et al., 2018).\\nRegarding the first hypothesis, the master athletes neither reach higher fatigue levels nor recover more slowly than the younger athletes (rejection of hypothesis 1). These findings partly contradict the current literature suggesting that, for a similar exercise stimulus, a stronger level of fatigue might be reached, and a longer recovery period might be required before master athletes return to baseline levels (Fell and Williams, 2008). A faster acute recovery is, among other factors, attributed to physiological differences between young and older participants (e.g., phosphocreatine recovery and impaired oxygen supply;\\xa0Fell and Williams, 2008). Regarding long-term recovery, the common belief among athletes and coaches is that older athletes experience greater muscle damage and slower repair during and after highly intensive exercise because of minor anabolic stimulus. On the other hand, this aspect is still debated in the literature, since multiple methodological issues have to be addressed, such as gender differences, training status, training protocols, and measurements of the damage (Fell and Williams, 2008).\\nIt must be pointed out that master athletes experienced less pronounced acute internal load and perceptual fatigue (Tables 2\\xa0and\\xa03, and\\xa0Figure 2). Similarly, the PPC showed a lower acute post-exercise decrease in the master athletes compared with the young athletes. The higher BLa concentrations in the young athletes can be attributed to the higher number of repetitions during the final all-out set when participants were encouraged to perform until their momentary muscular failure (Table 3). It appears that the master athletes started into the final set more carefully and defensively while anticipating possible injury risks and the upcoming recovery demands. Furthermore, despite a similar leg muscle mass and a comparable level of maximum dynamic strength (Table 1), the samples clearly differed in their power capacities during the vertical jump test (Figure 1). A higher amount of type II fibers in younger athletes and a correspondingly stronger glycolytic activity can be assumed. Type II fibers are usually more susceptible to disruption leading to higher BLa and CK values in young athletes (Baird et al., 2012). Therefore, a final assessment of hypotheses 1 is difficult as internal and external loads were slightly different in both age groups.\\nRegarding the second hypothesis, it was assumed that CWI and CC, especially when used in combination and over a longer period, could improve post-exercise recovery by ameliorating edema, decreasing secondary exercise-induced muscle damage and the sensation of muscle soreness, improving the clearance of muscle metabolites, and increasing post-exercise parasympathetic activity (Ihsan et al., 2016;\\xa0Brown et al., 2017). However, on the group level and regardless of age, the current study revealed no effect of MMR on the recovery of performance or muscle contractile markers of fatigue and recovery (rejection of hypothesis 2). Additionally, MMR did not significantly improve the recovery of CK activity, although reductions in muscle soreness and improvements in PPC were evident after MMR. Such a finding is common, likely due to the analgesia and placebo effect attributable to CWI and CC (Leeder et al., 2012;\\xa0Poppendieck et al., 2013;\\xa0Ihsan et al., 2016;\\xa0Brown et al., 2017).\\nRegardless of age, the group-level results of the current study are both consistent and in contrast to the overall literature findings examining CWI or CC as recovery tools, with applied research showing both improved and unchanged or even impaired recovery of fatigue markers following CWI and CC (Leeder et al., 2012;\\xa0Poppendieck et al., 2013;\\xa0Hill et al., 2014;\\xa0Machado et al., 2016;\\xa0Marqués-Jiménez et al., 2016;\\xa0Brown et al., 2017). The inconsistent findings within the available studies can be explained by the different CWI and/or CC protocols used as well as the frequently reported extensive interindividual variations even in response to highly standardized training and/or recovery interventions (Pickering and Kiely, 2017;\\xa0Wiewelhove et al., 2021). A high interindividual variability in the observed response to recovery interventions is supported by the current study. Only three participants (i.e., participants 2, 8, and 10) did likely benefit from MMR. All other participants showed inconsistent/diffuse responses, while a positive effect of MMR on the recovery of performance tended to be more frequently observed in the younger athletes. The inconsistent responses could be explained by a possible inability of the MMR protocol to accelerate recovery, at least in terms of muscle performance and CK activity, as well as the complexity of the kinematics of exercise-induced fatigue, which may cause different effects within individual body systems. Genetic influences make an important contribution to these variations, while factors, such as sleep, psychological stress, habitual physical activity, and dietary intake, may also play important roles (Mann et al., 2014). Only dietary intake was standardized and controlled during the present study. Additionally, the amount of data was rather small. Thus, the effectiveness of MMR should be interpreted with great caution.\\nIt is also assumed that the effectiveness of a recovery intervention may differ more depending on the individual preferences and beliefs concerning the intervention rather than on age (Roelands and Hurst, 2020). For example, several participants from both age groups (i.e., participants 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 14, and 16) showed a consistent positive response to MMR in subjective markers, but MMR likely only had a consistent positive impact on performance in participant 8, while the performance of participant 14 was likely to have benefited from PR. Conversely, participant 4 showed a positive response to MMR in MVIC force, resting twitch force, CMJ height, and serum concentration of CK, but had a negative response to MMR in both subjective markers. Therefore, the use of recovery methods post-exercise in general and of MMR in particular should be individualized regardless of age. However, considering only individual perceptions may be misleading for the restoration of performance and/or muscle function.\\nFurthermore, it is discussed in the literature whether a long-term application of recovery interventions might attenuate training-specific adaptations in long-term training intervention and how to balance possible deteriorations in training adaptations with the possible beneficial short-term recovery effects. For example,\\xa0Fröhlich et al. (2014),\\xa0Roberts et al. (2015), and\\xa0Poppendieck et al. (2020)\\xa0showed that the regular use of CWI after strength training sessions reduced long-term gains in muscle mass and strength. However, the effects were rather small and therefore only of practical relevance for a few elite athletes. In this study, MMR had not physiological effects on post-exercise recovery at the group level. Thus, possible negative effects of a long-term application of MMR on adaptations are most likely rather minor and negligible in most athletes.\\nFinally, some limitations of the study design must be considered which are (1) the small number and heterogeneity of selected young and elderly athletes and (2) the insufficient adjustment of internal and external loads. Regarding the sample size, we strictly followed the predefined inclusion criteria for both age groups, which were difficult to meet by the master athletes. More than fifty applicants had to be pre-tested to identify eight individuals reaching a minimum half squat 1RM of at least 120% of the individual body weight which was necessary to match the dynamic strength performance of both age groups and corresponds to an advanced resistance training status in older athletes (Santos Junior et al., 2021). Nevertheless, despite a comparable level of maximum dynamic strength and a similar body composition, the samples clearly differed in their power capacities. Noticeable in this regard were the significantly lower CMJ performance and twitch force (Figure 2) as well as the lower basic testosterone release in the older athletes (Table 1). It can be concluded that a complete performance matching was not realized; however, it was implemented as well as possible at least for the 1RM, which was defined as our primary inclusion criterion.\\nDifferences in the acute internal and external loads of the exercise program can be attributed to the higher number of repetitions during the final set as well as to a higher amount of type II fibers and a correspondingly stronger glycolytic activity in the younger athletes. Nevertheless, since no significant within-subject effect between the two cross-over parts was found for any of the fatigue and recovery markers, it appears that a sufficiently standardized and replicable protocol was prescribed.\\nConclusion\\nAt the group level, master athletes neither reach higher fatigue levels nor recover more slowly than the younger athletes. Age-related differences were only found within younger athletes reaching a higher post-exercise fatigue regarding muscle soreness and PPC. Furthermore, the results indicate that a mixed-method recovery intervention (MMR) after resistance exercise does not contribute to a faster recovery of physical performance, neuromuscular function, or muscle damage, but promotes recovery of perceptual measures regardless of age. However, some participants were more likely to benefit from MMR also in terms of functional and physiological measures. Therefore, the use of MMR should be individualized. As limitations, it has to be pointed out that our sample size was rather small and that a complete matching of population characteristics and exercise intensity was difficult under the ecological valid conditions of this study. Both may have affected the outcomes. We therefore recommend further studies under more controlled experimental conditions.\\n\\nPage 1 of 1', 'The Impact of Sleep Duration on Performance Among Competitive Athletes: A Systematic Literature Review  \\n\\nDISCUSSION \\nThis literature review, although diverse in the range of sports, methods, and outcomes studied, provides several stylized facts that can inform sleep research and competitive athletes. First, out of all the published studies we reviewed, none found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome. All of the results reviewed showed that either the increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance or the results were neutral. Note that among studies reporting significant positive results, effect sizes varied considerably (Tables 2-4), likely due to differences in the duration of sleep deprivation/extension experienced as well as differences in outcome measures. Second, when considering the aerobic and anaerobic characteristics of sports, it seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity, including strength testing. For instance, Mejri et al40 found that depriving competitive taekwondo boxers of a mere 3 to 4 hours of sleep significantly impaired performance on the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test. By contrast, Blumert et al33 employed a relatively severe sleep deprivation protocol by depriving 9 national-caliber collegiate weightlifters of 24 hours of sleep and yet failed to identify adverse effects on any of the various weightlifting exercises examined. Relatedly, for both endurance and explosive, power-based exercises, it has been well documented that sleep deprivation is associated with increased perceived effort.56\\x9658 Still, the relationship between perceived effort and objective performance has not been widely validated and is a topic for future investigation. Third, of the studies that measured outcomes requiring either tactical and/or technical skills, most find benefits of sleep on performance. Tennis serving accuracy and basketball shooting were both improved by long-term sleep extension interventions,35,39 and tennis serving accuracy suffered when players were deprived of 2 to 2.5 hours of sleep at the beginning of the preceding night.37 Regarding studies conducted in players of team sports that incorporated tactics and decision-based outcomes to a broader extent, soccer as well as rugby players exhibited performance deficits after nights of decreased sleep duration.34 These results are in line with other literature demonstrating clear neurocognitive deficits in the setting of inadequate sleep in the general population, reviewed thoroughly elsewhere.59,60 Finally, when looking at the methodologies of the experimental studies, we found that the studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Interestingly although most acute sleep interventions involved sleep deprivation and yielded positive results, there were inconsistent results among the 2 acute sleep extension studies.15,38 Conversely, the majority of longer-term sleep intervention studies involved sleep extension and showed positive results.35,39,49 Taken together, these findings suggest that on a short timescale, sleep deprivation may be more harmful than sleep extension is beneficial to performance, although in the longer term, sleep extension may contribute to improved performance. On the other hand, more research is warranted regarding potential adverse effects of chronic sleep loss on athletic performance. The reliability and precision of the various measurements may present challenges in interpretation of these studies. For example, \\x93maximal\\x94 voluntary muscle contraction and voluntarily chosen training load are variable across subjects.61,62 On the other hand, \\x93running economy,\\x94 the oxygen cost associated with a given running velocity, has low variability among highly trained runners and is significantly correlated with cardiorespiratory parameters used to assess aerobic capacity.63 A meta-analysis of the reliability of various measures of muscle power previously identified that field running tests tended to be more reliable than treadmill running tests, tests lasting up to 1 minute tended to be more reliable than those lasting greater than 1 minute (likely due to increased variability in muscle movement and limb positioning), and isokinetic tests tended to be more reliable when measuring muscle extension versus flexion.62 Somewhat reassuringly in the context of the present review, this metaanalysis also found that measurements taken from athletes were more reliable than those taken from non-athlete subjects. With respect to the validity of outcome measures reported as performance indicators, the nature of the sport (eg, team vs individual) may be an important determinant of whether what is measured in the laboratory translates to the actual game. For instance, for team-based sports requiring complex game structure such as soccer, measures of muscle force production or running speed are likely insufficient to provide an accurate assessment of in-game performance, although they may be helpful in making gross approximations and predictions.64 Of course, actual performance metrics from real or simulated games would be the ideal outcomes to quantify for such sports in future investigations. More specifically, for performance outcomes included in the current review, the following have been independently validated and shown to be reliable measures of athletic performance: Yo-Yo intermittent recovery (YYIR) test, isometric muscle contraction, squat, countermovement jump, free sthrow basketball shooting, tennis serving, shuttle-running tests, and Wingate test.42\\x9648 In Table 1, we have indicated studies employing previously validated and reliable metrics of objective performance with asterisks (as per the criteria discussed above). Still, more work will be required to further validate the various performance outcomes measured in the studies reviewed in the present work, especially those involving complex, team-based measures such as composite game performance scores and passing accuracy. Likewise, given the high inter-individual variability of sleep variables used across the included studies, these metrics will also require further investigation to determine their precision and reliability as predictors of athletic performance. Importantly, we chose to require at least one objective performance measure among our inclusion criteria. The previous work relying on self-perceived performance, although informative in understanding the potential effect of sleep loss or gain on sports psychology,15 may not accurately reflect actual performance, as was the goal of the present work. However, under certain circumstances, self-perceived pre-game wellness (including self-reported sleep quality) may be predictive of objective in-game performance.65 More research will be needed to assess the validity of player reported performance and objective performance, especially when athletes exhibit compromised sleep. Several experimental studies are particularly illustrative of the various trends in the results we have just outlined. To address the question of whether one night of sleep extension would be sufficient to improve various fitness indices among semi-professional soccer players, Fullagar et al15 tested a sleep hygiene intervention. The investigators implemented a sleep hygiene strategy (SHS) designed to maximize sleep duration and limit stimulation before bedtime to test whether this would be sufficient to improve either anaerobic (jumping height and force production) or aerobic endurance (Yo\\x96Yo intermittent recovery level 2, YYIR2) performance after late night soccer matches. Implementing a randomized design, they assigned 20 participants to follow either their normal post-match sleep routine [non-SHS (NSHS)] or a SHS involving early dimming of lights and lights out by midnight, cool room temperature, and no technology or light stimulation for 15 to 30 minutes before bedtime. Actigraphy was used to measure sleep patterns, and sleep diary was used for subjective recall of sleep quality. Despite finding that those assigned to the SHS indeed exhibited increased sleep duration after the night match relative to those in the NSHS group, the investigators failed to identify any improvements in\\ncountermovement jump height, countermovement jump force production, or YYIR2 performance, tested over the following 2 days. On the other hand, as we have discussed, studies of acute sleep deprivation, especially those measuring technical performance outcomes, tended to yield positive results. Given that sleep is often disrupted the night before athletic competition,66 athletes involved in sports requiring these types of skills are likely to be particularly sensitive to sleep manipulations and thus should be counseled regarding the importance of sleep for game performance. Relatedly, chronic sleep extension studies have demonstrated significant benefits to athletes.35,49 Thus, strategies to improve sleep not only the night before an important sports event but also in the weeks leading up to this event are likely to be fruitful in improving performance. In this review, we have summarized and synthesized recent findings in the realm of sports and sleep science. One of the challenges of conducting such a literature review is that the study methodologies vary a great deal, as do the individual sports, making comparisons of effects and magnitudes of effect sizes across studies difficult. Additionally, unlike many studies of athletic performance and sleep conducted in nonathletes and recreational sports players, studies incorporating high-level competitors are limited, especially those implementing experimental approaches. Even among the best-controlled studies, sample sizes are small and sleep measurements vary considerably, with some studies measuring sleep duration objectively through polysomnography or actigraphy and others relying on self-report. All of these factors limit the scope of the conclusions that can be drawn. Nevertheless, they do provide valuable information about when sleep does or particularly when sleep does not seem to play a key role in influencing performance. Future research may seek to use larger sample sizes and standardize tests of athletic performance in order to identify optimal sleep standards, in addition to standardizing sleep metrics and incorporating more objective sleep data. In particular, here we focused on studies investigating sleep duration, although sleep timing is likely to be a relevant factor as well. As sleep onset and wake time have previously been shown to influence performance and recovery,5 future studies should aim to incorporate this information. Given these suggestions for improving future research, there are many opportunities for innovative research on this topic. One area in particular may be about how generalizable these findings are to other sports. Given the wide range of methodologies and used in these studies, another research goal would be to harmonize measures across studies and conduct a meta-analysis. Another area to investigate is trade-offs between wake time activities (eg, athletic practice) and sleep. For example, is it beneficial for swimmers to practice early in the morning even at the expense of their sleep? Research also should seek to investigate the mechanisms by which aerobic, tactical, and technical performance attributes may be preferentially sensitive to changes in sleep patterns. One limitation of the present work is that although the number of hours and/or nights of sleep interventions across studies varied, sleep duration was only measured the night before performance assessment. Thus, in order to obtain a more complete picture of sleep quantity and quality, future research should aim to measure sleep across the entire study period. Another limitation is that few of the studies examined explicitly the relationship between subjective sleep quality and performance, especially using validated sleep quality questionnaires such as the PSQI and ESS. Thus, this remains an open question that will be important to be investigated in the future. Once all these data are gathered, feasible and effective interventions should be developed, implemented, and evaluated to improve the sleep health and optimal performance of athletes. In conclusion, the importance of sleep for professional athletes to achieve high performance varies by the cognitive and physical demands of the sport. However, because most sports require integration of aerobic fitness, tactical skills, and technical skills, competitive athletes will likely benefit from an increase in sleep duration.\\n \\nPage 1 of 1']\n",

The typical Japanese style of bathing involves filling the tub to shoulder depth with hot water at approximately 40°C\\x9642°C, and the study found that water temperature did not significantly affect the association between tub bathing frequency and CVD risk. Overall, this study provides interesting insights into the potential benefits of a common cultural habit.', 'Hey, did you hear about this new study on highly palatable food intake? They directly compared the effects of food cues and stress exposure on food craving and intake in a controlled hospital-based setting with healthy adults. The results showed that exposure to food cues and stress increased food cravings and subsequent snacking of highly palatable foods. In fact, food cravings predicted subsequent highly palatable food intake. The study also found that ghrelin and cortisol hormones play a role in food cue and stress-related food motivation and intake. This study highlights the need for further research to understand the biobehavioral processes that drive overeating and weight gain.', \"Hey, did you know that a new study found that frequent tub bathing is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease? The study was conducted on middle-aged Japanese men and women and found an inverse association between tub bathing frequency and risks of CVD, CHD, total strokes, and intracerebral hemorrhage. The study also found that frequent tub bathing was significantly associated with a lower risk of hypertension, suggesting that a beneficial effect of tub bathing on the risk of CVD may be in part due to a reduced risk of developing hypertension. The typical Japanese style of bathing involves filling the tub to shoulder depth with hot water at approximately 40°C\\x9642°C. The study also found that the potential beneficial effect of tub bathing of CVD events may be mediated by the reduced development of major cardiovascular risk factors in those who took tub bath frequently. Overall, it's a fascinating study that sheds light on the potential benefits of regular tub bathing.\", 'Hey, did you know that a new study found that frequent tub bathing may lower the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and strokes among middle-aged adults in Japan? The study was conducted over a long period of time and involved a large sample size, which makes the findings more reliable. Sauna bathing has been previously linked to a lower risk of fatal CVD and sudden cardiac death, but this is the first study to specifically look at the effect of tub bathing on cardiovascular health. The study also suggests that the potential beneficial effect of tub bathing on CVD events may be due to the reduced development of major cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension. The typical Japanese style of bathing involves filling the tub to shoulder depth with hot water at approximately 40-42°C, which is believed to improve vascular function over the long term. However, the negative aspect of tub bathing is that it can cause heatstroke more frequently when the tub water temperature is too high. Overall, this study provides interesting insights into the potential benefits of frequent tub bathing for cardiovascular health.', 'Hey, did you know that a new study found that hypohydration, or mild dehydration, can increase pain sensitivity in women? They found that after 24 hours of fluid restriction, pain tolerance decreased by 8% and pain intensity increased by 13% in women compared to when they were hydrated. Interestingly, menstrual phase did not affect pain sensitivity, but there was a positive correlation between 17?-estradiol levels and pain sensitivity. They also tested if acute water ingestion could remedy the negative effects of hypohydration on pain, but it did not reduce pain sensitivity. This study suggests that maintaining adequate hydration may be important in alleviating pain symptoms, especially for older adults who are more likely to be hypohydrated and experience chronic pain.', \"Hey, did you know that a new study found that sleep duration, quality, and midpoint are important determinants of postprandial glucose metabolism in healthy adults? This means that one-size-fits-all sleep recommendations may not be optimal for diabetes prevention. The study analysed both between-person and within-person effects and found that sleep duration, efficiency and midpoint are important determinants of postprandial glycaemic control at a population level, while illustrating that to optimise sleep recommendations it is likely necessary to tailor these to the individual. The study also found that sleep quality is more important than sleep duration with respect to glycaemic control. The study's findings may inform lifestyle strategies to improve postprandial blood glucose levels, focusing on earlier bedtime routines and maximising high-quality uninterrupted sleep.\", 'Hey, did you know that a new study found that sleep duration, quality, and midpoint are important determinants of postprandial glycaemic control in healthy individuals? This means that one-size-fits-all sleep recommendations may not be optimal for everyone, especially when it comes to preventing diabetes. The study analyzed both population-level and person-level effects of sleep on metabolic health and found that sleep duration was not a major determinant of glucose metabolism, but sleep quality was more important than sleep duration with respect to glycaemic control. The study also found that later sleep midpoint is associated with impaired postprandial glucose response to breakfast the following morning. Interesting, right?', 'Hey, did you know that a new study found that sleep duration, quality, and midpoint are important factors for maintaining healthy blood sugar levels after meals? The study analyzed data from a large population of healthy individuals and found that sleep recommendations should be tailored to the individual rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. Interestingly, the study found that sleep quality is more important than sleep duration for glycaemic control. The study also suggests that a high-fat breakfast may help mitigate the detrimental effects of poor sleep on postprandial glycaemia. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the interplay between sleep and metabolic health.', 'Hey, did you know that a new study found that taking frequent tub baths may lower the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in middle-aged Japanese individuals? The study followed a large population-based cohort and observed an inverse association between tub bathing frequency and risks of CVD, CHD, total strokes and intracerebral haemorrhage. Interestingly, tub bathing was not associated with a higher risk of sudden cardiac death. The study also found that the potential beneficial effect of tub bathing on CVD events may be mediated by the reduced development of major cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension. The typical Japanese style of bathing involves filling the tub to shoulder depth with hot water at approximately 40°C\\x9642°C. However, the study did not suggest any preferable water temperature, but further research regarding the water temperature is warranted. Overall, this is the first study to examine the long-term associations between tub bathing and CVD incidence using a large population-based cohort, and it suggests that habitual tub bathing may have a beneficial effect on the prevention of CVD.', 'Hey, did you know that a recent study analyzed the changes in metabolic rate across the human lifespan? They found that fetal metabolic rates are similar to adults, and there is a rapid acceleration in total and basal expenditure during the first year, which could be due to growth and development. As we age, our adjusted expenditures progressively decline, reaching adult levels at around 20 years old. However, there is considerable metabolic variation among individuals, with total energy expenditure and its components varying more than Â± 20% even when controlling for body composition, sex, and age. The study also challenges the assumption of continuity in tissue-specific metabolism over the life course, with size-adjusted metabolism being elevated ~50% in childhood compared to adults and ~25% lower in the oldest subjects. These findings could have implications for clinical investigation into disease kinetics, pharmaceutical activity, and healing, which are intimately related to metabolic rate.', 'Hey, did you know that a recent study analyzed the daily energy expenditure of humans throughout their life course? They found that metabolic rates change significantly across different stages of life. For example, total and basal expenditures accelerate rapidly during the first year of life, which corresponds to a critical period of early development. However, adjusted expenditures progressively decline thereafter, reaching adult levels at around 20 years old. Interestingly, tissue-specific metabolic rates are much higher in young individuals, particularly in organs like the brain and liver, and decrease in older adults. This could have implications for understanding the kinetics of disease and pharmaceutical activity. Additionally, there is considerable metabolic variation among individuals, even when controlling for fat free mass, fat mass, sex, and age. Overall, these findings challenge the common assumption of continuity in tissue-specific metabolism over the lifespan and suggest that understanding metabolic changes across the life course and among individuals could help reveal the roles of metabolic variation in health and disease.', 'Hey, did you know that a recent study analyzed the daily energy expenditure of humans throughout their lifespan? The study found that metabolic rates change significantly across the lifespan, with rapid acceleration in total and basal expenditure during the first year of life, followed by a progressive decline thereafter, reaching adult levels at around 20 years old.

These findings have important implications for understanding the roles of metabolic variation in health and disease.', 'Hey, did you know that a recent study conducted in a hospital-based setting found that exposure to both food cue and stress can increase highly palatable food craving and subsequent snacking of highly palatable foods? The study also found that food cravings predicted subsequent highly palatable food intake. The hormones ghrelin and cortisol seem to play a role in food cue and stress-related food motivation and intake. The results suggest that there is a need for further controlled studies to better understand the biobehavioral processes that drive overeating and weight gain.', 'Hey, did you know that a recent study found major changes in metabolic rate across the human life course? As infants, our metabolic rates are similar to that of adults, but then rapidly accelerate over the first year. Adjusted expenditures progressively decline thereafter, reaching adult levels at around 20 years. Interestingly, tissue-specific metabolic rates are much greater in organs like the heart, liver, brain, and kidneys compared to muscles and lean tissue or fat. This accounts for a greater proportion of fat free mass in young individuals, and thus organ-based basal expenditure follows a power-law relationship with fat free mass. However, observed basal expenditure exceeded organ-based estimates by around 30% in early life and was about 20% lower in subjects over 60 years. The study also found that variation in both physical activity and tissue-specific metabolism contribute to total expenditure and its components across the lifespan. Lastly, there is considerable metabolic variation among individuals, with total energy expenditure and its components varying more than Â± 20%.', 'Hey, did you know that a recent study found that high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs, specifically ibuprofen, can compromise muscle strength and hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young adults? The study showed that maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen can reduce muscle hypertrophy by 7.5% and attenuate increases in muscle strength, especially when training is performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The study also found that the negative effect of ibuprofen on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake, and that the drug can interfere with the normal hypertrophic development of 0.1–0.2% per day seen in other studies employing conventional resistance-training programmes for the knee extensors. The study provides strong proof-of-principle evidence that the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake, and the mechanistic findings should contribute to a better understanding of regulation of muscle growth in general.', \"Hey, did you know that a recent study found that mild dehydration can increase pain sensitivity in women by 13%? And even though menstrual phase did not affect pain sensitivity, women with higher levels of 17?-estradiol may be more sensitive to pain. The study also tested whether drinking water could alleviate the pain, but it didn't seem to have an effect. This is important because it suggests that staying hydrated throughout the day may help reduce pain perception in women.\", 'Hey, did you know that a recent study found that sleep duration, quality, and midpoint are important factors in regulating blood glucose levels in healthy adults? The study showed that one-size-fits-all sleep recommendations may not be optimal for everyone, and that personalized sleep guidelines may be needed to improve metabolic health and prevent diabetes. Interestingly, the study found that sleep quality may be more important than sleep duration in regulating glucose metabolism. The study also showed that a later sleep midpoint, such as going to bed later, is associated with impaired glucose response to breakfast the following morning. The findings suggest that improving sleep habits, such as earlier bedtime routines and maximizing high-quality uninterrupted sleep, may be important strategies for improving postprandial blood glucose levels.', 'Hey, did you know that a recent study found that there are no differences in the recovery response from high-volume resistance exercise between recreationally trained young and middle-aged adults? The study compared young adults (23-29 years) and middle-aged adults (41-42 years) and found similar changes in performance and markers of muscle damage and inflammation. Interestingly, the decline in strength may develop during middle age, but recovery from exercise seems to be maintained in recreationally trained individuals. The study also found that interleukin-6, an inflammatory cytokine, increased after exercise for both groups, but no significant changes were observed in C-reactive protein, another acute phase protein. These results suggest that middle-aged recreationally active men who regularly engage in resistance training do not seem to be at increased risk for greater soreness or muscle damage in comparison with younger recreationally trained men.', 'Hey, did you know that a recent study found that there are no differences in the recovery response from resistance exercise between young and middle-aged men? This study is the first to examine differences in recovery response from high-volume resistance exercise between recreationally trained young and middle-aged adults. Even though changes in strength may occur during middle age, recovery from exercise seems to be maintained in recreationally trained individuals. Additionally, the study found that interleukin-6, an inflammatory cytokine, increased after exercise in both young and middle-aged adults, but there were no significant changes in C-reactive protein, an acute phase protein. The research suggests that participating in recreational resistance training may mitigate any alteration in the recovery response from exercise.', 'Hey, did you know that a recent study found that there were no differences in the recovery response between young and middle-aged men after high-volume resistance exercise? This is the first study to examine differences in recovery response between these two age groups. The study also found that changes in muscle performance seem to begin during middle age, but participating in recreational resistance training may mitigate any alterations in the recovery response from exercise. Interestingly, there were no significant elevations in CRP concentrations after the exercise protocol, which suggests that training experience may have attenuated the CRP response. The study also noted that the exercise protocol was performed on an isokinetic dynamometer and used unilateral, single-joint exercise, so future research should examine modes of training specific to the typical training program of the participants.', 'Hey, did you know that a recent study found that there were no differences in the recovery response from resistance exercise between young and middle-aged men?

The study found that, at the group level, master athletes neither reach higher fatigue levels nor recover more slowly than the younger athletes. However, age-related differences were found within younger athletes reaching a higher post-exercise fatigue regarding muscle soreness and PPC. The study also looked at the effectiveness of a mixed-method recovery intervention (MMR) after resistance exercise, and found that it did not contribute to a faster recovery of physical performance, neuromuscular function, or muscle damage, but promoted recovery of perceptual measures regardless of age. However, some participants were more likely to benefit from MMR also in terms of functional and physiological measures.

The results showed that pain tolerance decreased by 8%, while pain intensity increased by 13% and pain unpleasantness increased by 12%. Interestingly, acute water ingestion did not reduce pain sensitivity, even though it decreased thirst perception. The study also found that hormonal fluctuations within the menstrual cycle do not significantly impact pain sensitivity. This study provides valuable information on the effects of hydration on pain perception in women and raises the question of whether hypohydration worsens chronic pain conditions.\", 'Hey, did you know that a study found that not drinking enough water can increase pain sensitivity in women? The study showed that mild hypohydration increased pain intensity by 13% and pain unpleasantness by 12% compared to being properly hydrated. Interestingly, menstrual phase did not affect pain sensitivity. The study also tested if drinking water could reduce pain sensitivity, but it did not have an immediate effect. This is important because many people are not properly hydrated and it could worsen chronic pain conditions. The study also highlights the importance of controlling or measuring hydration status in pain research.', 'Hey, did you know that a systematic literature review found that increasing sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance? None of the published studies reviewed found a negative association between sleep duration and performance outcome. Interestingly, aerobic activity seems to be more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity. This study also found that for outcomes requiring tactical and/or technical skills, most studies found benefits of sleep on performance. Interestingly, studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. Overall, this review provides valuable information about when sleep does or does not seem to play a key role in influencing performance among competitive athletes.', 'Hey, did you know that a systematic literature review showed that increased sleep duration has a positive effect on athletic performance and none of the reviewed studies found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome? The study also found that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity.

However, more research is needed to validate the various performance outcomes measured, especially those involving complex, team-based measures such as composite game performance scores and passing accuracy. Overall, the importance of sleep for professional athletes to achieve high performance varies by the cognitive and physical demands of the sport.', 'Hey, did you know that high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen can compromise muscle strength and hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young adults? A study showed that the maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen compromised muscle hypertrophy independent of training mode, and increased muscle strength was attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The study found that the negative effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake, and there may be distinct differences in the response to resistance training and NSAID consumption in the young vs. the elderly. This study provides strong proof-of-principle evidence that the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake.', 'Hey, did you know that high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen can compromise muscle strength and hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young adults? In a recent study, healthy young men and women performed 8 weeks of supervised resistance training with concomitant high- or low-dose NSAID treatment. The major findings were that maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen compromised resistance exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy independent of training mode and increases in muscle strength were attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The increase in muscle volume in the ASA group was of a similar magnitude to that previously reported by other studies, while the reduction in muscle hypertrophy in response to the ibuprofen treatment was quite remarkable. The study shows that daily consumption of high doses of NSAIDs attenuates strength and muscle hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young healthy individuals, and the effect of NSAIDs on muscle adaptations to resistance exercise is dependent on the dose of intake.', 'Hey, did you know that taking high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen can compromise muscle strength and hypertrophic adaptations to resistance training in young adults?

The major findings were that maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen compromised resistance exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy independent of training mode and increases in muscle strength were attenuated by ibuprofen only when training was performed with maximal all-out repetitions. The study also found that the only marked difference across medical treatment was a significant ibuprofen-induced reduction in IL-6 gene expression, which reflected a changed inflammatory environment that, speculatively, contributed to the attenuated hypertrophic development in the ibuprofen group. This study improves our understanding of how NSAIDs work and interacts with chronic exercise responses and has implications for the millions of individuals worldwide who consume NSAIDs on a regular basis while trying to obtain the best possible benefits of resistance training.', \"Hey, have you heard about exercise snacks? It's a new strategy to improve cardiometabolic health by performing isolated bouts of brief vigorous exercise multiple times throughout the day. Studies have shown that exercise snacks can improve cardiorespiratory fitness and exercise performance in previously inactive adults. Participants were instructed to safely ascend 60 steps in a three-flight stairwell as quickly as possible, followed by a dynamic warm-up and a 1-minute cooldown. The exercise snacks approach does not require all-out efforts and can be performed using both cycling-based and more practical stair-based protocols. There is also potential for exercise snacks to improve aspects of cardiometabolic health in individuals with obesity, but more research is needed in clinical populations.\", \"Hey, have you heard about exercise snacks?

It's a new strategy to improve cardiometabolic health. Studies have shown that isolated bouts of brief vigorous exercise, performed multiple times throughout the day, can improve cardiorespiratory fitness and exercise performance in inactive adults. For example, a protocol involving thrice daily ~15-30 seconds of hard effort involving cycling or stair climbing can lead to modest but significant improvements in CRF and peak power output. The best part is that exercise snacks can be easily implemented in a home, school or office-based setting. Moreover, recent work from the lab has also shown the potential for exercise snacks to improve vascular health by mitigating the detrimental effects of sedentary behavior on leg blood flow and shear stress. This approach aligns with the recently revised Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and the WHO Guidelines on Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior, which eliminated the previous requirement that physical activity had to be accumulated in bouts lasting at least 10 minutes. Isn't that interesting?\", \"Hey, have you heard about the new study on the benefits of tub bathing? Apparently, a long-term cohort study of middle-aged Japanese men and women found an inverse association between tub bathing frequency and risks of CVD, CHD, total strokes and intracerebral haemorrhage. They observed a lower risk of hypertension in those who took tub baths frequently, which may be in part due to the reduced development of major cardiovascular risk factors. The typical Japanese style of bathing involves filling the tub to shoulder depth with hot water at approximately 40°C\\x9642°C, and using water up to 42°C was found to have favourable effects in previous controlled trials. Although there are physiological differences between tub and sauna bathing, the potential beneficial effects of tub bathing on CVD events are believed to be similar to the impact of exercise and are mediated by improved vascular function. It's interesting that the study found a statistically significant inverse association between tub bathing and risk of CVD outcomes, even after adjusting for socioeconomic variables.\", 'Hey, have you heard of exercise snacks?

A recent study found that tub bathing was associated with a reduced risk of CVD, CHD, total strokes and intracerebral haemorrhage. This means that taking regular baths could potentially help prevent heart disease and stroke. The study also found that the potential beneficial effect of tub bathing on CVD events may be mediated by the reduced development of major cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension. So, if you're looking for a relaxing way to improve your heart health, taking a warm bath could be a great option. The typical Japanese style of bathing involves filling the tub to shoulder depth with hot water at approximately 40°C\\x9642°C. However, the study did not suggest any preferable water temperature, but further research regarding the water temperature is warranted. Overall, this is the first study to examine the long-term associations between tub bathing and CVD incidence using a large population-based cohort, and it suggests that habitual tub bathing may have a beneficial effect on the prevention of CVD.\", \"Hey seniors, did you know that taking frequent tub baths may lower your risk of cardiovascular disease?

A recent study conducted in Japan over a long period of time and with a large sample size found that the typical Japanese style of bathing, which involves filling the tub to shoulder depth with hot water at approximately 40-42°C, may improve vascular function over the long term. This is the first study to specifically look at the effect of tub bathing on cardiovascular health. The study also suggests that the potential beneficial effect of tub bathing on CVD events may be due to the reduced development of major cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension. However, it's important to note that tub bathing can cause heatstroke more frequently when the tub water temperature is too high. So, if you're a senior looking for a simple and enjoyable way to improve your cardiovascular health, consider taking frequent tub baths at a safe and comfortable temperature.\", \"Hey seniors, have you heard about the E-MECHANIC randomized controlled trial? It's a study that looked at the effects of exercise on weight loss in a 6-month program. The study found that participants who exercised at both 8 and 20 KKW (kcal/kg/week) doses compensated and lost less weight than expected. This means that they ate more food to make up for the calories they burned during exercise. The compensation was due to increased energy intake, not changes in metabolism or non-exercise physical activity. Interestingly, compensators were more likely to have metabolic syndrome and reported increased appetite and compensatory health beliefs. The study provides insight into how to reduce compensation during long-term exercise, which is important for seniors who want to maintain a healthy weight and improve their overall health.\", \"Hey seniors, have you heard about the E-MECHANIC study? It was a 6-month long study that looked at the effects of exercise on weight loss. The study found that participants who exercised actually lost less weight than expected. This was because they ended up eating more food to compensate for the extra energy they were burning. The study also found that those who compensated were more likely to have metabolic syndrome and reported feeling hungrier. It's important to keep in mind that exercise is still beneficial for overall health, but it's important to be mindful of what we eat to avoid compensating for the extra energy burned during exercise.\", \"Hey seniors, have you heard about the new study on the benefits of taking a relaxing bath? Apparently, a long-term study of middle-aged Japanese men and women found that taking frequent tub baths can lower the risk of heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure. The typical Japanese style of bathing involves filling the tub with hot water, which has been found to have favorable effects in previous studies. The potential beneficial effects of tub bathing on heart health are believed to be similar to the impact of exercise and can improve vascular function. It's interesting that the study found a statistically significant inverse association between tub bathing and risk of heart disease, even after adjusting for socioeconomic variables. So, why not take a relaxing bath and improve your heart health at the same time?\", 'Hey seniors, have you heard about the recent study on the benefits of taking a warm bath for your heart health? A long-term study in Japan found that taking frequent warm baths was associated with a lower risk of heart disease, strokes, and bleeding in the brain. Interestingly, taking a warm bath was not associated with a higher risk of sudden cardiac death. The study also found that taking warm baths may help reduce the development of major cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure. The typical Japanese style of bathing involves filling the tub to shoulder depth with hot water at approximately 40°C\\x9642°C, and the study found that water temperature did not significantly affect the association between taking warm baths and heart health. Overall, this study provides interesting insights into the potential benefits of a common cultural habit that seniors can easily incorporate into their daily routine.', \"Hey there! Did you know that getting enough sleep can have a positive impact on your physical performance, no matter your age? A recent review of scientific studies found that increasing sleep duration can improve athletic performance, and none of the studies reviewed found a negative association between sleep duration and any performance outcome. It seems that aerobic activity is more sensitive to sleep duration compared to anaerobic activity. Studies have shown that sleep deprivation can make exercise feel harder, which can affect endurance and explosive, power-based exercises. Additionally, the studies that altered sleep duration on a longer-term timescale were more likely to show an effect than those that altered sleep duration acutely. It's interesting to note that chronic sleep extension studies have demonstrated significant benefits to athletes, and this could be true for seniors as well. Overall, getting enough sleep is important for seniors to maintain their physical and cognitive abilities, no matter what activities they enjoy.\", 'Hey, did you know that getting enough good quality sleep is important for maintaining healthy blood sugar levels after meals? A recent study found that sleep duration, quality, and midpoint are all important factors. The study suggests that sleep recommendations should be tailored to the individual rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. Interestingly, the study found that sleep quality is more important than sleep duration for controlling blood sugar levels. The study also suggests that eating a high-fat breakfast may help mitigate the negative effects of poor sleep on blood sugar levels. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the connection between sleep and metabolic health, which is especially important for seniors.', \"Hey, did you know that getting enough quality sleep and going to bed at a reasonable time can help prevent diabetes? A recent study found that sleep duration, quality, and midpoint are important factors in controlling blood sugar levels after meals. This means that following a one-size-fits-all sleep recommendation may not be the best approach for everyone, especially seniors. The study found that sleep quality is more important than sleep duration when it comes to controlling blood sugar levels. Additionally, going to bed later in the night can lead to higher blood sugar levels the next morning. So, it's important for seniors to prioritize getting enough quality sleep and going to bed at a reasonable time to maintain good metabolic health.\", \"Hey, did you know that getting enough sleep can actually improve your physical performance?

      "\t['Comparisons in the Recovery Response From Resistance Exercise Between Young and Middle-Aged Men\\n\\nDiscussion\\nResults of this study indicated no differences in the recovery response between YA and MA for any of the performance measures, nor in subjective levels of muscle pain or soreness. Furthermore, no between-group differences were observed in the inflammatory or\\xa0muscle damage\\xa0response to the exercise protocol. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine differences in the recovery response from high-volume resistance exercise between recreationally trained young and middle-aged adults. Our results comparing BL performance measures seem to be in agreement with other investigations, demonstrating differences in strength measures between young (23\\x9629 years) and older adults (60\\x9665 years) (7,15,24), and between middle-aged (41\\x9642 years) and older adults (70\\x9672 years) (17,18). It does seem that the decline in strength may develop during middle age. However, recovery from exercise seems to be comparable in both younger and middle-aged adults as reflected by similar changes in performance and markers of\\xa0muscle damage\\xa0and\\xa0inflammation. Although changes in strength may occur in middle age, recovery from exercise does seem to be maintained in recreationally trained individuals.\\nThe differences observed at BL in isometric force and the rate of force development is consistent with other investigations comparing younger and older adults (16,19,36). Although differences in age between young and middle-aged adults do seem to affect BL levels of strength, it does not seem to affect recovery from exercise. This is supported by similar patterns of\\xa0muscle damage\\xa0and\\xa0inflammation\\xa0observed during the recovery period after the HVP. Elevations in Mb and CK concentrations are consistent with the expected physiological response from a bout of resistance exercise (9,34). These results also suggest that middle-aged recreationally active men who regularly engage in\\xa0resistance training\\xa0do not seem to be at increased risk for greater soreness or\\xa0muscle damage\\xa0in comparison with younger recreationally trained men.\\nSimilar response patterns were also noted in the inflammatory response for both groups. No significant elevations from BL were observed in CRP. However, significant increases in IL-6 concentrations were observed for both groups. Although CRP is an acute phase protein whose function is to activate the innate immune response and enhance phagocytosis (10), it does not seem to change after an acute bout of resistance exercise (6). Previous research has reported no significant changes in CRP concentrations after\\xa0resistance training\\xa0protocols recruiting primarily both upper-body (31) and lower-body exercises (4) in younger men. Furthermore, previous investigations have also indicated that training experience can reduce the CRP response to an acute bout of exercise (22,35). Considering that participants in both YA and MA were recreationally trained, it is likely that this training experience may have attenuated the CRP response. Physiologically, it is consistent with the lower stress and damage that occurs with repetitive training (9,35). Interleukin-6 is an inflammatory cytokine that facilitates communication for the mobilization, proliferation, and differentiation of immune cells to the site of tissue damage (6) and has been shown to increase after exercise (11). Elevations in IL-6 are related to the intensity, duration, and mode of training (11,13,32), but the literature is inconclusive regarding the IL-6 response to\\xa0resistance training. A recent study reported that a bout of high-volume resistance exercise (8 sets of 10 repetitions with 70% of maximal strength in the squat exercise) resulted in a significant elevation in IL-6 concentrations 30 min after exercise, but no changes were observed after a bout of high-intensity resistance exercise (8 sets of 3 repetitions with 90% of maximal strength in the squat exercise) in experienced, trained lifters (4). The IL-6 response observed during this investigation as a result of a bout of high-volume resistance exercise seems to be consistent with that recently reported by Bartolomei et al. (4). However, age did not seem to exacerbate nor attenuate the IL-6 response in recreationally trained participants.\\nNo differences were noted in the inflammatory or\\xa0muscle damage\\xa0response between YA and MA. As discussed earlier, this is likely related to the recreational training background of the participants. However, there were several limitations to the study that need to be acknowledged. The exercise protocol was performed on an isokinetic dynamometer, which may not have as much practical application as most\\xa0resistance training\\xa0programs use dynamic constant resistance exercises. In addition, unilateral, single-joint exercise recruited a relatively smaller muscle mass than is commonly used in most training programs. The use of this modality of exercise, which has been demonstrated to be very effective in eliciting\\xa0muscle damage\\xa0(20,30), may not have been sufficient to elicit significant performance and inflammatory changes in these recreationally trained participants. Future research should examine modes of training specific to the typical training program of the participants.\\nPractical Applications\\nThe results of this study indicate that changes in muscle performance seem to begin during middle age, even in recreationally trained individuals. However, participating in recreational\\xa0resistance training\\xa0may mitigate any alteration in the recovery response from exercise. These results should be examined in the context that recovery was investigated after a unilateral, single-joint isokinetic exercise protocol. Although this method has been previously used as an effective mode of exercise to elicit\\xa0muscle damage, it is not specific to the type of exercises typically used by recreational lifters. Future studies may wish to compare these population groups using multijoint, dynamic constant resistance exercises common to the training programs of most recreational lifters, regardless of age.', 'Recovery From Eccentric Squat Exercise in Resistance-Trained Young and Master Athletes With Similar Maximum Strength: Combining Cold Water Immersion and Compression\\n\\nDiscussion\\nThe study aimed at investigating the effects of aging on muscle soreness and muscle damage following an intensive squat exercise protocol as well as on age-related effects of a recovery intervention in tightly controlled populations of young and master athletes regarding their absolute performance level. As an important experimental precondition, all markers of fatigue and recovery showed a significant within-subject effect of time of measurement with strikingly more pronounced changes from pre- to post-exercise (Figure 2), while CK peaked at post-24 in most individuals. Usually, the highest CK activity is found at 24 or 48h post-exercise. A mean CK increase of up to two times the baseline and up to 800U/l in some individuals can be attributed to structural damage to muscle cells (Baird et al., 2012). Therefore, it can be concluded that the applied high-intensive and eccentric overloaded exercise protocol was acutely sufficiently fatiguing and well-chosen to produce ongoing muscle soreness and muscle damage, which confirms the findings from other studies (Proske and Allen, 2005;\\xa0Lavender and Nosaka, 2006;\\xa0Raeder et al., 2016a;\\xa0Bridgeman et al., 2017;\\xa0Thomas et al., 2018).\\nRegarding the first hypothesis, the master athletes neither reach higher fatigue levels nor recover more slowly than the younger athletes (rejection of hypothesis 1). These findings partly contradict the current literature suggesting that, for a similar exercise stimulus, a stronger level of fatigue might be reached, and a longer recovery period might be required before master athletes return to baseline levels (Fell and Williams, 2008). A faster acute recovery is, among other factors, attributed to physiological differences between young and older participants (e.g., phosphocreatine recovery and impaired oxygen supply;\\xa0Fell and Williams, 2008). Regarding long-term recovery, the common belief among athletes and coaches is that older athletes experience greater muscle damage and slower repair during and after highly intensive exercise because of minor anabolic stimulus. On the other hand, this aspect is still debated in the literature, since multiple methodological issues have to be addressed, such as gender differences, training status, training protocols, and measurements of the damage (Fell and Williams, 2008).\\nIt must be pointed out that master athletes experienced less pronounced acute internal load and perceptual fatigue (Tables 2\\xa0and\\xa03, and\\xa0Figure 2). Similarly, the PPC showed a lower acute post-exercise decrease in the master athletes compared with the young athletes. The higher BLa concentrations in the young athletes can be attributed to the higher number of repetitions during the final all-out set when participants were encouraged to perform until their momentary muscular failure (Table 3). It appears that the master athletes started into the final set more carefully and defensively while anticipating possible injury risks and the upcoming recovery demands. Furthermore, despite a similar leg muscle mass and a comparable level of maximum dynamic strength (Table 1), the samples clearly differed in their power capacities during the vertical jump test (Figure 1). A higher amount of type II fibers in younger athletes and a correspondingly stronger glycolytic activity can be assumed. Type II fibers are usually more susceptible to disruption leading to higher BLa and CK values in young athletes (Baird et al., 2012). Therefore, a final assessment of hypotheses 1 is difficult as internal and external loads were slightly different in both age groups.\\nRegarding the second hypothesis, it was assumed that CWI and CC, especially when used in combination and over a longer period, could improve post-exercise recovery by ameliorating edema, decreasing secondary exercise-induced muscle damage and the sensation of muscle soreness, improving the clearance of muscle metabolites, and increasing post-exercise parasympathetic activity (Ihsan et al., 2016;\\xa0Brown et al., 2017). However, on the group level and regardless of age, the current study revealed no effect of MMR on the recovery of performance or muscle contractile markers of fatigue and recovery (rejection of hypothesis 2). Additionally, MMR did not significantly improve the recovery of CK activity, although reductions in muscle soreness and improvements in PPC were evident after MMR. Such a finding is common, likely due to the analgesia and placebo effect attributable to CWI and CC (Leeder et al., 2012;\\xa0Poppendieck et al., 2013;\\xa0Ihsan et al., 2016;\\xa0Brown et al., 2017).\\nRegardless of age, the group-level results of the current study are both consistent and in contrast to the overall literature findings examining CWI or CC as recovery tools, with applied research showing both improved and unchanged or even impaired recovery of fatigue markers following CWI and CC (Leeder et al., 2012;\\xa0Poppendieck et al., 2013;\\xa0Hill et al., 2014;\\xa0Machado et al., 2016;\\xa0Marqués-Jiménez et al., 2016;\\xa0Brown et al., 2017). The inconsistent findings within the available studies can be explained by the different CWI and/or CC protocols used as well as the frequently reported extensive interindividual variations even in response to highly standardized training and/or recovery interventions (Pickering and Kiely, 2017;\\xa0Wiewelhove et al., 2021). A high interindividual variability in the observed response to recovery interventions is supported by the current study. Only three participants (i.e., participants 2, 8, and 10) did likely benefit from MMR. All other participants showed inconsistent/diffuse responses, while a positive effect of MMR on the recovery of performance tended to be more frequently observed in the younger athletes. The inconsistent responses could be explained by a possible inability of the MMR protocol to accelerate recovery, at least in terms of muscle performance and CK activity, as well as the complexity of the kinematics of exercise-induced fatigue, which may cause different effects within individual body systems. Genetic influences make an important contribution to these variations, while factors, such as sleep, psychological stress, habitual physical activity, and dietary intake, may also play important roles (Mann et al., 2014). Only dietary intake was standardized and controlled during the present study. Additionally, the amount of data was rather small. Thus, the effectiveness of MMR should be interpreted with great caution.\\nIt is also assumed that the effectiveness of a recovery intervention may differ more depending on the individual preferences and beliefs concerning the intervention rather than on age (Roelands and Hurst, 2020). For example, several participants from both age groups (i.e., participants 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, 14, and 16) showed a consistent positive response to MMR in subjective markers, but MMR likely only had a consistent positive impact on performance in participant 8, while the performance of participant 14 was likely to have benefited from PR. Conversely, participant 4 showed a positive response to MMR in MVIC force, resting twitch force, CMJ height, and serum concentration of CK, but had a negative response to MMR in both subjective markers. Therefore, the use of recovery methods post-exercise in general and of MMR in particular should be individualized regardless of age. However, considering only individual perceptions may be misleading for the restoration of performance and/or muscle function.\\nFurthermore, it is discussed in the literature whether a long-term application of recovery interventions might attenuate training-specific adaptations in long-term training intervention and how to balance possible deteriorations in training adaptations with the possible beneficial short-term recovery effects. For example,\\xa0Fröhlich et al. (2014),\\xa0Roberts et al. (2015), and\\xa0Poppendieck et al. (2020)\\xa0showed that the regular use of CWI after strength training sessions reduced long-term gains in muscle mass and strength. However, the effects were rather small and therefore only of practical relevance for a few elite athletes. In this study, MMR had not physiological effects on post-exercise recovery at the group level. Thus, possible negative effects of a long-term application of MMR on adaptations are most likely rather minor and negligible in most athletes.\\nFinally, some limitations of the study design must be considered which are (1) the small number and heterogeneity of selected young and elderly athletes and (2) the insufficient adjustment of internal and external loads. Regarding the sample size, we strictly followed the predefined inclusion criteria for both age groups, which were difficult to meet by the master athletes. More than fifty applicants had to be pre-tested to identify eight individuals reaching a minimum half squat 1RM of at least 120% of the individual body weight which was necessary to match the dynamic strength performance of both age groups and corresponds to an advanced resistance training status in older athletes (Santos Junior et al., 2021). Nevertheless, despite a comparable level of maximum dynamic strength and a similar body composition, the samples clearly differed in their power capacities. Noticeable in this regard were the significantly lower CMJ performance and twitch force (Figure 2) as well as the lower basic testosterone release in the older athletes (Table 1). It can be concluded that a complete performance matching was not realized; however, it was implemented as well as possible at least for the 1RM, which was defined as our primary inclusion criterion.\\nDifferences in the acute internal and external loads of the exercise program can be attributed to the higher number of repetitions during the final set as well as to a higher amount of type II fibers and a correspondingly stronger glycolytic activity in the younger athletes. Nevertheless, since no significant within-subject effect between the two cross-over parts was found for any of the fatigue and recovery markers, it appears that a sufficiently standardized and replicable protocol was prescribed.\\nConclusion\\nAt the group level, master athletes neither reach higher fatigue levels nor recover more slowly than the younger athletes. Age-related differences were only found within younger athletes reaching a higher post-exercise fatigue regarding muscle soreness and PPC. Furthermore, the results indicate that a mixed-method recovery intervention (MMR) after resistance exercise does not contribute to a faster recovery of physical performance, neuromuscular function, or muscle damage, but promotes recovery of perceptual measures regardless of age. However, some participants were more likely to benefit from MMR also in terms of functional and physiological measures. Therefore, the use of MMR should be individualized. As limitations, it has to be pointed out that our sample size was rather small and that a complete matching of population characteristics and exercise intensity was difficult under the ecological valid conditions of this study. Both may have affected the outcomes. We therefore recommend further studies under more controlled experimental conditions.\\n\\nPage 1 of 1']\n",

However, some individual participants did benefit from the MMR in terms of functional and physiological measures, so the use of recovery methods should be individualized. The study had some limitations due to a small sample size and difficulty in matching population characteristics and exercise intensity.', 'Hey, did you know that a recent study found that there are no differences in the recovery response from high-volume resistance exercise between recreationally trained young and middle-aged adults? The study compared young adults (23-29 years) and middle-aged adults (41-42 years) and found similar changes in performance and markers of muscle damage and inflammation. Interestingly, the decline in strength may develop during middle age, but recovery from exercise seems to be maintained in recreationally trained individuals. The study also found that interleukin-6, an inflammatory cytokine, increased after exercise for both groups, but no significant changes were observed in C-reactive protein, another acute phase protein. These results suggest that middle-aged recreationally active men who regularly engage in resistance training do not seem to be at increased risk for greater soreness or muscle damage in comparison with younger recreationally trained men.', 'Hey, did you know that a recent study found that there were no differences in the recovery response between young and middle-aged men after high-volume resistance exercise? This is the first study to examine differences in recovery response between these two age groups. The study also found that changes in muscle performance seem to begin during middle age, but participating in recreational resistance training may mitigate any alterations in the recovery response from exercise. Interestingly, there were no significant elevations in CRP concentrations after the exercise protocol, which suggests that training experience may have attenuated the CRP response. The study also noted that the exercise protocol was performed on an isokinetic dynamometer and used unilateral, single-joint exercise, so future research should examine modes of training specific to the typical training program of the participants.', 'Hey, did you know that a recent study found that there were no differences in the recovery response from resistance exercise between young and middle-aged men?
