We found no group difference in all cause mortality.\\nMost interventions aimed at reducing fracture risk target a drug therapy to people with osteoporosis because they are at high risk of fracture. This approach confers a large benefit to the individual and does so cost effectively, because few people need to be treated to avert one event. However, averting fractures in small numbers of people at high risk does not reduce the burden of fractures in the community.\\nThe population burden of fractures\\x97the number of events, morbidity, mortality, and cost to the community\\x97arises from the vast numbers of people with risk factors that confer a modest attributable risk to the individual.17\\xa0For example, most fragility fractures in the community arise among women with osteopenia (bone mineral density T score \\x962.5 to \\x961 SD) because they form the largest segment of the community.18\\xa0Likewise, most fractures attributable to nutritional inadequacy arise among the great many people with intakes of calcium and protein that are below recommended levels.19\\xa0This nutritional inadequacy confers a small attributable risk to the individual but accounts for a large attributable fraction of the fracture burden in the community as a whole. This is the Geoffrey Rose prevention paradox\\x97a community based approach producing a small benefit to an individual may still confer a large benefit to the community.17\\xa0Safety is essential because most individuals treated may derive little or no benefit from the intervention. For example, the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension study reduced blood pressure by replacing a \\x93western\\x94 diet with a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, and low fat dairy foods\\x97an approach associated with fewer cardiovascular events.20\\nComparison with other studies\\nMost nutrition based studies assessing antifracture efficacy in aged care residents and people in the community used pharmacological doses of calcium with or without vitamin D.21\\xa0In a meta-analysis of 17 of these studies, only two studies reported a reduction in fracture risk\\x97a study of nursing home residents with calcium intakes <600 mg/day and vitamin D concentrations <50 nmol/L and a community based study in women and men ?65 years of age with mean calcium intakes of 700 mg/day.21\\xa0In the remaining 15 studies, poor compliance, large numbers of dropouts, and a low prevalence of the risk factor may have contributed to the null findings.2223\\xa0Benefits are unlikely if the prevalence of a risk factor (such as inadequate calcium and protein intakes) is low.24\\xa0For example, in the meta-analysis, reduction in fracture risk reported with treatment was confined to the 7272 individuals with calcium intakes <700 mg/day (risk ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.89), not the 45?241 individuals with calcium intakes above 700 mg daily.21\\xa0The reduction in fracture risk observed with calcium and protein rich foods in this study may have been the result of attention to several of the above factors. Compliance was optimised by supervised provision and consumption of the foods. Participants lost to follow-up were replaced by newly admitted residents. We intentionally targeted a cohort at high risk for fracture in whom low calcium and protein intakes were common and so were likely to partly contribute to the already high fracture burden in this community.\\nMechanisms of fracture risk reduction\\nThis nutritional intervention produced two unanticipated novel observations. The risk reduction for falls and fractures was detected by three and five months, respectively, and the relative risk reduction for fractures was similar to that found in trials using potent antiresorptive therapy to treat people at high risk due to osteoporosis. The two most likely explanations for each of these observations is a risk reduction for falls and slowing progression of bone fragility. Insulin-like growth factor 1 increased in the intervention group only, whereas the decrease in appendicular lean mass was confined to controls, consistent with the notion that protein intakes of 1-1.5 g/kg/day is needed to prevent protein catabolism and preserve or increase muscle mass in older adults, particularly those at risk of malnutrition or frailty.25\\xa0The increase in serum C terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen and deterioration in tibial and radial total volumetric bone mineral density in controls was not seen in the intervention group, consistent with slowing of bone loss and slowing of microstructural deterioration.26\\xa0These changes were modest, but slowing microstructural deterioration disproportionately reduces progression of bone fragility because fragility increases as a power function to the bone loss producing it.27\\nMortality did not differ between the groups. Some, but not all, studies suggest that milk consumption is associated with increased mortality but consumption of yoghurt and cheese (fermented foods) with reduced mortality and favourable blood lipid profiles.282930\\xa0Fermented and non-fermented dairy foods were used during the intervention. Milk consumption did not differ between the intervention and control groups (data not shown).\\n',\n",

The study suggests that weight stigma may be a potential barrier to healthy behaviors, indicating that reducing weight stigma could improve population health. The research also shows that targeting health behaviors to achieve weight loss may not be effective, as weight stigma is associated with poorer health behaviors independent of BMI. The study used a large, national census-matched sample of US adults and found that weight stigma was prevalent across the weight spectrum. The study calls for more weight-inclusive approaches to health promotion in sports, such as removing stigmatizing language or weight outcomes from health policies and program objectives.',\n",

The study used high calcium and high protein dairy foods, which were provided and consumed under supervision to ensure compliance. The risk reduction for falls and fractures was detected within three and five months, respectively.

Most interventions aimed at reducing fracture risk target drug therapies to people with osteoporosis because they are at high risk of fracture. However, averting fractures in small numbers of people at high risk does not reduce the burden of fractures in the community.

       "array(['High Calcium and Protein Intake Reduces Fracture and Fall Risk in Older Adults: A Study Relevant for Active Individuals\\n\\nA recent study found that increasing calcium and protein intake in institutionalised older adults with sufficient vitamin D levels was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of fractures and falls. The intervention used high calcium and high protein dairy foods, which may help prevent protein catabolism and preserve or increase muscle mass in older adults. This study is particularly relevant for active individuals who want to maintain their bone health and reduce their risk of fractures and falls. The risk reduction for falls and fractures was detected by three and five months, respectively, making this a promising approach for those at high risk for fractures and low calcium and protein intake. Compliance was optimised by supervised provision and consumption of the foods. This approach may be more effective than targeting only those with osteoporosis, as it addresses a cohort at high risk for fractures and low calcium and protein intake.',\n",
       "       'Nutritional Intervention Using Dairy Foods May Reduce Risk of Fractures and Falls in Older Adults Who Enjoy Sports\\n\\nA cluster randomized controlled trial found that a nutritional approach using high calcium and high protein dairy foods to increase calcium and protein intakes in institutionalized older adults replete in vitamin D was associated with a 33% reduction in risk of fractures of any type, a 46% reduction in risk of hip fractures, and an 11% reduction in risk of falls relative to controls. This finding is relevant for older adults who enjoy sports as it highlights the importance of proper nutrition in reducing the risk of fractures and falls, which can be detrimental to an active lifestyle. The study also emphasizes the population burden of fractures and the potential benefits of a community-based approach to prevention.',\n",
       "       'Weight Stigma May Hinder Healthy Behaviors in Sports, Study Finds\\n\\nWeight stigma can negatively impact disordered eating, comfort eating, alcohol use, and sleep disturbance, according to a study published in the International Journal of Obesity. The study suggests that weight stigma may be a potential barrier to healthy behaviors in sports, indicating that reducing weight stigma could improve the overall health of athletes. The research also shows that targeting health behaviors to achieve weight loss may not be effective, as weight stigma is associated with poorer health behaviors independent of BMI. The study calls for more weight-inclusive approaches to health promotion in sports, such as removing stigmatizing language or weight outcomes from sports policies and program objectives. The study used a large, national census-matched sample of US adults and found that weight stigma was prevalent across the weight spectrum.',\n",
