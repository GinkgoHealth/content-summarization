Other questions will ask participants to choose a preferred option from a list of statements, or to choose if options are Essential, High Priority, Medium Priority, Low Priority, or Not a Priority. Within each category, there will be free text options for participants to provide additional comments/feedback.',\n",

Any items that do not achieve positive or negative consensus will be flagged for discussion at the online meeting.',\n",
       "   'Participants will then be invited to attend an online meeting to discuss the results from Questionnaire 1. Overall descriptive statistics for each item in Questionnaire 1 will enable participants to understand how their rating of an item compared with the average rating of all participants. Participants will be given the opportunity to discuss these items and the ratings with each other, with facilitators asking them to particularly focus on items that did not reach a positive or negative consensus. Participants may also merge or change the wording of items. Qualitative data from the online meetings will be transcribed via online meeting platforms and will be used to verify the discussions in the meetings. They will not be used for further analysis and will be discarded once Round 2 starts. All items that did not reach positive or negative consensus during Round 1, or the merged or modified version of these items agreed to during the online meeting, will be included in Questionnaire 2.',\n",

After Questionnaire 3, any items that reached positive consensus will be included in the best-practice statement, while any items that reached negative or no consensus will be removed.

       "   'Discussion and conclusion',\n",
       "   'In its current usage, many different terms are being used in Australia and globally to describe a range of fragmented activities, programmes and services offered and provided to people exiting custodial settings. ‘Throughcare’, ‘aftercare’, ‘throughcare and aftercare (TCAC)’, ‘community re-entry’ and ‘transitional programmes’ are some of the more commonly used terms. Moreover, there is no general expert consensus as to how these programmes should be defined, what are the minimum standard of services provided under these programmes, what best practice should comprise or how they should be funded, provided, monitored and evaluated. The absence of an agreed nomenclature for programmes and services offered to people exiting prisons results in the use of a variety of different terms that are open to differing interpretations and usage. This phenomenon may be associated with the fragmented programmes and services observed and the lack of a best-practice model for such programmes and services. This study will address this gap by achieving expert consensus on nomenclature and developing a set of best-practice principles for these programmes and services via a modified Delphi consensus process.',\n",
       "   'One main limitation of the Delphi process is that any questionnaire consensus can be substantially influenced by the choice of the rating scale and consensus criteria.',\n",
       "   '49',\n",
       "   ' However, open discussions during ‘Online meetings’ with experts will ensure the authenticity and strength of consensus. The strengths of this Delphi approach are that it is designed to elicit knowledge from a diverse range of experts, enabling the identification of (dis)agreements between them, while also aligning them with other existing work. Using a rigorous evidence-based Delphi approach and including national and international experts and stakeholders in our surveys and online meeting/s (during the consensus building phase), will enable us to establish and generate a list of agreed best-practice statements that will address the needs of people exiting custody in Australia and internationally. The use of REDCap to operationalise this Delphi method also entails advantages. Globally, researchers are increasingly using REDCap to develop and deploy electronic data collection tools to support their translational research. In contrast to conventional in-person interviews or hard-copy surveys, this method provides increased convenience for experts, facilitates remote participation, improves inclusion and enrolment/retention, and provides effective and efficient outreach.',\n",
       "   '42 43',\n",
       "   'It is anticipated that the findings from this study will help to consolidate the research and understanding of service provision by providing expert consensus on key issues surrounding programmes for people exiting prisons in Australia and globally. A common and expert understanding of the best-practice principles of these programmes will help to set core standards for service provision and research in this field by providing a concrete framework within which to design such programmes using evidence-informed best-practice guidelines. While this research will be conducted in Australia, results should be of international interest as common aims, elements and attributes underpin the delivery of these programmes across disparate jurisdictions. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented in a variety of organisational forums and conferences.',\n",

Any items that do not achieve positive or negative consensus will be flagged for discussion at the online meeting.',\n",
       "   'Participants will then be invited to attend an online meeting to discuss the results from Questionnaire 1. Overall descriptive statistics for each item in Questionnaire 1 will enable participants to understand how their rating of an item compared with the average rating of all participants. Participants will be given the opportunity to discuss these items and the ratings with each other, with facilitators asking them to particularly focus on items that did not reach a positive or negative consensus. Participants may also merge or change the wording of items. Qualitative data from the online meetings will be transcribed via online meeting platforms and will be used to verify the discussions in the meetings. They will not be used for further analysis and will be discarded once Round 2 starts. All items that did not reach positive or negative consensus during Round 1, or the merged or modified version of these items agreed to during the online meeting, will be included in Questionnaire 2.',\n",

       "   'Discussion and conclusion',\n",
       "   'In its current usage, many different terms are being used in Australia and globally to describe a range of fragmented activities, programmes and services offered and provided to people exiting custodial settings. ‘Throughcare’, ‘aftercare’, ‘throughcare and aftercare (TCAC)’, ‘community re-entry’ and ‘transitional programmes’ are some of the more commonly used terms. Moreover, there is no general expert consensus as to how these programmes should be defined, what are the minimum standard of services provided under these programmes, what best practice should comprise or how they should be funded, provided, monitored and evaluated. The absence of an agreed nomenclature for programmes and services offered to people exiting prisons results in the use of a variety of different terms that are open to differing interpretations and usage. This phenomenon may be associated with the fragmented programmes and services observed and the lack of a best-practice model for such programmes and services. This study will address this gap by achieving expert consensus on nomenclature and developing a set of best-practice principles for these programmes and services via a modified Delphi consensus process.',\n",
       "   'One main limitation of the Delphi process is that any questionnaire consensus can be substantially influenced by the choice of the rating scale and consensus criteria.',\n",
       "   '49',\n",
       "   ' However, open discussions during ‘Online meetings’ with experts will ensure the authenticity and strength of consensus. The strengths of this Delphi approach are that it is designed to elicit knowledge from a diverse range of experts, enabling the identification of (dis)agreements between them, while also aligning them with other existing work. Using a rigorous evidence-based Delphi approach and including national and international experts and stakeholders in our surveys and online meeting/s (during the consensus building phase), will enable us to establish and generate a list of agreed best-practice statements that will address the needs of people exiting custody in Australia and internationally. The use of REDCap to operationalise this Delphi method also entails advantages. Globally, researchers are increasingly using REDCap to develop and deploy electronic data collection tools to support their translational research. In contrast to conventional in-person interviews or hard-copy surveys, this method provides increased convenience for experts, facilitates remote participation, improves inclusion and enrolment/retention, and provides effective and efficient outreach.',\n",

       "   'It is anticipated that the findings from this study will help to consolidate the research and understanding of service provision by providing expert consensus on key issues surrounding programmes for people exiting prisons in Australia and globally. A common and expert understanding of the best-practice principles of these programmes will help to set core standards for service provision and research in this field by providing a concrete framework within which to design such programmes using evidence-informed best-practice guidelines. While this research will be conducted in Australia, results should be of international interest as common aims, elements and attributes underpin the delivery of these programmes across disparate jurisdictions. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented in a variety of organisational forums and conferences.',\n",
