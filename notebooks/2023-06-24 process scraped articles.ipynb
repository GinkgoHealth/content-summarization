Recommendations were assessed for consistency, concordance and whether supported by evidence.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> We identified 51 guidelines containing 923 recommendations published between 1999 and 2021 by multilateral agencies and international non-governmental organisations. Handwashing with soap is consistently recommended as the preferred method for hand hygiene across all community settings. Most guidelines specifically recommend handwashing with plain soap and running water for at least 20 s; single-use paper towels for hand drying; and alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) as a complement or alternative to handwashing. There are inconsistent and discordant recommendations for water quality for handwashing, affordable and effective alternatives to soap and ABHR, and the design of handwashing stations. There are gaps in recommendations on soap and water quantity, behaviour change approaches and government measures required for effective hand hygiene. Less than 10% of recommendations are supported by any cited evidence.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusion</strong> While current international guidelines consistently recommend handwashing with soap across community settings, there remain gaps in recommendations where clear evidence-based guidance might support more effective policy and investment.</p>\\n<h2 class=\"\">Data availability statement</h2>\\n<p id=\"p-68\">Data are available upon reasonable request.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-1\">This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution IGO License (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/igo/\" rel=\"license\">CC BY 3.0 IGO</a>), which permits use, distribution,and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

Using the definition set out in the Ottawa Charter, we consider settings as where ‘health is created and lived by people within the settings of their everyday life; where they learn, work, play and love’,<a id=\"xref-ref-15-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-15\">15</a> and include domestic, public and institutional settings. The practice of hand hygiene—and access to the facilities which enable this—is often limited in these community settings, particularly in low/middle-income countries.<a id=\"xref-ref-16-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-16\">16</a> In the domestic setting, 30% of the global population does not have access to a basic handwashing facility with soap and water at home,<a id=\"xref-ref-17-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-17\">17 18</a> with three-quarters of those living in low-income countries.<a id=\"xref-ref-17-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-17\">17</a> In institutional settings, an estimated 43% of schools worldwide do not have access to basic hand hygiene facilities,<a id=\"xref-ref-18-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-18\">18</a> but there are limited data for other institutional settings, such as the workplace and prisons and places of detention, and public settings, such as markets, transportation hubs, and places of worship.<a id=\"xref-ref-18-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-18\">18</a>\\n</p>\\n<p id=\"p-15\">Despite the international recognition of hand hygiene as a critical public health measure, a recent global assessment of government policies, planning and financing for hygiene found that while the majority of surveyed countries reported having national policies for hand hygiene, less than 10% had sufficient financing to implement them.<a id=\"xref-ref-19-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-19\">19</a> Various international guidelines with recommendations on hand hygiene for non-healthcare settings exist,<a id=\"xref-ref-13-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-13\">13 20–22</a> but it is unclear whether current international guidelines are comprehensive, consistent and based on the most rigorous evidence available. This review aims to summarise current international recommendations for hand hygiene in community settings, identify areas of consistency and concordance, and assess whether recommendations are evidence based.</p>\\n<h2 class=\"\">Methods</h2>\\n<p id=\"p-16\">This review follows the six stages of the Arksey and O’Malley methodological framework for scoping reviews.<a id=\"xref-ref-23-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-23\">23–25</a> Expert consultation (stage 6) was integrated throughout the scoping review process<a id=\"xref-ref-24-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-24\">24</a> to obtain feedback on the scope and conceptual framework and to identify any additional guidelines beyond those identified during the electronic search. Our review is described according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR)<a id=\"xref-ref-26-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-26\">26</a> and a PRISMA-ScR checklist is included in the <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-1\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental table A1</a>. The protocol was preregistered with OSF Registries.<a id=\"xref-ref-27-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-27\">27</a>\\n</p>\\n<h3 class=\"\">Supplemental material</h3>\\n<h3>Identifying the research question (stage 1)</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-18\">To identify and refine the research question, a conceptual framework was developed for this review and built around three key concepts: (1) hand hygiene, (2) non-healthcare settings and (3) current international guidelines (<a id=\"xref-fig-1-1\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F1\">figure 1</a>). In this review, we define hand hygiene as any action of hand cleansing for the purpose of removing or deactivating pathogens from hands.<a id=\"xref-ref-28-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28</a> Effective hand hygiene is defined as any practice which removes or deactivates pathogens from hands and thereby limits disease transmission.<a id=\"xref-ref-28-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28</a>\\n</p>\\n<p id=\"p-19\" class=\"first-child\">Conceptual framework for hand hygiene in community settings.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-20\">The first key concept in the conceptual framework—hand hygiene—covers four areas: effective hand hygiene, minimum requirements, behaviour change and government measures (<a id=\"xref-fig-1-2\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F1\">figure 1</a>). Effective hand hygiene refers to definitions and practices. Minimum requirements refer to the materials, services and infrastructure required for effective hand hygiene. Behaviour change denotes the appropriate behavioural performances that promote and sustain effective hand hygiene. Government measures concern actions taken by governments to ensure effective hand hygiene, which are categorised according to an established framework<a id=\"xref-ref-29-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-29\">29</a> as follows: policy and strategy; institutional arrangements; sector financing; planning, monitoring and review; capacity development; and equity.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-21\">The second key concept—community settings—is defined as settings where healthcare is not routinely delivered,<a id=\"xref-ref-28-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28</a> broadly spanning all places where people ‘learn, play, work and love’<a id=\"xref-ref-15-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-15\">15</a> and specifically including domestic, public and institutional settings. As these settings may not exclusively refer to physical settings,<a id=\"xref-ref-30-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30</a> the review also includes recommendations for vulnerable populations (eg, people experiencing homelessness) who may reside permanently or semipermanently in public spaces. Nursing homes, long-term care facilities, non-acute care facilities and home care are also included in the review under institutional settings, as the boundary between healthcare and non-healthcare settings is often unclear or recommendations for these subsettings may not be disaggregated, especially in the context of COVID-19 where people received care at home.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-22\">The third concept—guideline—is defined as a published document where the primary purpose is to provide specific guidance, in the form of recommendations, towards a course of action. A recommendation is defined as a statement designed to assist a targeted actor to make an informed decision on whether, when and how to undertake a specific action.<a id=\"xref-ref-31-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-31\">31</a> Our review is limited to international guidelines to identify generalisable recommendations of global relevance.</p>\\n<h3>Identifying relevant studies (stage 2)</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-23\">To identify relevant guidelines, the search strategy consisted of the following sources: (1) the WHO Institutional Repository for Information Sharing (IRIS) Database, (2) Google search engine, (3) websites of international organisations known to work on hand hygiene (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-2\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental file 1</a>) and (4) contacting experts. We searched the WHO IRIS Database using prespecified search terms related to hand hygiene, non-healthcare settings and guidelines (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-3\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental table A3</a>). The search in Google was carried out using the anonymous function in the web browser (Chrome) to reduce the influence of the reviewer’s (CM) individual search history. Search strings were constructed by using multiple combinations of search terms from <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-4\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental table A3</a>. The first 10 pages of Google were reviewed by one reviewer (CM). Documents that at first appeared related to the research question and met the inclusion criteria were included for further screening. Expert consultations were conducted with ‘Hand Hygiene for All’ Initiative core partners (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-5\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental table A4</a>) to identify potentially relevant guidelines. The reference lists of guidelines were also hand-searched for any additional relevant documents. The search was limited to English and French languages and publication date was restricted to 1 January 1990 onwards to identify current guidelines.</p>\\n<h3>Study selection (stage 3)</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-24\">Documents meeting the following criteria were included: (1) international guideline, (2) offers one or more recommendations on hand hygiene, (3) targets at least one community setting, as defined in the conceptual framework, (4) published by an international non-governmental organisation (NGO), multilateral agency or public health agency, (5) published in English or French, and (6) published between 1 January 1990 and 15 November 2021. The review excludes guidelines for humanitarian settings, as internationally agreed guidance on hand hygiene in humanitarian settings and complex emergencies is available through the Sphere standards for water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) promotion.<a id=\"xref-ref-32-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32</a> Only the most recent versions of guidelines were included, with previous versions of the same guidelines excluded. Country-specific guidelines were also excluded.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-25\">All documents retrieved from electronic searches and expert consultations were transferred to Mendeley<a id=\"xref-ref-33-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-33\">33</a> for de-duplication. Inclusion was completed in two stages: (1) title and abstracts were screened for eligibility by one reviewer (CM); and (2) full texts of all potentially eligible documents were retrieved and independently assessed for inclusion by two reviewers (CM and LB). Disagreement between reviewers on inclusion was resolved through arbitration by a third reviewer (OC).</p>\\n<h3>Charting the data (stage 4)</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-26\">Guideline characteristics and recommendations from included guidelines were double-extracted by two reviewers (CM and LB) using a standardised data extraction template in MS Excel<a id=\"xref-ref-34-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-34\">34</a> and then cross-checked for accuracy. As with inclusion, a third reviewer (OC) provided arbitration if agreement on extraction could not be reached. The data extraction form (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-6\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental table A5</a>) included information on guideline characteristics, such as author, year of publication, target setting and COVID-19 response, as well as 57 specific parameters related to the four areas of hand hygiene described in the conceptual framework (<a id=\"xref-fig-1-3\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F1\">figure 1</a>). Recommendations for each parameter were extracted from included guidelines where possible.</p>\\n<h3>Collating, summarising and reporting the results (stage 5)</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-27\">Guideline recommendations were first summarised for each parameter across community settings and then disaggregated by domestic, public or institutional setting where relevant. Definitions and recommendations for hand hygiene were assessed for consistency, concordance and whether supported by cited evidence. Recommendations were classified as consistent, fairly consistent or inconsistent if they featured in 10 or more, 4–9 or less than 4 guidelines, respectively. Concordance is here defined as parameters with no consistent or fairly consistent recommendations at odds with each other. We also used a hierarchical system to classify evidence cited for recommendations into five levels, adapted according to an established classification system<a id=\"xref-ref-35-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-35\">35</a>: (1) systematic review or meta-analysis, (2) randomised controlled trial or controlled trial without randomisation (eg, quasi-experimental), (3) guideline (either developed from systematic reviews or not developed from systematic reviews), (4) observational study (eg, cohort, cross-sectional, case–control studies), and (5) expert opinion or anecdotal information (eg, programme documentation). A recommendation was considered evidence based if the guideline provided a specific citation for the recommendation, which was coded according to the level of evidence cited. Finally, evidence gaps were defined as parameters with very few recommendations (ie, less than 10 recommendations, equivalent to less than 20% of guidelines providing a recommendation).</p>\\n<h3>Patient and public involvement</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-28\">There was no public or patient involvement in the course of this project.</p>\\n<h2 class=\"\">Results</h2>\\n<h3>Search results</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-29\">Electronic searches were conducted on 15 November 2021, identifying 3360 records (2432 from the WHO IRIS Database, 900 from Google, 28 from international agency websites) (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-7\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental table A2</a>) and a further 11 records identified through expert consultation. Following de-duplication, a total of 3132 records were screened by title and abstract, and 125 documents were sought for retrieval for full-text screening, with one document not accessible. Finally, 51 guidelines are included in the review (<a id=\"xref-fig-2-1\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F2\">figure 2</a>). The 73 documents excluded during the full-text review are listed in the <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-8\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental table A6</a> with reasons for exclusion.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-30\" class=\"first-child\">Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram.</p>\\n<h3>Description of included guidelines</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-31\">The 51 included guidelines were published in English between 1999 and 2021, with 38 published in 2020 or later and 31 providing guidance specifically on hand hygiene to help prevent the transmission of COVID-19. Among the 51 included guidelines, 67% are published by multilateral agencies (WHO, UNICEF, United Nations High Comissioner for Refugees and International Labour Organization), 23% by international NGOs, and 10% by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-9\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental table A7</a>). Most guidelines target public and institutional settings, while none exclusively target the domestic setting. More specifically, 43% (n=22) target the public setting, 43% (n=22) the institutional setting, 4% (n=2) the domestic and public setting, and 10% (n=5) more than one setting (eg, domestic, public and/or institutional). Of the 22 guidelines for the public setting, 20 concern public spaces and 2 concern vulnerable populations within public spaces (eg, people experiencing unsheltered homelessness and people living in dense, informal settlements). For institutional settings, eight guidelines concern schools, six the workplace, four prisons and places of detention, three places of worship, and one long-term care facilities and home care. Almost no guidelines, however, define a community setting. The majority of recommendations are generalisable to high-income, medium-income and low-income settings. Overall, we extracted 923 recommendations from the 51 included guidelines (<a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-10\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental table A8</a>).</p>\\n<h3>Recommendations for effective hand hygiene</h3>\\n<h4>Hand hygiene definitions</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-32\">Only 10% of guidelines provide a clear definition for hand hygiene or safe or effective hand hygiene.<a id=\"xref-ref-36-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-36\">36–40</a> Meanwhile, 75% of guidelines provide at least one recommendation on when to practise hand hygiene, referred to in our review as a ‘key moment’. Guidelines use inconsistent terms for defining when to practise hand hygiene, such as ‘key times’ (14%),<a id=\"xref-ref-37-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-37\">37 41–46</a> ‘critical times’ (8%)<a id=\"xref-ref-47-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-47\">47–50</a> and ‘key moments’ (4%).<a id=\"xref-ref-21-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-21\">21 51</a> Otherwise, guidelines either do not use a specific term for defining a key moment (49%) or do not recommend at least one key moment (25%).</p>\\n<h4>Hand hygiene practices</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-33\">There is agreement among guidelines on what constitutes effective hand hygiene across community settings, although there are gaps in recommendations on how to practise effective hand hygiene. Almost all guidelines (90%) recommend washing hands with soap and for the duration of at least 20\\u2009s (27%) (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-1\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>). In addition, 63% of guidelines recommend the use of ABHR as an alternative or complement to handwashing with soap, though very few guidelines recommend duration for hand rubbing. There is a lack of recommendations on handwashing or hand rubbing technique (16%),<a id=\"xref-ref-21-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-21\">21 40–42 47 52–54</a> with two of these guidelines (25%, n=2)<a id=\"xref-ref-21-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-21\">21 40</a> referring to the WHO instructions for hand hygiene in healthcare settings.<a id=\"xref-ref-28-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28</a> Meanwhile, 24% of guidelines recommend the inclusion or provision of simple instructions on handwashing technique in hygiene promotion programmes, yet none of these guidelines include specific steps on handwashing or hand rubbing technique.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-34\" class=\"first-child\">Consistent and fairly consistent recommendations for hand hygiene in community settings</p>\\n<p id=\"p-37\">Guidelines provide inconsistent recommendations on when to practise hand hygiene. Over 30 different individual key moments are recommended among the guidelines. Despite this inconsistency, the individual key moments most commonly mentioned include ‘before and after eating’, ‘after using the toilet’, ‘before and after preparing food’, ‘after blowing nose, coughing or sneezing’, and ‘after touching public surfaces or objects’ (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-2\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>). The latter two feature most commonly among guidelines published during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fairly consistently recommended individual key moments include ‘when entering or exiting the home or public space’, ‘after changing a child’s diaper’ and ‘when hands are visibly dirty’. Almost all guidelines recommend clusters of key moments (ie, individual key moments recommended together). The most common ones are ‘after using the toilet’ with ‘before and after eating’ (39%, n=20); ‘after using the toilet’ with ‘before and after preparing food’ (24%, n=12); and ‘after using the toilet’ with ‘before and after eating’, and ‘after blowing nose, coughing or sneezing’ (22%, n=11).</p>\\n<h3>Recommendations for minimum requirements</h3>\\n<h4>Handwashing materials</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-38\">Guidelines consistently recommend plain soap for handwashing across all community settings and paper towels or electric dryers for hand drying in public and institutional settings. Most guidelines (65%) do not recommend a specific type of soap for handwashing, though some specifically recommend bar soap (24%), liquid soap (22%) or ‘soapy water’ (eg, home-made mixture of powder or liquid soap, or bar soap shavings diluted in water) (16%) (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-3\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>). No guidelines specifically recommend antibacterial soap. For hand drying after handwashing, most guidelines recommend clean, single-use paper towels (39%) and electric air-drying systems (22%) in public and institutional settings. Eight per cent of guidelines recommend a bin with disposal liners and lid for the waste management of paper towels in public and institutional settings.<a id=\"xref-ref-21-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-21\">21 55–57</a> No guidelines provide a recommendation for hand drying materials in the domestic setting.</p>\\n<h4>Soap and water requirements for handwashing</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-39\">While guidelines consistently recommend running water for handwashing with soap, there are gaps for soap and water quantity and discordant recommendations on water quality for handwashing. For water services, almost half (43%) of guidelines recommend running water, 16%\\u2009a piped water system connected to a tap, and 14% water trucking, storage or manual refilling. Few guidelines recommend a minimum quantity of liquid or bar soap (14%)<a id=\"xref-ref-43-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-43\">43 48 58–61</a> or water (18%)<a id=\"xref-ref-12-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12 20 47 50 60–62</a> required for handwashing (eg, minimum amount of water needed to wet hands or soap product necessary to cover all surfaces of hands for handwashing with soap) (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-2-1\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T2\">table 2</a>). One guideline, for example, recommends less than 5\\u2009mL of liquid soap per person per handwashing event,<a id=\"xref-ref-60-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-60\">60</a> whereas three other guidelines recommend at least 250 g of bar soap per person per month for handwashing.<a id=\"xref-ref-43-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-43\">43 48 61</a> For water quality, 16% of guidelines state that water must be of drinking water quality, in line with WHO guidelines.<a id=\"xref-ref-21-5\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-21\">21 40 41 52 54 63–66</a> In contrast, 8% state that it does not have to be of drinking water quality,<a id=\"xref-ref-12-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12 20 39 67</a> though none specify a quantitative standard nor whether non-drinking quality water may conditionally be used if high-quality water is not available. In addition, 10% of guidelines recommend that free residual chlorine must be greater than or equal to 0.5\\u2009mg/L after at least 30\\u2009min of contact time.<a id=\"xref-ref-43-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-43\">43 48 63 68 69</a>\\n</p>\\n<p id=\"p-40\" class=\"first-child\">Parameters with gaps in recommendations (ie, fewer than 10 recommendations, equivalent to less than 20% of guidelines providing a recommendation)</p>\\n<h4>Alternative materials for hand hygiene</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-42\">There are consistent recommendations for ABHR as an alternative material for hand hygiene. Of the guidelines that recommend ABHR, 35% (n=18) recommend ABHR with at least 60% alcohol, 22% (n=11) do not specify an alcohol percentage and only 6% (n=3) recommend an alcohol percentage of at least 70%. In addition, 18% of guidelines recommend ABHR where soap and water are not available<a id=\"xref-ref-37-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-37\">37–39 41 42 52–54 70</a> and 10% (n=5) only if hands are not visibly soiled.<a id=\"xref-ref-21-6\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-21\">21 36 40 65 71</a>\\n</p>\\n<p id=\"p-43\">There are discordant recommendations for the use of ash. Twenty-two per cent of guidelines recommend ash as an alternative material to soap for handwashing.<a id=\"xref-ref-12-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12 36 43 45 47 52 64 65 71–73</a> In addition, 14% recommend ash if ABHR or soap is not available.<a id=\"xref-ref-12-5\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12 43 45 47 52 64 73</a> However, 6% (n=3) of guidelines advise against the use of ash or other products, such as soil, sand, mud or water alone.<a id=\"xref-ref-45-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-45\">45 47 62</a> In addition, while some guidelines (8%) recommend 0.05% chlorine solution,<a id=\"xref-ref-48-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-48\">48 53 54 63</a> one guideline advises against it.<a id=\"xref-ref-13-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-13\">13</a>\\n</p>\\n<p id=\"p-44\">When disaggregated by setting, ABHR is most consistently recommended in public and institutional settings where it may meet larger and more frequent demand than handwashing stations. Similarly, recommendations for the conditional use of ABHR where soap and water are not available feature the most in the institutional setting, particularly in the workplace and schools. Ash is most commonly recommended in the public setting, which includes low-resource and water-scarce settings where soap and water may not be available.</p>\\n<h4>Hand hygiene stations</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-45\">Overall, there are inconsistent recommendations on hand hygiene facilities and their location, as well as gaps. Across all settings, guidelines recommend washbasins (eg, ceramic, cement or plastic) (16%), a bucket or container connected to tap (14%) and tippy taps (12%) for handwashing stations (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-4\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>). Guidelines specify 16 different locations for handwashing stations, which include by the entrance and exit of public spaces and buildings (eg, restaurants, shops, markets, places of worship, train and bus stations) (27%), in close proximity to toilets (27%), and next to food preparation and eating areas (18%). Guidelines also mention placing hand hygiene stations, such as ABHR dispensers, at key entry and exit points of public spaces and buildings (14%). There are inconsistent recommendations on the optimal spacing and number of users per handwashing station, whereas none for ABHR dispensers. Gaps in recommendations include those for hand hygiene materials and product supply chains, cost and affordability, functionality, durability, and hand hygiene station operation and maintenance responsibilities and actions (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-2-2\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T2\">table 2</a>).</p>\\n<p id=\"p-46\">Recommendations on the location of handwashing stations vary slightly by setting. Close proximity to toilets is consistently recommended for both public and institutional settings (10% and 14%, respectively). By the entrance and exit of public spaces is most consistently recommended for public settings (24%). Next to food preparation and eating areas is most consistently recommended for institutional settings (12%), such as schools and the workplace.</p>\\n<h4>Hand hygiene station access and adaptations</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-47\">Guidelines recommend hand hygiene stations that are accessible for all and adapted for pandemic response. For example, 10% of guidelines recommend that the height of soap and water taps be appropriate for access by children, the elderly and disabled (eg, 500–700\\u2009mm basin height for children and 850\\u2009mm basin height for wheelchair access) (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-5\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>). Forty-five per cent (n=23) of guidelines recommend COVID-19-related adaptations for hand hygiene stations, such as taps that limit cross-contamination (16%), 1–2 m spacing between stations (12%), regular tap disinfection (10%), and towels for opening and closing taps (8%). Other adaptations include theft resistance (eg, attaching soap or other movable pieces to the station) (16%) and water-saving designs (eg, low-flow faucets) (12%).</p>\\n<h3>Recommendations for behaviour change</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-48\">Overall, there are few recommendations related to hand hygiene behaviour change, though there are consistent recommendations on behaviour change messaging and delivery channels. For behaviour change messaging, some guidelines (10%) recommend messages that target ‘motives’<a id=\"xref-ref-74-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-74\">74</a> (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-6\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>).<a id=\"xref-ref-20-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-20\">20 45 54 64 71</a> In terms of delivery channels, 31% of guidelines recommend using visual reminders (eg, signs, posters or leaflets) and 24%\\u2009mass communication (eg, radio, social media or mobile phone text messaging) to deliver behaviour change messages. Prompts, cues and habit formation are fairly consistently recommended as behaviour change techniques.<a id=\"xref-ref-20-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-20\">20 39 52 67 71 75–78</a> Formative research for behaviour change programmes is recommended by 10% (n=5) of guidelines,<a id=\"xref-ref-46-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-46\">46 47 49 72 76</a> though only 8% (n=4) specifically mention undertaking formative research to identify behavioural determinants among the target population.<a id=\"xref-ref-46-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-46\">46 47 49 72</a> Guidelines provide inconsistent recommendations on behaviour change approaches (18%), determinants of hand hygiene to target for interventions (22%), and behaviour change models or frameworks (33%). Lastly, there are gaps in recommendations on frequency of behaviour change interventions (ie, how often an intervention should be delivered) and behaviour change approaches (4%)<a id=\"xref-ref-20-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-20\">20 46</a> (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-2-3\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T2\">table 2</a>).</p>\\n<h3>Recommendations for government measures</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-49\">Overall, few guidelines (22%, n=11) provide a recommendation on government measures. Nonetheless, recommendations for sector policy and strategy include promoting local soap production and fostering public–private partnerships for handwashing (4%).<a id=\"xref-ref-47-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-47\">47 49</a> For institutional arrangements, 4% of guidelines suggest identifying ways of cross-sectoral collaboration for hand hygiene,<a id=\"xref-ref-20-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-20\">20 49</a> while other recommendations centre on engaging communities, the private sector and civil society for the delivery of WASH services.<a id=\"xref-ref-12-6\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12 65</a> On planning, monitoring and review, 4% of guidelines recommend supporting or reinforcing existing monitoring systems or creating a government-led national monitoring system, in line with global hygiene indicators.<a id=\"xref-ref-49-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-49\">49 68</a>\\n</p>\\n<h3>Evidence-based recommendations</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-50\">Of the 923 recommendations extracted from the 51 included guidelines, most (93%) do not have a citation for one of the five levels of evidence identified for the review (ie, systematic review, randomised and quasi-randomised trial, guideline, observational study or anecdotal information) (<a id=\"xref-fig-3-1\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F3\">figure 3</a>). Of the remaining 7% of recommendations, less than 1% cite evidence from a systematic review.<a id=\"xref-ref-46-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-46\">46</a> In addition, less than 1% cite evidence from a randomised or quasi-randomised trial,<a id=\"xref-ref-12-7\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12 36</a> while over 1% cite evidence from observational studies, which are mainly recommendations for alternative hand hygiene materials, such as ash, sand and soil, or alternative water sources for handwashing, such as cooking or laundry water, bathwater and seawater.<a id=\"xref-ref-12-8\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12 36 47</a> Less than 1% of recommendations cite other guidelines developed from systematic reviews,<a id=\"xref-ref-21-7\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-21\">21 47 67 70</a> while 2.5% cite other guidelines not developed from systematic reviews,<a id=\"xref-ref-51-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-51\">51 56 57 65 71 78 79</a> such as WHO interim guidelines for hand hygiene in the context of COVID-19.<a id=\"xref-ref-51-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-51\">51 56 57 65 71 78 79</a> The other 2% of recommendations cite anecdotal information, such as programme documentation.<a id=\"xref-ref-45-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-45\">45 47 62 76</a>\\n</p>\\n<p id=\"p-51\" class=\"first-child\">Percentage of recommendations cited by one of the five types of evidence or no evidence.</p>\\n<h2 class=\"\">Discussion</h2>\\n<p id=\"p-52\">We identified 51 guidelines published between 1999 and 2021 by various international agencies covering a range of community settings. Most guidelines target the public and institutional settings, while surprisingly none exclusively target the domestic setting. Overall, community settings are not clearly defined among the guidelines, which presents an opportunity for future normative guidelines to establish a clear and common definition, especially as it relates to hand hygiene. Overall, no guidelines comprehensively address hand hygiene across domestic, public and institutional settings, and very few recommendations are evidence based, highlighting a gap in global normative guidance on hand hygiene in community settings.</p>\\n<h3>Effective hand hygiene</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-53\">There is agreement among guidelines on what constitutes effective hand hygiene; however, inconsistencies and gaps remain as to when and how to practise hand hygiene. Current recommendations for handwashing with soap reflect findings from published literature, which show that handwashing with soap is an effective means for preventing the transmission of a range of diseases.<a id=\"xref-ref-3-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-3\">3–9</a> Regarding when to practise hand hygiene, future guidelines could focus key moments on those most likely to interrupt the transmission of infectious diseases in domestic, public and institutional settings. These might include ‘after using the toilet’ to reduce the transmission of diarrhoea-causing pathogens,<a id=\"xref-ref-9-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-9\">9</a> and ‘after touching high-contact surfaces’ or ‘after coughing or sneezing’ to reduce the risk of respiratory infections.<a id=\"xref-ref-3-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-3\">3</a> Lastly, gaps in recommendations on handwashing and hand rubbing technique present an opportunity for future guidelines to recommend the optimal technique for reducing bacterial load on hands.</p>\\n<h3>Minimum requirements</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-54\">Consistent recommendations for the use of soap and water and ABHR suggest the widespread acceptability of these materials for effective hand hygiene across community settings. Current recommendations for the use of plain soap are consistent with findings from a systematic review that suggest that plain soap is more effective than antibacterial soap at removing or inactivating pathogens on hands in community settings.<a id=\"xref-ref-80-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-80\">80</a> Recommendations for running water are equally relevant as unreliable water supply negatively affects households’ ability to perform hand hygiene.<a id=\"xref-ref-81-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-81\">81</a> Gaps in recommendations on minimum quantities of soap and water required for effective hand hygiene are also important for future guidelines to address. The recommended use of ABHR with at least 60% alcohol is in line with several studies which have found that ABHRs with an alcohol concentration between 60% and 80% are more effective at killing germs than those with a lower alcohol percentage, particularly in clinical settings.<a id=\"xref-ref-82-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-82\">82 83</a> Although ABHR can still inactivate many types of microbes when used correctly, evidence suggests that soap and running water are still more effective at removing certain types of pathogens that may be present on hands.<a id=\"xref-ref-1-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-1\">1</a> The WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care, for example, recommend ABHR as the preferred method for routine hand hygiene in healthcare settings when hands are not visibly soiled, as it enables more frequent hand hygiene.<a id=\"xref-ref-28-5\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28</a> Similarly, in community settings, ABHR may be suitable in contexts where frequent hand hygiene is necessary, such as transport hubs and entrances or exits to public spaces and buildings.<a id=\"xref-ref-84-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-84\">84</a> ABHR may also be favourable where frequent hand hygiene is required, as the repeated use of soap can result in skin dryness and cause chronic irritant contact dermatitis.<a id=\"xref-ref-28-6\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28</a> However, in certain domestic, public and institutional settings, such as the household or schools, where hands may become more soiled, ABHR may be less likely to effectively inactivate microbes.<a id=\"xref-ref-82-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-82\">82 83</a> As per current international guideline recommendations, handwashing with soap may therefore be prioritised in these settings, with ABHR as a suitable complement or alternative where frequent hand hygiene is required. Finally, because the transmission of germs is more likely to occur to and from wet hands, hand drying is an essential component of effective hand hygiene, especially for handwashing.<a id=\"xref-ref-85-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-85\">85</a> Current recommendations for hand drying in public and institutional settings are consistent with those in the WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care, which recommend that hands should ideally be dried with individual paper towels, otherwise with air dryers.<a id=\"xref-ref-28-7\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28</a> While there is mixed evidence for the most effective hand drying method,<a id=\"xref-ref-86-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-86\">86</a> the WHO recommendations are based on findings that suggest that paper towels may effectively prevent recontamination of hands, while also lowering the risk of spreading pathogens through the air compared with electric air dryers.<a id=\"xref-ref-85-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-85\">85</a>\\n</p>\\n<p id=\"p-55\">Discordant recommendations for minimum requirements suggest the need to leverage further research to determine the optimal water quality for handwashing and effectiveness of alternative materials for hand hygiene where soap and ABHR are not widely available. Limited evidence suggests that the use of non-potable water with low-to-moderate levels of <em>Escherichia coli</em> contamination may still be effective for handwashing,<a id=\"xref-ref-87-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-87\">87</a> which may be promising for areas where it is difficult to regularly treat water or where there is intermittent water supply that is prone to contamination. Similarly, two studies found that drinkable water may not be needed for handwashing with soap.<a id=\"xref-ref-88-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-88\">88 89</a> Nevertheless, the WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care recommend washing hands with clean, running water whenever possible.<a id=\"xref-ref-28-8\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28</a> While there are discordant recommendations for the use of ash, there is uncertain evidence whether this stops or reduces the spread of pathogens compared with hand cleansing with soap, mud, soil or no hand cleansing.<a id=\"xref-ref-90-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-90\">90</a> Future guidelines may consider the efficacy of hand hygiene products along with their availability and acceptability in domestic, public and institutional settings to make relevant recommendations, particularly in water-scarce regions or settings where there is limited access to soap or ABHR. For example, soapy water may be a promising low-cost and effective alternative to bar soap in settings where bar or liquid soap is unaffordable.<a id=\"xref-ref-91-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-91\">91</a> In addition, one interim guideline on hand hygiene practices in low-resource settings, for example, recommends the use of friction-generating materials where clean, running water, soap or ABHR is not available.<a id=\"xref-ref-36-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-36\">36</a>\\n</p>\\n<p id=\"p-56\">Current inconsistent recommendations for hand hygiene facilities and their placement may limit the practice of effective hand hygiene. Sustaining hand hygiene behaviour change requires consistent access to functional hand hygiene stations at key locations,<a id=\"xref-ref-92-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-92\">92 93</a> and diverse infrastructure is recommended with varying costs. Nonetheless, the appropriateness of these recommendations is likely to depend on the local availability and affordability of materials. One guideline, for example, provides technical recommendations for permanent and semipermanent handwashing facilities in public places and buildings, focusing on the sustainability and equitable access of these facilities.<a id=\"xref-ref-20-5\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-20\">20</a> Similarly, future guidelines may prioritise the accessibility, affordability, and sustainability of materials and infrastructure for hand hygiene across all community settings to address current inconsistent and discordant recommendations. The accessibility and sustainability of hand hygiene stations are particularly important to ensure that they are inclusive and kept functional and well stocked beyond their installation.<a id=\"xref-ref-20-6\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-20\">20</a>\\n</p>\\n<h3>Behaviour change</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-57\">The gaps in recommendations related to behaviour change suggest the need for guidance based on established behavioural theory and existing evidence. There are some recommendations for behaviour change, though without clear steps on how to develop, implement and sustain hand hygiene behaviour change interventions. Future guidelines may benefit from leveraging well-established behavioural frameworks and theories<a id=\"xref-ref-94-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-94\">94–96</a> to make recommendations as to how to develop effective, locally appropriate strategies beyond information-focused communication. In addition, while most behaviour change theories and frameworks recommended among the guidelines note the importance of formative research, very few guidelines recommend undertaking formative research. Yet, formative research plays a key role in adapting hand hygiene behaviour change programmes to high-risk populations and target settings.<a id=\"xref-ref-97-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-97\">97</a>\\n</p>\\n<h3>Government measures</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-58\">The significant gaps in recommendations on government measures underscore the current lack of normative standards to guide national governments on the planning, delivery, financing and monitoring of effective hand hygiene. Indicators also suggest inadequate planning and insufficient funding for hand hygiene among national governments globally.<a id=\"xref-ref-19-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-19\">19</a> Future guidelines may therefore consider prioritising government measures to support countries in responding to and preventing public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Future guidelines may also focus recommendations on hand hygiene monitoring and reporting to improve comparison of hand hygiene indicators within and between countries.</p>\\n<h3>Strengths and limitations</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-59\">This review has four main limitations. First, as a scoping review, we did not systematically assess the quality of the included guidelines, although we did, for example, consider aspects such as the extent to which recommendations were based on cited evidence. In addition, included guidelines covered WASH and public health topics beyond hand hygiene, so it was thus not necessarily relevant to assess the whole guidelines for quality, but rather focus on the robustness of the specific recommendations for hand hygiene. Second, the search was limited to guidelines published in English or French and therefore may have excluded relevant guidelines published in other languages. Third, the lack of recommendations for government measures among current international guidelines may not reflect an absolute absence of guidance in this area. Guidance to governments on how to improve uptake of hand hygiene practices in community settings may be included in other sector documents or policy instruments. Fourth, while recommendations were summarised across domestic, public and institutional settings, there were often too few recommendations for each setting to assess consistency and concordance. Still, with 51 guidelines providing over 900 recommendations for hand hygiene in community settings, findings from this review highlight significant gaps and inconsistencies across community settings that future guidelines may seek to prioritise.</p>\\n<h2 class=\"\">Conclusion</h2>\\n<p id=\"p-60\">This review identified 51 current international guidelines providing 923 recommendations for hand hygiene in community settings. Nonetheless, there are several important areas of discordance and significant gaps in the recommendations among these guidelines. Furthermore, very few recommendations are supported by any qualifying evidence. The COVID-19 pandemic led to numerous national, regional and international efforts to improve effective hand hygiene in domestic, public and institutional settings, such as households, public spaces, workplaces and schools, but the lack of clear recommendations supported by cited evidence may limit progress in this important area of public health.</p>\\n<h2 class=\"\">Data availability statement</h2>\\n<p id=\"p-68\">Data are available upon reasonable request.</p>\\n<h2 class=\"\">Ethics statements</h2>\\n<h3>Patient consent for publication</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-69\" class=\"ethics-consent-to-publish\">Not required.</p>\\n<h3>Ethics approval</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-70\" class=\"ethics-approval\">This research did not require institutional review board approval as the data were publicly available and collected from existing online databases and search engines.

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Background: </span>Self-medication counseling in community pharmacies plays a crucial role in health care. Counseling advice should therefore be evidence-based. Web-based information and databases are commonly used as electronic information sources. EVInews is a self-medication–related information tool consisting of a database and monthly published newsletters for pharmacists. Little is known about the quality of pharmacists’ electronic information sources for evidence-based self-medication counseling.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>Our aim was to investigate the quality of community pharmacists’ web-based search results for self-medication–related content in comparison with the EVInews database, based on an adjusted quality score for pharmacists.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>After receiving ethics approval, we performed a quantitative web-based survey with a search task as a prospective randomized, controlled, and unblinded trial. For the search task, participants were instructed to search for evidence-based information to verify 6 health-related statements from 2 typical self-medication indications. Pharmacists across Germany were invited via email to participate. After providing written informed consent, they were automatically, randomly assigned to use either web-based information sources of their choice without the EVInews database (web group) or exclusively the EVInews database (EVInews group). The quality of the information sources that were used for the search task was then assessed by 2 evaluators using a quality score ranging from 100% (180 points, all predefined criteria fulfilled) to 0% (0 points, none of the predefined criteria fulfilled). In case of assessment discrepancies, an expert panel consisting of 4 pharmacists was consulted.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>In total, 141 pharmacists were enrolled. In the Web group (n=71 pharmacists), the median quality score was 32.8% (59.0 out of 180.0 points; IQR 23.0-80.5). In the EVInews group (n=70 pharmacists), the median quality score was significantly higher (85.3%; 153.5 out of 180.0 points; <i>P</i>&lt;.001) and the IQR was smaller (IQR 125.1-157.0). Fewer pharmacists completed the entire search task in the Web group (n=22) than in the EVInews group (n=46). The median time to complete the search task was not significantly different between the Web group (25.4 minutes) and the EVInews group (19.7 minutes; <i>P</i>=.12). The most frequently used web-based sources (74/254, 29.1%) comprised tertiary literature.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>The median quality score of the web group was poor, and there was a significant difference in quality scores in favor of the EVInews group. Pharmacists’ web-based and self-medication–related information sources often did not meet standard quality requirements and showed considerable variation in quality.<br></p>\n",

       "<h4>Background</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The treatment of clinical complaints with over-the-counter (OTC) products plays a substantial role in health care [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></span>]. Community pharmacists are often the first and only point of contact within the health care system for self-medication–related inquiries [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></span>]. Self-medication counseling by pharmacists can contribute to a cost-effective, individualized, safe medical care on the patient level and consequently to a relief of the burden of the entire health care system [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref3\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref4\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></span>]. External evidence is required for well-grounded consultations and a key factor within the 3-fold evidence-based pharmacy (EbPharm) concept, which derived from evidence-based medicine [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref5\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></span>]. Apart from external evidence, the pharmacist’s practical experience and the patient’s preference should be considered when counseling [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref6\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref7\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></span>]. However, a lack of information sources, time, and search skills has been identified as common barriers to EbPharm [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref8\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref18\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></span>]. Consequently, various evidence-based information resources were introduced to reduce the evidence-to-practice gap. Among all information sources, electronic sources are of increasing importance for pharmacists [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref19\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref20\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></span>]. The majority of information sources are however not targeted for community pharmacists, especially not in the context of self-medication counseling [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref21\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref29\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></span>]. The EVInews project is an example for an electronic, evidence-based self-medication–related information platform for community pharmacists in Germany [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref30\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Little is known about the quality and the kind of electronic information sources that pharmacists use for evidence-based self-medication counseling. Information quality in the context of health is defined as a multidimensional concept that describes the fulfillment of individually predefined criteria [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref31\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref32\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></span>]. Several attempts have been made to measure the quality of electronic information sources through validated instruments [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref33\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref39\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></span>]. Standard categories of these instruments address an information source’s transparency, accuracy, completeness, and readability for instance [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref40\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></span>]. These instruments help identify valid information among the increasing body of available electronic data. Previous instruments, as a limitation, were only used for patient-oriented websites.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">To date, literature about the quality of pharmacists’ electronic information sources for self-medication counseling has been scarce. In particular, studies that investigate the quality based on appropriate standard quality criteria of such electronic information sources are missing.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Study Objectives</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Our aim was to investigate the quality of community pharmacists’ web-based search results for self-medication–related content when using the internet in comparison with the EVInews database, based on an adjusted quality score for pharmacists. Furthermore, this study attempted to explore what types of web-based sources are used for evidence-based self-medication counseling and how much time is needed under everyday practice conditions.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Methods\" data-label=\"Methods\">Methods</h3>\n",
       "<h4>Study Design</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A quantitative, unblinded, prospective randomized controlled trial including a web-based survey with an unblinded search task and a parallel study design was carried out between February 1, 2021, and April 30, 2021. The survey and data collection were conducted using SoSci Survey, Leiner DJ (version 3.1.06). Participating pharmacists were automatically assigned through the randomization function of the software in a 1:1 allocation ratio to either study group after giving their informed consent.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Study Population and Setting</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Community pharmacists across Germany within 5 different federal pharmacy chambers (Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower Saxony, and Saxony) were invited via an email to participate remotely and anonymously without any incentives. For this purpose, invitations containing the survey were sent via email to all community pharmacies that agreed to receive survey invitations and were listed in the email list of each federal pharmacy chamber. The completeness rate of the survey and time needed for completion were assessed through the SoSci Survey software. A reminder email was sent after 1 month if less than 15 participants within a pharmacy chamber were enrolled. Participants had to be licensed pharmacists to be included in the study.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Study Groups</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Participants were instructed to solely use either web-based information sources of their choice except for the EVInews database (web group) or exclusively the EVInews database (EVInews group). The EVInews group accessed the database via the link provided [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref41\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></span>] and a test account.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Survey Structure</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The survey was divided into 3 main categories as follows: sociodemographic data, verification of 6 health-related statements with assigned information source type from 2 typical self-medication indications (search task), and self-evaluation of search skills and feedback.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Search Task</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Participants of both study groups were asked to verify 6 health-related statements from 2 typical self-medication indications (Table S1 in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app1\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 1</a></span>) with a quote and the corresponding information source (search task). Of the 6 statements, 3 belonged to the self-medication indications recurrent herpes labialis and female androgenetic alopecia, respectively<i>.</i> The indications were chosen deliberately because they require specific knowledge but are nonetheless relevant for everyday practice, and content was available in the EVInews database.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A video and a short written summary were presented to all participants to inform them about the study protocol. The 3 statements of each indication were then displayed in an alternating order based on the software’s Rotate Blocks function to the participants. This was used to prevent learning effects and therefore a distortion of the results. Participants were then instructed to copy and paste their quote and link of the information source that proved or disproved the correctness of each statement in designated textboxes.</p>\n",
       "<h4>The EVInews Database</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The EVInews project was launched in 2017 and is based on the resolution of the Federal Union of German Associations of Pharmacists (ABDA) to help implement EbPharm into everyday practice. It consists of a website with general EbPharm information, monthly published newsletters, and a corresponding document-oriented database, which are free of charge. Once registered, users can access the database through a login. Independent pharmacists from the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at Leipzig University compose the newsletters with editorial assistance from AVOXA—Media Group German Pharmacist GmbH.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Quality Score</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">An adjusted quality score was used to assess the information sources that were used for the search task. Therefore, a rating scheme for the evaluation of the search task was created (Table S2 in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app2\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 2</a></span>).</p>\n",
       "<h4>Rating Scheme</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Rating scheme criteria were chosen and adapted based on validated quality scores and questionnaires reported in the literature [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref35\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref37\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></span>] as well as previous findings [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref32\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref39\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref42\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref44\" rel=\"footnote\">44</a></span>]. The rating scheme consists of 18 nominal- to ordinal-scaled criteria that address predefined quality standards. We selected existing and added new criteria that were relevant for the search task. The rating scheme criteria were grouped together in the categories “transparency,” “quality of evidence,” and “usability” for the information sources and “accuracy” for the evaluation of the quotes. Each quote’s accuracy was evaluated subjectively with regard to logic, rationale, and comprehension and objectively based on a summative content analysis. Of all items, 12 had a dichotomous response format and 6 had an ordinal response format.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Quality Assessment Procedure</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Participants’ quotes and sources were independently evaluated by 2 evaluators (MR and JMA) based on the rating scheme and merged after analysis completion. A total median was calculated based on the 2 different evaluations. The maximum quality score for a quote and information source for all 6 statements accounted to 180 points (ie, all criteria were fulfilled). Each rater was requested to provide reasons for point allocation.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Study Subgroups</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Because not all participants completed the search task of the survey, a subgroup analysis of these participants was performed as demonstrated in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure1\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 1</a></span>. Participants who chose at least 1 answer option including “I do not know” within the search task were defined as “met the eligibility criteria (‘all’).” Participants who chose 1 answer option and verified at least 1 statement with a quote and source were defined as “completed search task partially (subgroup ‘completed partially’).” Participants who verified all 6 health-related statements were defined as “completed search task fully (subgroup ‘completed fully’).”</p>\n",
       "<h4>General Study Procedure</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The study procedure is shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure2\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 2</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The survey consisted of 32 questions, which included close-ended and open-ended questions. Dichotomous, 4-point Likert scales and multiple-choice answer options were given. The level of measurement ranged from nominal- to ordinal-scaled data.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Outcome Parameters</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The primary outcome parameter was the difference in quality scores between the study groups. Secondary outcome parameters included a subgroup analysis, quality scores of the rating scheme categories of transparency, quality of evidence, and usability, the characterization of web-based information sources, a correlational analysis of sociodemographic characteristics and quality scores, a self-evaluation of search skills by the participants, and assessment of the time needed to perform the search task.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Sample Size</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The estimated sample size was calculated using the G*Power, software, Faul F, Erdfelder E, Buchner A, Lang AG (version 3.1). No information regarding the primary target distribution was available. Based on the results of a pilot test, a double-sided Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test for nonparametric, independent samples was used a priori to determine the required sample size for a significant difference in quality scores. At a significance level of α=.05 and a CI of 95%, a sample size of at least 44 pharmacists per group would provide a power of 1 – β=.80. We estimated attrition to be 50% and consequently strived for a greater sample size.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Data Analysis</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Only data of participants who processed the search task and did not violate the study protocol were included in the data analysis. The analysis was performed using Excel (versions 2105 and 2016; Microsoft Corp) and SPSS Statistics (version 25 and 26; IBM Corp). Results for the primary target parameter (quality score) were expressed as median and first and third quartile (Q<sub>25</sub>/Q<sub>75</sub>). They were compared using a 2-sided Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test for independent samples. The comparison of quality subscores was performed likewise with a Bonferroni correction. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the responses. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate the relationship between quality scores and sociodemographic data.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Quality Assurance Means</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">To ensure feasibility and exclude comprehension difficulties, pretests and pilot tests were conducted between October 26, 2020, and January 19, 2021. The pretests were carried out with 23 pharmacists. The first 12 pretests were executed using the think-aloud method, the remaining using the standard observation before the test. After a revision and adjustment of the survey and rating scheme, a pilot test with 37 pharmacists and advanced pharmacy students as pretesters was performed, resulting in minor modifications. Furthermore, to reduce subjective judgment on each quote’s suitability (item 4d within the rating scheme), 1359 relevant keywords in English and German were identified during the pretest phase and used for a summative content analysis. The frequency of these predefined keywords was measured through the Excel (Microsoft Corp) count function for each quote. To assess whether difficulties occurred during the completion of the search task, participants were asked to rate the clarity of this survey and give qualitative feedback if desired. Data generated by the pretest and pilot test were not included in this study.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Quotes and sources that were not analyzable based on the rating scheme by at least one of the evaluators were presented to an expert panel in May 2021. The expert panel consisted of 4 pharmacists specialized or mostly in continuing education to become a pharmacist with a focus on drug information, who were not involved in the EVInews project. Consensus-based point allocation was ultimately done by vote for the remaining uncertainties.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">To examine whether differences in rater performance were present, interrater reliability was assessed using the Cohen κ statistic. The Cohen κ coefficient for each item of the rating scheme and subsequently for all rating scheme items was calculated and compared with the qualitative interrater reliability descriptors by Landis and Koch [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref46\" rel=\"footnote\">46</a></span>].</p>\n",

       "<h4>Participant’s Characteristics</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The participant flowchart (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure1\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 1</a></span>) depicts the participants who have been enrolled.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The participant’s characteristics are summarized in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table1\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 1</a></span>. Of all 141 participants, 110 (78.0%) were female and 31 (22.0%) were male. The median age interval was between 41 and 50 years (31/141, 22.0%) and more than half of all participants had more than 11 years of work experience (79/141, 56.0%). A reminder email was sent to the members of the Pharmacy Chamber of Saxony because of a low response rate in the first round.</p>\n",

       "<h4>Primary Outcome Parameter: Quality Score</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The median quality score of the Web group (n=71 pharmacists) was 32.8% (59.0 out of 180.0 points) and that of the EVInews group (n=70) was 85.3% (153.5 out of 180.0 points, <i>P</i>&lt;.001; <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure3\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 3</a></span>). The variability of the quality score in the Web group (IQR 23.0-80.5) was larger than that in the EVInews group (IQR 125.1-157.0). <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table2\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 2</a></span> displays all quality score results.</p>\n",

       "<h4>Secondary Outcome Parameters</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Results of the subgroup analysis of the subgroups entitled “completed partially” and “completed fully” are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table2\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 2</a></span> and illustrated in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure3\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 3</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Quality scores per rating scheme category were calculated and revealed statistically significant differences, as shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table3\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 3</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The web-based information sources that were provided by the participants for the search task varied greatly, as illustrated in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app3\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 3</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A total of 254 out of potentially 426 web-based information sources (6 statements × 71 participants) were given by 71 participants within the study arm of the web group to verify 6 health-related statements. A list of references was enclosed in 42.9% (109/254) of all web-based sources. Information about the author was provided in 69.7% (177/254) of all the web-based sources, and 34.3% (87/254) were published within the last 3 years (reference date February 1, 2021).</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The results of the correlational analysis are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table4\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 4</a></span>. A 2-tailed statistical significance was only detected for the positive correlation between the participant’s estimated annual frequency of searches and quality scores for both study groups and a negative correlation between the age, professional experience, and quality scores within the EVInews group.</p>\n",
       "<p><sup>a</sup>OTC: over-the-counter.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The responses of the self-evaluation (web group, n=44; EVInews group, n=58) were as follows. A total of 25% (11/44) of participants within the web group agreed fully that they were able to find the desired information in contrast to 71% (41/58) of the EVInews group. Furthermore, 46% (20/44) of the participants within the web group indicated that they conducted between no literature searches with literature databases such as MEDLINE via PubMed and 39% (17/44) to up to 12 per year in comparison with 40% (23/58) of the EVInews database users and 35% (20/58), respectively. Moreover, 39% (17/44) of participants of the web group estimated their search ability to find evidence-based self-medication information to be “rather good” and 5% (2/44) to be “very good.” Within the EVInews group, 59% (34/58) regarded their search ability to be “rather good” and 9% (5/58) to be “very good.” A total of 72% (42/58) of the EVInews group indicated that they were not familiar with the database before the study participation.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The times needed for the search task completion are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table5\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 5</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The median for the search task completion was 25.4 (IQR 12.7-43.5) minutes in the web group and 19.7 (IQR 13.6-28.4) minutes in the EVInews group. The completion times include participants who chose the escape option “I don’t know.”</p>\n",
       "<h4>Quality Assurance: Rater Performance</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The extent of agreement between the 2 raters measured using the Cohen κ statistic was “almost perfect” (κ=0.81-1) for the rating scheme items 1, 2, 4a, 4d-13, and 15-18. The extent of agreement on items 14 complied with “substantial agreement” (κ=0.780), items 3 and 4c with “moderate agreement” (κ=0.41-0.60), and item 4b with “slight agreement” (κ=0.077). All values were significantly different from zero (<i>P</i>&lt;.001). The extent of agreement in the form of an overall interrater descriptor for all rating scheme items accounted to κ=0.854.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Discussion\" data-label=\"Discussion\">Discussion</h3>\n",
       "<h4>Principal Findings</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">We found that the median quality score was significantly lower in the web group than in the EVInews group. Additionally, the variability of median quality scores in the web group was significantly larger and less participants completed the search task fully compared to the EVInews group. Web-based sources often did not meet standard quality requirements. The time needed for the search task completion did not reveal any considerable differences between the 2 groups. The data suggest that community pharmacists struggled to find web-based high-quality, evidence-based information sources for self-medication under everyday practice conditions.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Differences in Quality Scores and Potential Causes</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The web group obtained a significantly lower quality score with 32.8% of criteria fulfilled in comparison to 85.3% in the EVInews group. Several explanations for this result are possible. The statistically significant difference in quality scores may be explained by a lack of transparency information of many web-based sources, which ultimately resulted in lower scores. Examples of missing transparency information include publication dates, literature references, or authorship information. An analysis of the categories transparency and quality of evidence confirmed the persisting difference in scores in favor of the EVInews group.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Furthermore, a subgroup analysis was conducted because the difference in quality could be caused by participants who mostly chose the escape answer option “I don’t know.” A significant difference in quality scores remained when only data from participants, who verified all 6 health-related statements, were included.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The differences in quality scores between the participants could also be explained by personal factors such as different levels of work experience, knowledge, and the skills needed to quickly find suitable external evidence on the internet. However, significant differences in sociodemographic data between both groups were not existent. According to our correlational analysis, there was a positive association between the participant’s estimated annual literature searches and quality scores in both study groups. A negative correlation between the participant’s age as well as professional experience in years and quality scores was only observed within the EVInews group. This may indicate that with increasing practical literature search experience, the ability to find appropriate evidence could increase but with increasing age and professional experience decrease. The factors age and professional experience however only seemed to be associated with the quality scores of the EVInews group. It should be taken into consideration that EbPharm has been established in recent years, and therefore pharmacists who were trained over 30 years ago may not be familiar with this concept. Abu Farha et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref10\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></span>] similarly demonstrated a negative correlation among pharmacists between the familiarity with evidence-based medicine terms and professional experience.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Need for Customized Evidence-Based Information Sources for Pharmacists</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Most of the web-based information resources consisted of tertiary literature in the form of nonscientific pharmacy journals of varying quality and timeliness. Some information resources were 20 years old. Despite its simple nature as a document-oriented database, the majority of participants using the EVInews database “agreed fully” (41/58, 71%) in contrast to the web group (11/44, 25%) that they were able to find the desired information. Users need to sign in before accessing the EVInews database. The login with a username and password is comparable to other information platforms of this kind. This may be regarded as an obstacle to the database’s usage for everyday practice. However, when customers or other health professionals seek evidence-based advice related to OTC products, pharmacists may often not be able to immediately provide all the necessary information anyways. These cases require a search for external evidence under everyday conditions such as simulated in our study. The ability to find the desired information when confronted with such a search task is therefore of great importance and even greater importance than retrieval speed from our point of view. Nonetheless, it remains unknown how much low-quality sources impact the overall consultation quality. Furthermore, the dropout rate was greater in the web group. Only 22 participants within the web group in comparison with 46 within the EVInews group completed the entire search task and verified all 6 health-related statements.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Although the information retrieval times did not differ significantly, the participant’s search results under everyday practice conditions clearly did. An implication of this is the possibility that the participants were simply overwhelmed with the search task because they lacked the necessary search skills and therefore did not complete it fully. Subsequently, this leads to the question: what information do pharmacists rely on when selling OTC products if they cannot find it? These data may furthermore suggest that there is a need for training on how to find and appraise evidence as well as evidence-based information sources for community pharmacists. Because a lack of information sources and search skills is a common barrier to the implementation of EbPharm, information tools may help reduce the evidence-to-practice gap. The EVInews database fulfilled a majority of the standard quality requirements. Once further adjusted, it may be a promising electronic information tool for community pharmacists for evidence-based counseling.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Limitations</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A Hawthorne effect may have influenced the participants’ search behavior in both groups, prompting them to look for the very best evidence in the trial setting. Because of the web-based format, they were, however, not directly observed, and therefore this effect probably plays a minor role.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Raters and participants were not blinded. Because the type of information sources the users were allowed to use was predefined, blinding was not possible. To minimize subjective evaluation, a quantitative approach for the quality evaluation with objective criteria was chosen to ascertain a robust rating performance.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Only 2 OTC-relevant indications were chosen for the search task (Table S1 in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app1\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 1</a></span>). It remains questionable whether these 2 indications were adequate for the search task. Customers’ inquiries regarding the evidence or verification of advertising statements for the treatment of female androgenetic alopecia or recurrent herpes labialis are nonetheless common in everyday counseling practice and were therefore included in this study. Furthermore, on the basis of the pretests and pilot tests, we made sure that there is enough citable literature in German and English available to complete the search task.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The exclusion of tertiary print literature was due to technical difficulties when conducting the web-based survey. However, electronic information sources are frequently used among pharmacists nowadays, especially for the verification of health-related claims.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The rating scheme was not validated before the survey was conducted; hence extensive pretests and pilot tests were performed.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Conclusions</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Community pharmacists struggled to find high-quality electronic self-medication–related information sources under everyday practice conditions in the web group. This is of great importance as self-medication recommendations or simply the verification of statements should not be based on information resources of questionable quality. The search results of the EVInews group met many of the predefined standard quality criteria. Taken together, the findings suggest that there is a need for customized information sources for pharmacists. Evidence-based information tools such as the EVInews database may help in reducing the evidence-to-practice gap.</p>\n",

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Background: </span>To ensure the timely diagnosis of emerging infectious diseases, high-tech molecular biotechnology is often used to detect pathogens and has gradually become the gold standard for virological testing. However, beginners and students are often unable to practice their skills due to the higher costs associated with high-level virological testing, the increasing complexity of the equipment, and the limited number of specimens from patients. Therefore, a new training program is necessary to increase training and reduce the risk of test failure.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>The aim of the study is to (1) develop and implement a virtual reality (VR) software for simulated and interactive high-level virological testing that can be applied in clinical practice and skills building or training settings and (2) evaluate the VR simulation’s effectiveness on reaction, learning, and behavior of the students (trainees).<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>Viral nucleic acid tests on a BD MAX instrument were selected for our VR project because it is a high-tech automatic detection system. There was cooperation between teachers of medical technology and biomedical engineering. Medical technology teachers were responsible for designing the lesson plan, and the biomedical engineering personnel developed the VR software. We designed a novel VR teaching software to simulate cognitive learning via various procedure scenarios and interactive models. The VR software contains 2D VR “cognitive test and learning” lessons and 3D VR “practical skills training” lessons. We evaluated students’ learning effectiveness pre- and posttraining and then recorded their behavior patterns when answering questions, performing repeated exercises, and engaging in clinical practice.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>The results showed that the use of the VR software met participants’ needs and enhanced their interest in learning. The average posttraining scores of participants exposed to 2D and 3D VR training were significantly higher than participants who were exposed solely to traditional demonstration teaching (<i>P</i>&lt;.001). Behavioral assessments of students pre- and posttraining showed that students exposed to VR-based training to acquire relevant knowledge of advanced virological testing exhibited significantly improved knowledge of specific items posttraining (<i>P</i>&lt;.01). A higher participant score led to fewer attempts when responding to each item in a matching task. Thus, VR can enhance students’ understanding of difficult topics.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>The VR program designed for this study can reduce the costs associated with virological testing training, thus, increasing their accessibility for students and beginners. It can also reduce the risk of viral infections particularly during disease outbreaks (eg, the COVID-19 pandemic) and also enhance students’ learning motivation to strengthen their practical skills.<br></p>\n",

       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Introduction\" data-label=\"Introduction\">Introduction</h3>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Several outbreaks of infectious viral diseases with high fatality rates have occurred over the last 20 years: COVID-19 (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus), the new avian influenza virus (ie, H7N9), and the respiratory syncytial virus. These have all caused high hospitalization rates [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref4\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></span>]. Immunocompromised patients are vulnerable to severe diseases caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and herpes zoster virus infections [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref5\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref8\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></span>]. Thus, a timely diagnosis is necessary for clinicians to determine the optimal treatment plan. Accordingly, rapid diagnoses with high fidelity comprise an important requirement for clinical virology laboratories.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The use of high-tech molecular technology for the rapid detection of pathogens in clinical specimens has gradually become the gold standard for clinical virological testing [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref9\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref10\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></span>]. Furthermore, quantitative or qualitative test analysis is used as an important indicator for medical diagnosis, treatment tracking, risk assessment, and health care information.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Molecular techniques are an important tool for clinical testing; however, the cost of molecular test reagents is high. Further, special and repetitive training is required to operate the testing equipment; consequently, clinical virology laboratories frequently prevent medical technology (MT) interns from practicing these procedures on their equipment. There are similar problems in teaching in other specialized areas involving clinical medical skills. For example, surgical training has always relied heavily on practical operations to ensure that physicians acquire the necessary technical proficiency to perform surgical procedures. After observing surgical procedures and animal experiments demonstrated by the teacher, intern surgeons practice the relevant technical skills while being supervised by the teacher. This teaching method may be limited by various factors, including medical ethics, working hours, and medical disputes. Therefore, scholars in the field of surgical teaching have recently developed simulation tools to teach residents to perform surgery. Virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality or tactile computer programs can simulate the surgical environment for teaching purposes and apply minimally invasive surgical robots [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref11\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref12\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Traditional teaching methods transmit medical knowledge via lectures and textbooks. However, many teachers have recently begun to introduce 2-way communication learning methods such as problem-based learning and flipped education. These methods aim to replace the prevalent unidirectional cramming teaching method by transforming students from passive to active agents; this can improve their learning effectiveness [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref13\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref17\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></span>]. Although each specialized field has its own special required skills and methods, clinical practice courses play a pivotal role in medical technologists’ development. Students must hone their practical skills to reduce their chance of failure in real-world settings. Therefore, the depth and breadth of students’ clinical training and whether they can actually engage in operational exercises will affect their learning.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The fully automatized BD MAX system developed by Beckton Dickinson Company integrates 2 functions: fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection and nucleic acid extraction. This detection system has 24 independent PCR heating elements, 5 different fluorescence channels, and can run different programs simultaneously. It processes 96-120 samples in 8 hours. It also has high efficiency for the detection of pathogens.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The BD MAX system is used in modern clinical virology laboratories for the detection of multiple clinical microbial nucleic acids present in emergent infectious pathogens. Although the BD MAX is powerful, the cost of reagents is high. Thus, clinical virology laboratories often prevent MT interns from practicing with their equipment. Schools often have scarce funds to obtain such advanced and expensive equipment for students to learn. Further, even if the students manage to understand the principles of the procedure after analyzing the operation manual and observing the workflow of a well-trained medical technologist, they often cannot access appropriate practical training. Therefore, it is critical to develop new teaching methods that allow MT students to put their skills into practice so that those who do not have the opportunity to engage in real-world practice with this specialized technology can still receive training.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">VR comprises a virtual environment that is similar to reality. Computer technology can simulate a high-fidelity space and allow users to immerse themselves inside that environment. In a VR environment, users wear a special display device (ie, VR headsets) to enter the simulation. In this space, the operator can use a controller or keyboard to interact with the virtual environment. Importantly, VR does not aim to replace real space. By combining a camera’s recognition technology and a computer program, a set picture appears in the lens, and the corresponding virtual objects appear. However, high-tech VR products have not yet been developed and used in the field of skill training for virological testing. Thus, this study designed and implemented a VR software to train MT students to use a high-level virological testing system (ie, BD MAX) and evaluated students’ learning effectiveness.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Methods\" data-label=\"Methods\">Methods</h3>\n",
       "<h4>VR System Description</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The proposed study was developed based on Oculus Rift and cross-platform Unity. Oculus Rift is a VR goggle developed and manufactured by Oculus VR. The Rift has 2 PenTile organic light–emitting diode displays and offers 1080×1200 resolution per eye, a 90-Hz refresh rate, and a 110-degree field of view. The device also features rotational and positional tracking as well as integrated headphones that provide a 3D audio effect. The separation of the lenses is adjustable using a slider on the bottom of the device to accommodate a wide range of interpupillary distances. The Rift allows for full 6-degrees-of-freedom rotational and positional tracking. Tracking is performed by Oculus’s Con.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Creating Course Features</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">We designed several virtual clinical and experimental scenarios for students to develop the relevant skills for virological testing in a realistic setting. By using VR, students can develop practical skills by engaging with interactive content, without being limited to merely reading about standard operating procedures.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Study Population</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Senior-year students from the Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology (ie, MT students) at the College of Medicine of National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) in Tainan, Taiwan enrolled in the Clinical Virology Internship Course. Of these, 31 MT students participated in a 2D VR cognitive test and a 3D VR practical simulation.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Cooperation Between the MT and Biomedical Engineering Groups in the Study</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The teachers of the MT department at NCKU were responsible for designing the lesson plan and questionnaires, as well as evaluating students’ learning effectiveness. The department of biomedical engineering (BME) was responsible for the development of the VR software. The VR-based training was carried out in the VR classroom of the BME department. System operation was carried out in the clinical virology room of the Pathology Department at NCKU Hospital.</p>\n",
       "<h4>The Cross-Disciplinary MT and BME Team</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Since March 2019, we have discussed the subject of VR-based teaching plans as well as clinical virology teachers’ needs and feedback on the VR software described in this study. The BME group adjusted and optimized the VR software for high-level clinical virological testing after regular brainstorming and discussion. As of June 2022, there have been a total of 45 meetings.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Design of the High-Level Clinical Virological Testing Lessons</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The BD MAX instrument is an automatic virus nucleic acid detection system and was selected as the basis for our VR project. It is currently used to detect a variety of microorganisms (eg, HSV, varicella-zoster virus [VZV], and cytomegalovirus) at the NCKU Hospital’s clinical virology laboratory.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The self-developed VR teaching software had both a test mode and a learning mode. The computer software registered students’ score and immediately provided them with detailed feedback on the results. Combined with the test items (which assessed students’ knowledge regarding HSV and VZV PCR), a series of matching tasks was designed to prepare learners to interact with the VR environment. The difficulty level of the items was measured by the frequency of drag-and-drops (the term “drag” refers to the behavior of sliding the button to the answer before actually selecting the answer in the VR scenario) when students attempted to answer a given item. There were 10 items designed on the usage of BD MAX. The user activity diagram of the proposed research is shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure1\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 1</a></span>, and the detailed flowchart of each mode is shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure2\" rel=\"footnote\">Figures 2</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure6\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></span>. The user manual is shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app1\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 1</a></span>. Items 1-10 are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure7\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 7</a></span>, and the picture of VR scenario is shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure8\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 8</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The virology (MT) group provided a video of the actual operation process using the BD MAX system (while detailing each used component) to the BME team to create a high-fidelity 3D VR component. We recorded the virological testing process or an introduction to the structure of the automatic testing system. We also used computer software to divide the procedure’s steps on BD MAX and performed the procedures. We disassembled the steps of the practical procedure, and the design internship students could control the 3D objects to simulate the experimental process through the human-machine interface. The learners performed the entire practice process in a virtual learning setting. In the VR environment, there was a setting to prompt the learner to proceed to the next step so they could simulate the actual testing procedure. The interactive mode included using the hands in the VR simulation to place the objects in the correct position: a special color was displayed if the order was correct. A warning was displayed if the order or position was wrong—students were instructed to try again until they were correct. Real scenarios are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure9\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 9</a></span>A and <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure10\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 10</a></span>A. 3D VR scenarios are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure9\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 9</a></span>B and <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure10\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 10</a></span>B.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">After all the virtual scenarios were tested, the VR classroom provided learners with a virtual space for learning and interaction.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Our research team used the concept of software reliability to test the VR software’s stability. First, we developed a test plan to analyze each functional requirement, the expected trigger function, and whether the results were correct. The failure status of the software was defined according to 3 levels (high, medium, and low). Reliability coverage testing was subsequently performed. Coverage tests were conducted for input domain behavior, input variables, and their combinations, as well as various usage functions. After the tests were completed, we wrote a test report based on the failure condition and its definition and then made the necessary corrections. Medium- and high-level risks were completely resolved before the VR software was presented to users for testing. The users were finally allowed to use the VR software.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Ethics Approval</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The Institutional Review Board of NCKU Hospital approved the study (B-ER-109-432). All of the students were informed about the aim and protocol of the study, and written informed consent was obtained from all of them.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Learning Effectiveness Evaluation</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The levels of the Kirkpatrick model were used to investigate reaction, learning, and behavior of the students (trainees). We designed questionnaires of VR application learning effectiveness evaluation for participants to fill out anonymously, including the “satisfaction of using different learning materials” (reaction level) and the “self-assessment questionnaire of participants’ knowledge application” (behavior level). The score of the item in the questionnaires was as follows: very disagree got 1 point, disagree got 2 points, no comment got 3 points, agree got 4 points, and very agree got 5 points. Questionnaires of behavior level were conducted during pre- and posttraining. We also used 10 items of “cognitive test and learning” lessons (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure7\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 7</a></span>) for written tests with registered identification number to evaluate learning level of students’ background knowledge of HSV or VZV and the operations of BD MAX. The score of each item was as follows: 11 points in item 1, 16 points in item 2, 7 points in item 3, 6 points in item 4, 3 points in item 5, 3 points in item 6, 6 points in item 7, 1 point in item 8, 6 points in item 9, and 6 points in item 10. A total score of 10 items was 65 points and was adjusted to 100 points afterward. These 10 items of written tests were tested at pretraining, posttraining after traditional demonstration teaching, and posttraining after VR teaching.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Statistical Analysis</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">SPSS for Windows (version 17.0; SPSS Inc) and SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) was used for statistical analysis. Quantitative data of “satisfaction of using different learning materials” (reaction level) are presented as mean values with 95% CI. We used nonparametric methods to analyze nonnormal distribution data in this study. Comparisons of pretraining, posttraining after demonstration teaching, and posttraining after VR teaching were scored via written tests and analyzed via Friedman’s test with posthoc analysis, that is, the Dunn-Bonferroni test. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to analyze the differences in the “self-assessment questionnaire of participants’ knowledge application” on pretraining and posttraining; the Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons adjustment.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Results\" data-label=\"Results\">Results</h3>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">From August 2021 to January 2022, 31 students from the Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology at NCKU in Taiwan used the novel self-developed VR software for 2D VR cognitive testing and 3D VR practical training for BD MAX. In total, 3 of them did not fill out the self-assessment questionnaire for behavior application.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Kirkpatrick Level I (Reaction): Evaluating Trainees’ Satisfaction</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">We designed 4 questionnaires to evaluate trainees’ satisfaction and identify their interest in learning. Assessments of the VR teaching material, the design fluency of the VR content, and the improvement in participants’ professional ability were included in the content. The contents of the items are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table1\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 1</a></span>. The students’ feedback showed that the use of 2D+3D VR teaching materials met students’ needs and enhanced their interest in learning. The item “VR-based teaching materials can increase my interest in learning” exhibited the highest scores in posttraining satisfaction. The results of posttraining satisfaction are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table1\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 1</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p><sup>a</sup>VR: virtual reality.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Kirkpatrick Level II (Learning): Determining the Trainees’ Learning Attainment</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">We designed 10 items (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure7\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 7</a></span>) to assess students’ background knowledge of HSV or VZV and the operations of BD MAX. There were included in the written tests and 2D VR teaching scenarios. The 3D VR teaching scenarios of the workflow of BD MAX procedures were developed. Written tests assessed students’ knowledge at pretraining, posttraining after exposure to traditional demonstration teaching, and posttraining after exposure to 2D+3D VR teaching. In the analysis of the learning hierarchy, it was found that the average score of 2D+3D VR teaching posttraining was higher than that for traditional demonstration teaching, and the learning effect was significantly better. The data are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure11\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 11</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Kirkpatrick Level III (Behavior): Assessing Trainee’s Knowledge Application</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">We designed 5 questionnaires to assess trainees’ knowledge application. The dimensions assessed included interpretation of the results and quality control; familiarity with the BD MAX procedure; understanding the principles, structure, and function of the BD MAX instrument; familiarity with the examination types, containers, transport, and storage conditions; and understanding virological testing’s clinical significance and possessing pertinent background knowledge. The results of participants’ self-assessment pre- and posttraining showed that trainees exposed to VR training to learn about high-level virological testing (using BD MAX) had significantly improved their detailed knowledge posttraining, vis-à-vis pretraining (<i>P</i>&lt;.001). The data are shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure12\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 12</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<h4>The 2D Cognitive Software Analyzed the Number of Attempts Before the Correct Answer</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Our team designed a function of the 2D VR teaching software to record the “drags” (ie, attempts) for each item. The drags for each question were recorded and analyzed. The results showed that the higher the interns’ average score, the fewer drags they exhibited. We used this function to assess items’ difficulty level and used it as a reference for adjusting each lesson’s items (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure13\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 13</a></span>).</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Discussion\" data-label=\"Discussion\">Discussion</h3>\n",
       "<h4>Main Findings</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The use of VR software for teaching has become more popular in clinical medicine. Here, we designed and implemented a VR software for advanced MT training. The participants’ posttraining learning scores increased significantly after being exposed to 2D and 3D VR training. Participants exhibited significantly improved cognition of high-level virological testing posttraining. We analyzed the difficulty of the items and used it as a reference for adjusting them. Participants exposed to VR-based training considered that the VR-based teaching materials met their needs and enhanced their interest in learning.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Developing practical skills is paramount in the field of MT. MT students’ skill-development process begins in the basic experimental courses of natural science during their freshman and sophomore years and continues in the advanced experimental courses related to clinical testing in their junior year as well as the clinical courses in their senior year. MT interns perform more experimental operations than other departments in the medical field. The basic experimental practices performed in school differ significantly from clinical practice courses. In school, the designed laboratory course comprises relatively simple experiments for the students, considering the availability of equipment and resources. However, in the clinical virology practice course of the hospital, additional factors come into play, including the urgency of clinical work, the timeliness and accuracy of reports, the expensive cost of reagents, the complexity of instruments, and the limited number of specimens from patients. Therefore, MT beginners and students rarely have the opportunity to practice in real-world settings.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Due to the rapid development of molecular methodologies, the time required to detect viruses decreased significantly, from several days to 4-6 hours. Current detection procedures can detect multiple pathogens simultaneously, thus, becoming an invaluable tool for the clinical diagnosis of pathogenic infections [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref9\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref10\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref18\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref21\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></span>]. However, the test reagents required to detect multiple pathogens simultaneously are expensive (the cost of 1 test is about US $30), and the costs associated with the equipment are also high. The personnel require specialized training to operate the test instrument. Therefore, it is not possible for medical technological interns to practice in hospitals’ clinical virology laboratories. However, schools are also limited by the lack of proper funding, which makes it difficult for them to obtain advanced and expensive instrument for students to practice. Therefore, many intern students are limited to learning from the operation manuals and observing the operation of well-trained medical examiners. Therefore, it is important to use computer technology to develop new teaching methods that allow MT students who do not have access to this specialized technology to receive adequate training.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Mikropoulos et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref22\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></span>] investigated students’ views on VR learning and found that students generally held positive views regarding the use of VR in teaching while also verifying that VR can capture and maintain students’ attention. Many students expressed that it was exciting to be able to walk in and interact with the 3D VR world. VR simulation allows one to walk inside a molecule to study it in detail or, in the case of a block model, we can acquire a global perspective of a given city block at a distance. This allows the learner to develop a better understanding of the connections between the buildings, open space, and streets. Thus, VR will undoubtedly change the way we look at things and could even allow us to discover things that were previously unimaginable. It could also help people with disabilities break through their physical limitations and engage more actively in learning with their peers.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Of course, not all situations are suitable for the use of VR for education. Pantelidis [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref23\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></span>] established the following recommendations regarding the appropriate use of VR: (1) VR would be useful when using real objects is dangerous, impossible, or inconvenient; (2) virtual environments can be taught and trained in the same way as real objects; and (3) interacting with a model is as fun as interacting with the real thing.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Under the conditions of these 3 points, it is recommended to use VR for teaching in clinical virology laboratories. This research project was consistent with all 3 aspects. The BD MAX reagents are expensive, and the number of specimens is limited; thus, it is inconvenient to use a real BD MAX for learning. Other instruments required for PCR molecular detection can be similar to the real object. For interns, working with VR itself is a fun and fresh experience. Therefore, this research project was suitable for simulation using VR. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref24\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></span>] launched a VR teaching video: Biosafety Cabinet Edition in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">In addition to the simulated surgical training, VR technology has also been used in baby breathing training, emergency simulation training, dental education, stroke rehabilitation, dental dexterity training, pharmacy teaching, pain management, web-based weight control training, and other clinical applications in the field of medicine and medical care [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref25\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref36\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></span>]. Although all VR devices have similar structures, there are slight differences in hardware and software requirements in different fields as well as different application modes [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref37\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref39\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></span>]. For example, the VR simulation training device for teaching mainly focuses on the use of a 3D or 360-degree environment and network resources, whereas simulations for surgery focus on the interaction between the operator’s instruments and the living anatomy. The environmental design simulations mainly consider the patient’s emotional control and feedback [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref40\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref42\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Here, 2D cognitive software and 3D practical VR software of BD MAX lessons were developed. MT interns can use this system to familiarize themselves with the use of virological testing equipment and assess their learning. The results showed that the use of the VR software met the students’ needs and enhanced their interest in learning. In addition, scores from written tests after VR training (posttraining) were significantly higher than after traditional demonstration teaching (posttraining) in the learning level. The behavioral assessment of students pre- and posttraining showed that students exposed to VR training had significantly improved virological knowledge.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Limitations</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The appropriateness of the selection of teaching scripts may have affected the breadth and validity of the use of the teaching software. The fidelity of the 3D elements’ object art and production during VR scenarios requires professional art experts and additional funding support. Due to the limited number of students, this study only has 1 arm and uses a pre- and postcomparison design. Future work will use a randomized 2-arm design to better understand the impact of the technology.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Conclusions</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first self-developed VR software for high-tech virological testing training. This valuable tool increased MT students’ learning effectiveness. This not only provides beginners and students with the opportunity to operate BD MAX but also saves laboratory and educational costs, thus, enhancing their learning motivation and practical skills. It can also reduce the risk of viral infections particularly during transmitted disease outbreaks. Although VR cannot replace real human interactions, it does have many advantages, such as the freedom to modify, move, and place objects in the virtual world. Its free access is not restricted by time, and it can reduce certain risks. Thus, VR is a valuable teaching tool.</p>\n",

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Background: </span>Testicular sperm extraction (TESE) is an essential therapeutic tool for the management of male infertility. However, it is an invasive procedure with a success rate up to 50%. To date, no model based on clinical and laboratory parameters is sufficiently powerful to accurately predict the success of sperm retrieval in TESE.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>The aim of this study is to compare a wide range of predictive models under similar conditions for TESE outcomes in patients with nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) to identify the correct mathematical approach to apply, most appropriate study size, and relevance of the input biomarkers.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>We analyzed 201 patients who underwent TESE at Tenon Hospital (Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Sorbonne University, Paris), distributed in a retrospective training cohort of 175 patients (January 2012 to April 2021) and a prospective testing cohort (May 2021 to December 2021) of 26 patients. Preoperative data (according to the French standard exploration of male infertility, 16 variables) including urogenital history, hormonal data, genetic data, and TESE outcomes (representing the target variable) were collected. A TESE was considered positive if we obtained sufficient spermatozoa for intracytoplasmic sperm injection. After preprocessing the raw data, 8 machine learning (ML) models were trained and optimized on the retrospective training cohort data set: The hyperparameter tuning was performed by random search. Finally, the prospective testing cohort data set was used for the model evaluation. The metrics used to evaluate and compare the models were the following: sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), and accuracy. The importance of each variable in the model was assessed using the permutation feature importance technique, and the optimal number of patients to include in the study was assessed using the learning curve.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>The ensemble models, based on decision trees, showed the best performance, especially the random forest model, which yielded the following results: AUC=0.90, sensitivity=100%, and specificity=69.2%. Furthermore, a study size of 120 patients seemed sufficient to properly exploit the preoperative data in the modeling process, since increasing the number of patients beyond 120 during model training did not bring any performance improvement. Furthermore, inhibin B and a history of varicoceles exhibited the highest predictive capacity.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>An ML algorithm based on an appropriate approach can predict successful sperm retrieval in men with NOA undergoing TESE, with promising performance. However, although this study is consistent with the first step of this process, a subsequent formal prospective multicentric validation study should be undertaken before any clinical applications. As future work, we consider the use of recent and clinically relevant data sets (including seminal plasma biomarkers, especially noncoding RNAs, as markers of residual spermatogenesis in NOA patients) to improve our results even more.<br></p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"h3-main-heading\" id=\"Keywords\">Keywords</h3>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Introduction\" data-label=\"Introduction\">Introduction</h3>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">In the context of azoospermia, testicular sperm extraction (TESE) can be proposed to obtain mature germ cells (ie, spermatozoa) for in vitro fertilization with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref3\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></span>]. Several surgical techniques are available for this, including conventional surgical TESE (cTESE) and microsurgical TESE (microTESE), the latter of which requires the use of an operating microscope to visualize the seminiferous tubules that are most likely to contain complete spermatogenesis [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref4\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></span>]. However, both of these are invasive procedures and are, thus far, not exempt from complications such as hematoma, infection, vascular damage, and testosterone deficiency [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref4\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></span>]. Thus, TESE must be proposed after a couple’s complete infertility checkup and information session as well as following a multidisciplinary discussion. Finally, spermatozoa can be retrieved from testicular tissue in only about 50% of cases [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref5\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref6\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Some teams have aimed to identify the most predictive factors of a positive TESE, first using univariate models, followed by multivariate models and, finally, artificial intelligence, including machine learning (ML) models [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref7\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></span>]. We conducted a scoping review on the prediction of TESE success, extended to relevant citations on PubMed (MeSH terms: TESE; prediction; non-obstructive azoospermia; machine learning; sperm). A combination of search terms and Boolean operators (such as OR, AND) were used as appropriate to broaden the search and retrieve all relevant papers.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Among the clinical and hormonal variables in a preoperative assessment, age, BMI, total testosterone, and prolactin levels seem insufficiently predictive of the presence of spermatozoa in testicular tissue [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref8\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref13\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></span>], while small testicular volume [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref14\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref17\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></span>]; high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref18\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></span>]; and low inhibin B, reflecting impaired testicular function, are generally accompanied by a lower probability of successful TESE [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref19\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref22\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></span>]. In addition, abnormal karyotype and microdeletion in the azoospermia factor (AZF) region are found in 6% to 18% of patients with azoospermia [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref23\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref26\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></span>]. Except for complete AZFa and AZFb mutations, which are systematically associated with an absence of complete spermatogenesis, genetic results are insufficient predictors of TESE outcomes [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref26\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></span>]. Finally, a history of cryptorchidism and smoking status have shown inconsistent results [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref27\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref29\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></span>]. Consequently, separately, none of these predictors has so far shown satisfactory, sufficient, and reproducible predictive performance to guide practitioners regarding the probability of TESE success and the evaluation of the benefit-risk balance [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref7\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref14\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref30\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref33\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></span>]. In addition, this surgery involves a substantial cost for some patients.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">ML techniques allow for predictions based on the integration of a large amount of data due to an increase in computing power. We previously reported the relevance of mathematical modeling and ML approaches [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref34\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref35\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></span>]. Concerning TESE, different models were developed with conventional clinical and biological data from the preoperative checkup. Mostly, the models developed were logistic regression (LR) or artificial neural network (ANN) models. For instance, Tsujimura et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref36\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></span>] developed an LR using 100 patients and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83. Notwithstanding the use of a larger cohort of more than 1000 patients, the LR model from Cissen et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref37\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></span>] achieved an AUC of only 0.65. Furthermore, the ANN model that Ramasamy et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref38\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></span>] used yielded even poorer performance, with an AUC of 0.59. Finally, Zeadna et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref39\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></span>] developed a more complex ensemble model based on decision trees (XGBoost [XGB]), which exhibited a sensitivity of over 90% but a very low specificity (51%).</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Nevertheless, these studies applied different approaches and used various sample sizes, making it difficult to compare them and establish the correct mathematical methodology.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">As it is challenging to determine which mathematical approach and, thus, which type of ML model will be the most appropriate and effective, an extensive search of the most common models is essential to avoid model selection bias. Similarly, the number of patients needed to obtain a successful model is mostly empirical and depends on the problem and type of data made available.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop, evaluate, and compare a wide range of predictive models under similar conditions for TESE outcomes in patients with nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) to identify the correct mathematical approach to apply thereto, as well as the most appropriate study size. To our knowledge, our study is the first intermethodology comparative study in this field, as well as the first to assess the requisite sample size.</p>\n",

       "<h4>Description of the Patients</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Data from 201 patients who underwent TESE (cTESE or microTESE) between January 2012 and December 2021 at Tenon Hospital (Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Sorbonne University, Paris) were collected. All included patients presented with NOA, which is defined as the absence of spermatozoa in the semen in at least two collections at least three months apart (2010 World Health Organization criteria for semen analysis) [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref40\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></span>]. Patients with NOA following radiotherapy or with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism were excluded from the study.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Surgical Procedure</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The surgical procedure was systematically performed under general anesthesia. After the scrototomy and opening of the tunica vaginalis, the albuginea was incised. The testicular pulp was then expressed and dissected (cTESE: 136/201, 67.7%). In some cases, the dissection of testicular tissue was done under a surgical microscope to better locate the seminiferous tubules that most likely contain sperm (microTESE: 65/201, 32.3%). Fragments could be taken bilaterally (from both testicles) or unilaterally at the upper, middle, and lower pole of each testicle, sparing the rete testis area. One sample was systematically collected to send it for anatomopathology. Once collected, the testicular fragments were transported in a culture medium (Ferticult Hepes) to the laboratory. The testicular fragments were then prepared using mechanical methods and observed under optical microscopy for the spermatozoon search [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref40\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<h4>Study Overview</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">In the first step, preoperative data including urogenital history, hormonal data, genetic data, and TESE outcomes (representing the target variable) were collected from patients’ medical records, including management software and paper records (patients in the retrospective training cohort: 175/201, 87.1%; patients in the prospective testing cohort: 26/201, 12.9%). This data collection was driven by the potentially relevant predictors identified from the literature and expert recommendations regarding evaluation of male infertility [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref6\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref41\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref42\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></span>]. In the second step, raw data were preprocessed (eg, imputation of missing values, encoding [eg, turning qualitative variable into numbers], and scaling [eg, transforming quantitative variable when they were on a different scale]) to transform them into a format suitable for the ML models. Once these data were preprocessed, 8 ML and deep learning (DL) models were trained and selected using the retrospective training cohort data in the third step. Finally, in the 4th and last step, data from the prospective training cohort were used to evaluate the models (temporal validation) and allow for comparison using the prospective test set from patients the models had never seen. The results from the test set give a good indication of how the model should perform in the real world (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure1\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 1</a></span>).</p>\n",
       "<h4>Data Set</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The input data corresponded with the French standard exploration of male infertility and the TESE preoperative assessment [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref6\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></span>]. Among the 16 included variables, 7 were quantitative, and 9 were qualitative or categorical. The variables were age, BMI, tobacco consumption, hormonal assessment (FSH, luteinizing hormone [LH], testosterone, inhibin B, and prolactin), genetic exploration (karyotype and search for Y-chromosome microdeletion), and urogenital history (cryptorchidism, infection, trauma, gonadotoxic therapy, urogenital surgery, and varicoceles), for a total of 16 variables.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The outcome was the presence (y=1) or absence (y=0) of spermatozoa after examination of the surgical specimens. A TESE was considered positive when we obtained enough spermatozoa for the ICSI procedure.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Statistical Analysis</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Prior to the modeling process, exploratory analysis of the data was conducted to quantify missing data and analyze the variables’ distributions. Correlations and mean comparisons were also performed. Regarding the statistics, the qualitative variables are reported as percentages, and the quantitative variables are reported as medians (IQRs). We used the Mann-Whitney test for quantitative variables (among the quantitative variables, none was normally distributed [Shapiro-Wilk]) and χ<sup>2</sup> for qualitative variables. For correlations, the Pearson coefficient was used. A <i>P</i> value of &lt;.05 was considered significant.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Preprocessing and Modeling</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Our main objective was to train a classification model to classify a new patient as presenting with either an “absence of sperm” or “presence of sperm” during TESE based on the patient’s variables. After processing the raw data (eg, handling missing data, management of categorical or qualitative variables, standardization), many different models (n=8) were trained, optimized, and evaluated. ML models (Bayesian naive classification, LR, k-nearest neighbor classifier, support vector machine [SVM], random forest [RF], gradient-boosted tree [GBT], and XGB) and DL models using several neural network architectures were also tested. The optimization and fine-tuning of the hyperparameters were performed using a cross-validation random search technique on each split of the training set: Each hyperparameter was sampled from a distribution of possible parameter values. The highest performing hyperparameter combination was used for each model [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref43\" rel=\"footnote\">43</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<h4>The Validation and Evaluation Procedure</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The data set (patient cohort) was distributed into a training set for training, during which hyperparameters were set and models were selected (internal validation, repeated 5-fold cross-validation [10 iterations]), and a separate test set, during which a final evaluation of patients that the models had never seen (external validation) was conducted. The external validation consisted of testing the models’ ability to classify or correctly predict the patients of the test cohort. Both sets came from the same institution, but the patients’ data were collected at separate periods. In a monocentric study, splitting by time and developing a model using data from one period and evaluating its performance using the data from the other period (temporal validation) is a stronger approach, as indicated by the “Transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis” (TRIPOD) Statement [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref44\" rel=\"footnote\">44</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The following several classification metrics were used to evaluate the models and compare them objectively: sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), and accuracy. Moreover, as a binary classification task, the thresholds for both ML and deep learning models were maintained at 50%. For example, a TESE was classified as positive when the probability of success was greater than 50% and negative when the probability was less than 50%. Finally, the following 2 additional factors were considered when evaluating the models: importance of each variable in the model and optimal number of patients to include in the study. The importance of each variable in the models was determined using the permutation technique: Permutation feature importance (PFE) consists of comparing the performances of the model with and without the variable under evaluation [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref45\" rel=\"footnote\">45</a></span>]. PFE generates an ordered list of variables along with their importance values. Interpreting the output of this algorithm is straightforward‎: Variables ranked higher have more impact on the model predictions. Identifying relevant variables is also useful for the model’s explainability. For the optimal number of patients, we used the learning curve, which is a graphical representation of the relationship between the model’s performance (measured on the vertical axis) and the number of patients used for training (measured on the horizontal axis). A learning curve allows for visually evaluating the evolution of the model’s performance as new patients are included. The shape of this learning curve (plateau or rising slope) provides information on the number of patients needed to obtain good performance and discern whether it is necessary to include new patients.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Computer Tools</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The whole project was realized exclusively with the Python 3.8 programming language and several libraries: NumPy 1.20.3 and Pandas 1.2.4 for data table management and matrix calculation, SciPy 1.7.0 and Pingouin 0.3.12 for statistics, and Sklearn 0.24.2 and TensorFlow 2.5.0 for modeling [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref46\" rel=\"footnote\">46</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref50\" rel=\"footnote\">50</a></span>].

       "<h4>Ethical Considerations</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The local ethics committee “Comité d’Éthique de la Recherche, Sorbonne Université” (CER@SU) approved this study under protocol number CER-2021-041, and this study had no external source of funding.</p>\n",

All the variables from the preoperative assessment were included, with missing data in the training cohort ranging from 5.7% (10/175) to 57.7% (101/175) for varicocele and prolactin, respectively. No missing data were reported in the test cohort. Within the training set (n=175), enough spermatozoa for the ICSI procedure were found in the testicular tissue of 104 (59.4%) patients (positive TESE), while the TESE was negative in the 71 (40.6%) remaining patients. Within the test set, the distribution between the classes was equal. The following 3 variables were significantly different between the 2 groups: FSH, LH, and inhibin B levels (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table1\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 1</a></span>). In addition, in the training set, several quantitative variables were significantly correlated: FSH and inhibin B (<i>r</i>=−0.637; <i>P</i>&lt;.001), LH and inhibin B (<i>r</i>=−0.454; <i>P</i>&lt;.001), LH and testosterone (<i>r</i>=−0.194; <i>P</i>=.03), age and LH (<i>r</i>=−0.186; <i>P</i>=.04), FSH and total testosterone (<i>r</i>=−0.176; <i>P</i>=.04), age and inhibin B (<i>r</i>=0.222; <i>P</i>=.04), and FSH and LH (<i>r</i>=0.852; <i>P</i>&lt;.001).</p>\n",

       "<h4>The Valuation Procedure and Cohort Splitting</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Both cohorts (training and test sets) were from the same institution, and patients were managed in a similar manner. A retrospective cohort of 175 patients was first used for model building. Following this first step of the study, a prospective collection of data of patients undergoing TESE in the institution was conducted. This second temporal test cohort, consisting of prospectively collected data from May 2021 to December 2021, served to independently evaluate the performance of the models. Moreover, the prospective data collection allowed the inclusion of only “complete” patients’ TESE preoperative assessments, resulting in no missing values for this temporal test cohort. The distribution between classes of 1/0 (positive/negative) was 104/71 in the training set and 13/13 in the test set. Further, the characteristics (variables) of the patients were not significantly different between the 2 cohorts (training and test).</p>\n",
       "<h4>Performance of the Tested Models</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\"><span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table2\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 2</a></span> reports the internal and external validation results for the different models: The ensemble models based on decision trees (RF and GBT) showed the best performance. Additionally, the DL models were less efficient than the more classical ML models, especially in the test cohort. The highest performing hyperparameter combination for each model is reported in Table S1 in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app1\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 1</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p><sup>a</sup>AUC-ROC: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.</p>\n",
       "<p><sup>b</sup>LR: logistic regression.</p>\n",
       "<p><sup>c</sup>BNC: Bayesian naive classification.</p>\n",
       "<p><sup>d</sup>RF: random forest.</p>\n",
       "<p><sup>e</sup>GBT: gradient-boosted tree.</p>\n",
       "<p><sup>f</sup>XGB: XGBoost.</p>\n",
       "<p><sup>g</sup>SVM: support vector machine.</p>\n",
       "<p><sup>h</sup>KNN: k-nearest neighbor.</p>\n",
       "<p><sup>i</sup>ANN: artificial neural network.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Top Model, Biomarker Ranking, and Sample Size Requirements</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The most efficient model was the RF model. The RF model showed the best performance in the test cohort, with an AUC of 0.90, a sensitivity of 100%, and a specificity of 69.2%. Notably, the performances in the test cohort were better each time than during cross-validation in the training cohort. The RF model is an ensemble model (ie, it combines several models). For the RF model, the most discriminating variable (mean 26.6%, SD 2.5%) was serum inhibin B concentration (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure2\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 2</a></span>). In addition, serum prolactin concentration (mean 3.1%, SD 1.1%), patient age (mean 3.2%, SD 0.8%), and the presence of a history of varicoceles (whatever the grade; mean, 2.3%, SD 0.4%) also seemed to be important in discriminating between the 2 groups.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Despite a lower reliability of the analysis, given the weaker performance of the 6 other models tested, the importance of the variables was also determined for 6 models (see Table S2 in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app2\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 2</a></span>). These outputs were not available for neural networks (due to their black box appearance). Briefly, as shown in Table S2 in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app2\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 2</a></span>, for the 2 decision tree models (XGB and GBT), which are similar to the RF model, the discriminant variables were comparable to those observed for the RF model (including serum inhibin and prolactin concentrations). In contrast, for linear models (such as SVM and LR), additional variables such as FSH concentration, smoking, and the presence of genetic abnormalities (Y microdeletion and abnormal karyotype) appeared to be also stratifying. However, the interpretation of the ranking results of these latter models should be interpreted with caution, insofar as such variable combinations did not produce efficient models.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The performance of the RF model increased to a plateau at around 120 patients (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure3\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 3</a></span>). Beyond this number of patients used to train the model, increasing the number of patients did not bring any performance gain. Indeed, beyond this threshold, the inclusion of additional patients did not allow for any increase in performance. These findings are similar for the other models evaluated: indeed, the learning curves also reached a plateau after 120 patients, showing the limitation of their performance despite the increase in the amount of data (see <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app3\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 3</a></span>). However, these results should be interpreted carefully, considering the poor relevance and performance of these models.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Discussion\" data-label=\"Discussion\">Discussion</h3>\n",
       "<h4>Overview</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">We aimed to develop and evaluate predictive models of TESE outcomes in patients with NOA using ML methods and integrating retrospective data from the preoperative assessment. To our knowledge, this study was the first to compare several methodologies under the same conditions with the aim of determining the correct mathematical approach to apply and the most appropriate study size. TESE is an essential therapeutic tool for the management of male infertility and is often the “last hope” before gamete donation for these patients, but it is an invasive procedure. Consequently, it is essential to have a decision tool that could help the surgeon to decide whether this invasive procedure is the best option for the patient.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Best Mathematical Approach to Apply and Best Sample Size to Use</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Heterogeneity in the methodology and sample sizes in previous studies was the main obstacle to determining the correct mathematical approach to apply and the proper number of patients to include. In our study, the application of various approaches to the same cohort of patients allowed for an unbiased comparison. Regarding the different models investigated, the best results were provided by decision tree–based ensemble models, especially the RF model. Zeadna et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref39\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></span>], who used the GBT and XGB models, which are close to the RF model, also found interesting results. Linear models such as LR or Bayesian models performed less well and produced results close to those of Tsujimura et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref36\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></span>] and Cissen et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref37\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></span>]. Despite more recent developments in artificial intelligence and more sophisticated technology, the neural network–based DL models yielded poor results that were below those of more traditional or classical methods. This could have been because data from the preoperative assessment used as input were inappropriate or because neural networks are classically used to process less structured, complex, and larger sized data such as sound signals or images (computer vision) or text (natural language processing). Overall, nonlinear methods such as decision trees and related methods (particularly the RF model) seem to be the most appropriate approach to predict TESE success. Beyond the raw performance of the models, the main strength of this study was its comparison of many models under identical conditions: similar patients and a similar sampling strategy. On the other hand, 120 patients seemed to be enough to properly exploit the preoperative data during the modeling process.</p>\n",
       "<h4>The Relevance of Input Biomarkers</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The most relevant variables in the previous models described in the literature were somewhat heterogeneous; for example, hormonal parameters (eg, LH, FSH) were powerful in the LR used by Cissen et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref37\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></span>], while semen volume and ethnicity surprisingly appeared to be significant in the GBT used by Zeadna et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref39\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></span>]. PFE measures the predictive value of a feature by evaluating how the prediction error increases when a variable is not available. PFE is a global explanation method that provides insights into an ML model’s behavior. It estimates and ranks feature importance based on the impact each variable has on the trained ML model’s predictions. In our study, and using the RF model, the most discriminating variable was the serum inhibin B level. Inhibin B is a hormone produced by Sertoli cells and is directly correlated with spermatogenesis. This hormone is a relevant variable in patients with and without spermatozoa [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref52\" rel=\"footnote\">52</a></span>]. Moreover, albeit with no significant difference between the groups, prolactin did indeed negatively impact sperm production [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref53\" rel=\"footnote\">53</a></span>], and therefore, its contribution to the discriminative power of the model seems meaningful. Unfortunately, due to missing data, we could not demonstrate the discriminative contribution of prolactin levels. Finally, the presence of a history of varicoceles, which is characterized by the dilation of a vein in the spermatic cord and is frequently found in infertile men, also seemed to be important in discriminating patients with positive TESEs from those with negative TESEs. Despite the good performance of the RF, the true classification power of conventional preoperative assessment can be challenged to explain the results of TESE. Moreover, the preoperative data were chosen for their accessibility and availability for incorporation into the patient’s therapeutic management. The selection of these data brings up other more general discussion points. For example, the available preoperative data may not have been sufficient to characterize the phenomenon that makes a TESE positive or not. Consequently, other variables or innovative biomarkers, such as genetic, proteomic, lifestyle, and environmental data, could be considered for further investigation. In the future, the integration of new biomarkers could allow for the construction of more efficient models [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref54\" rel=\"footnote\">54</a></span>]. These include serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentration, which appears to be an interesting marker of intratesticular testosterone [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref55\" rel=\"footnote\">55</a></span>]. More specifically, biomarkers in seminal plasma may be of interest. Thus, the integration of seminal inhibin B and seminal antiMüllerian hormone into an LR model could allow for the better prediction of the outcome of TESE [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref56\" rel=\"footnote\">56</a></span>]. Moreover, small noncoding RNA are increasingly being studied, and their variation in seminal plasma could encourage new diagnostic perspectives. For instance, Fang et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref57\" rel=\"footnote\">57</a></span>] observed different miRNA profiles in the seminal plasma of men with positive or negative TESEs. Likewise, Xie et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref58\" rel=\"footnote\">58</a></span>] were interested in the predictive characteristics of extracellular vesicle long noncoding RNA in seminal plasma. Finally, Ji et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref59\" rel=\"footnote\">59</a></span>] recently highlighted the value of circRNA for the same purpose.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Limitations and Routine Usage of the Predictive Model</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Two limitations of the study are worth mentioning: its monocentric design and the use of 2 surgical procedures, namely cTESE and microTESE. Despite the monocentric design, the work was carried out in 2 periods: first, model building with retrospective data from patients undergoing TESE until June 2021. This modeling process highlighted the challenge of collecting retrospective data and promoted the initiation of a prospective collection of patients managed from that date onwards. Following several months of data collection (until December 2021), a prospective testing cohort was therefore used to objectively evaluate the performance of the models. One perspective for the future should be to keep going in this way, including new patients over time and incorporating them into the model, in order to refine the performance of the models through time. The target could also have been a limitation, as its results were variable. Indeed, the target may depend on the surgeon, surgical technique used, site of the biopsy, and presence of focal spermatogenesis that may vary according to the tissue heterogeneity of the testis [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref60\" rel=\"footnote\">60</a></span>]. This heterogeneous distribution of seminiferous tubules, making the result dependent on the skill and experience of the surgeon, can eventually lead to errors in patient labeling, which can be detrimental to building ML models. Furthermore, the development of the microTESE technique, with its seminiferous tube visualization step, may certainly reduce this variability and make the biopsy results more reproducible.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Despite these limitations, the RF model showed excellent performance and seemed to be the most appropriate modeling approach. Additionally, 120 patients seemed adequate as a study population to train and validate this model. A diagnostic tool with perfect performance would be difficult to obtain, so a model with an AUC of nearly than 90% and an excellent sensitivity would probably be suitable as an additional tool for the management of men presenting with azoospermia. It would, therefore, be necessary to confirm these results and improve the performance of the model in a prospective multicenter design study, for sufficient robustness.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Conclusions</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">ML models can provide the basis for an enhanced decision support system tool in the context of azoospermia, as they give additional and more relevant information than each variable taken separately. Nevertheless, many innovative AI models were tested, but none can determine TESE results with absolute certainty. However, we report promising results with decision tree–based ensemble models, and these require multicentric validation prior to any clinical use. It would, therefore, be interesting to improve the model, and several ways for improvement should be considered. Indefinitely increasing the number of participants and testing other DL models do not seem to be the most effective solutions. Integrating additional innovative biomarkers into the models may be necessary to improve the model’s performance. For example, biomarkers in seminal plasma may be of interest, as well as small noncoding RNA, which are increasingly being studied and whose variation in seminal plasma could encourage new diagnostic perspectives.</p>\n",

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of a novel theoretically driven internet-based intervention for first-year college students who identify as women (RealConsent) in reducing their risk of exposure to SV and alcohol misuse as well as increasing alcohol protective and bystander behaviors.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>This randomized controlled trial involved first-year college students who identified as women (n=881) attending 1 of 3 universities in the southeastern United States. Participants aged 18 to 20 years were randomized to RealConsent (444/881, 50.4%) or to an attention-matched placebo control (437/881, 49.6%). RealConsent is fully automated and consists of four 45-minute modules that incorporate entertainment-education media and proven behavior change techniques. The primary outcome was exposure to SV; the secondary outcomes were alcohol protective behaviors, dating risk behaviors, alcohol misuse, and bystander behavior. Study outcomes were assessed at baseline and 6-month follow-up.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>Among participants with some exposure to SV, those in the RealConsent group experienced less exposure to SV than the placebo group (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.33-0.69; <i>P</i>=.002). Furthermore, participants in the RealConsent group engaged in more alcohol protective behaviors (adjusted odds ratio 1.17, 95% CI 0.12-2.22; <i>P</i>=.03) and were less likely to binge drink (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.67-0.97; <i>P</i>=.003). Finally, participants in the RealConsent group who had 100% dosage were more likely to engage in bystander behavior than those with &lt;100% dosage plus placebo group (adjusted odds ratio 1.72, 95% CI 1.17-2.55; <i>P</i>=.006).<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>A comprehensive exposure to SV, alcohol use, and bystander educational program was successful in decreasing the occurrence of exposure to SV among those most at risk and in increasing alcohol protective behaviors.

       "<h4>Background</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Sexual violence (SV) is a widespread, complex social and behavioral problem for which we currently have few comprehensive approaches to prevention and even fewer for college women [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref4\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></span>]. SV encompasses a range of behaviors on a continuum from <i>minor</i> behaviors (eg, catcalling and verbal suggestions of intent to force someone to have sex) to more extreme behaviors (eg, attempted or completed rape). An estimated 1 in 5 women report having experienced attempted or completed rape in their lifetime, and 43.9% have experienced other forms of SV in their lifetime [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref5\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref6\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></span>]. Consequences of SV include posttraumatic stress disorder, suicidality, problematic alcohol use, and increased risk for re-exposure to SV [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref7\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref8\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></span>]. College campuses, in general, are high-risk environments for SV. In 2019, about 26% of college women experienced SV, which represents a 3% increase from 2015 [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref9\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref10\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></span>]. SV largely occurs during a woman’s freshman or sophomore year of college and most often (75%-80% of the time) at the hands of a known assailant [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref11\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></span>]. Alcohol use is also highly prevalent on college campuses: &gt;60% of US college students drink alcohol, and 35% engage in heavy episodic drinking (≥5 drinks for men and ≥4 drinks for women in 1 sitting) [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref12\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></span>]. It is not surprising then that alcohol is a key contributor to SV; 50% to 79% of SV incidents involve alcohol use by the SV survivor, perpetrator, or both [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref11\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref13\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref16\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></span>]. Despite decades of research, we have not moved the needle on campus SV [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref11\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref17\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref18\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Although numerous existing prevention programs focus on reducing perpetration rates among men or improving bystander behaviors, there is a need for programs that combine multiple, comprehensive prevention strategies [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref19\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref22\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></span>]. In addition, in the current intervention landscape, there is a lack of programs targeted specifically at educating and empowering women. Although the majority of programs do and <i>should focus</i> on identifying and preventing risk for perpetration of SV by men, there are actionable tools and skill sets that can equip women to advocate for themselves when entering the college landscape [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref20\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref23\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref25\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></span>]. Protective drinking behavior is a teachable skill set that has been identified as a protective factor for exposure to SV [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref26\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref31\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></span>]. Programs directed at women should also seek to reduce risk by increasing individual ability to perceive risk for exposure to SV, identify dangerous dating situations, enhance self-defense skills, and improve assertive communication skills. Although some programs do currently exist that address alcohol as a risk factor for SV and protective drinking behaviors [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref23\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref27\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref32\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></span>], there are no programs specifically designed for college women that include alcohol use as a central program component. Furthermore, most prevention programs for both men and women are delivered through in-person small group settings, which limits the scope of dissemination.</p>\n",
       "<h4>RealConsent (Women's Version)</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">RealConsent (women's version) was developed using web-based and mobile technologies and is an educational program aimed specifically at helping college-age women develop protective behaviors against SV. Building off the delivery model of the 2014 RealConsent program aimed at college-age men [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref33\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></span>], the women's version is meant to promote women’s abilities to understand and perceive risk for exposure to SV; help women to understand the dangers of, and protective behaviors for, alcohol consumption; and teach women how to leverage peer networks as bystanders able to intervene in dangerous situations. In this study, RealConsent was evaluated for efficacy in reducing SV incidence, affecting alcohol and dating risk and protective factors, reducing alcohol misuse, and increasing bystander behavior among college students who identified as women.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Methods\" data-label=\"Methods\">Methods</h3>\n",
       "<h4>Recruitment and Study Design</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A randomized controlled trial (RCT; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03726437) was implemented at 3 universities in the southeastern United States. Study procedures were approved by the primary investigator’s university institutional review board. Eligible participants were (1) those who self-identified as women, (2) aged 18 to 20 years, (3) single, and (4) entering their first year of college. The eligibility criteria reflect the high risk of exposure to SV among first-year college women as well as the specific period of elevated risk for exposure to SV, which is the fall semester, also known as the <i>red zone</i> [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref34\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<h4>Ethics Approval and Procedures</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">This study was approved by the Georgia State University institutional review board (H19033). Active recruitment began in October 2018 and ended in February 2019. We recruited a web-based sample of first-year college students who identified as women (n=881) using email contact lists provided by the registrar’s office of each university. An email was sent to potential participants containing a description of the study with a link to a web-based survey delivered via Qualtrics to complete an eligibility screener. If individuals met the eligibility criteria, they were then redirected to another web-based survey to complete the informed consent form and electronically provide their consent to participate. Potential participants were blinded to the study hypotheses and told that the purpose of the study was to “examine the effectiveness of a 3-hour web-based program for incoming female freshmen.”</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Once they provided informed consent, participants were asked to complete a web-based registration form, where they provided their contact information, including their full name, email address, residential address, and mobile phone number. Next, participants were redirected to the baseline survey assessment. Participants received US $30 for completing the baseline survey. Once participants completed the baseline survey, they were directed to a web-based survey that collected data on their email address and institution, which was then used to randomize participants to 1 of the 2 study conditions. Stratified block randomization was implemented via REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture; Vanderbilt University) to randomly assign participants to either RealConsent or to an attention-matched placebo condition called <i>Stress and Mood Management</i> [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref35\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></span>]. We encouraged participants to complete their assigned program within a week by offering them a US $10 incentive for completing a brief acceptability survey after each program module. Participants were also asked to complete a follow-up survey 6 months after completing the baseline survey, for which they received US $50. Weekly email and SMS text reminders were sent to participants to complete program modules and surveys.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Interventions</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The RealConsent program (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure1\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 1</a></span>) uses web-based and mobile technologies with the primary goal being to reduce the risk of exposure to SV among first-year college students who identify as women. RealConsent is grounded in the social cognitive theory (SCT) [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref36\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref37\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></span>]. The SCT describes the multiple reciprocal influences on health behaviors, including individual experiences, beliefs, and environmental factors. According to the SCT, “knowledge of health risks and benefits of different health practices, perceived self-efficacy, outcome expectations about the expected costs and benefits, health goals people set for themselves, and perceived facilitators and social and structural impediments” can translate knowledge into effective health practices [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref37\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></span>]. Building self-efficacy (confidence in one’s ability to perform a desired health behavior) and self-regulation (goal setting and planning) are key constructs of the SCT that guided the development of RealConsent.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">In developing RealConsent, extensive formative research with the targeted population was conducted to assess the different contexts in which exposure to SV occurs, how men and women express sexual interest and consent, reasons for alcohol use, protective strategies to avoid SV, SV survivor blaming, barriers to bystander intervention, and stereotypical gender roles. The results were used to inform the content, messaging, language, and storylines for each segment and particularly for the serial drama titled <i>Squad</i>. Once the intervention module content was developed on paper, before production, an additional round of focus groups was conducted to assess the acceptability and relevance of the materials and scripts in terms of literacy, language, realism, presentation, and delivery.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The learning objectives of RealConsent were to (1) increase young women’s awareness of the risks of alcohol use, (2) enhance the skills necessary for engaging in alcohol-related protective behaviors, (3) raise awareness of dating-related risk factors for exposure to SV, and (4) teach effective prosocial bystander intervention and self-defense strategies. To achieve these objectives, RealConsent used several behavior change techniques [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref38\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></span>] (eg, model or demonstrate behavior, provide information on consequences, and provide information on the link between behavior and health) to target SCT-related theoretical mediators [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref39\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></span>] such as increasing knowledge of protective tactics while consuming alcohol; the role of alcohol use in SV and consent for sex; changing outcome expectancies toward consuming alcohol in risky contexts; increasing self-efficacy for bystander intervention, safe alcohol consumption, sexual communication, and protective sexual strategies; and increasing social learning strategies for bystander behavior, resistance behaviors, self-defense, assertive communication, and safe alcohol use. Refer to <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app1\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 1</a></span> for the full module matrix with learning objectives, behavior change strategies used, theoretical mediators, and intended behavioral goal of each module.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">RealConsent was delivered via a password-protected web portal that allowed participants to access the program either via the web or their mobile phones. The program contains four 45-minute program modules for a total duration of 3 hours. Each module includes interactivity, didactic activities, and entertainment-education media [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref40\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref41\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></span>]. Entertainment-education is an effective health communication strategy that combines or embeds educational messages into entertainment programs to bring about social and behavior change [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref41\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></span>]. RealConsent contains 8 mini-episodes of a serial drama titled <i>Squad</i> as its entertainment-education component. To ensure the relevance and quality of <i>Squad</i>, we worked with a professional scriptwriter so that our dialogue was realistic and entertaining. In addition, we contracted with a professional film and video company that had won several Emmy awards for their documentary films to film, direct, and edit our video segments. Consequently, the <i>Squad</i> serial drama garnered 4 Telly Awards. Telly Awards honor excellence in video and television across all platforms. The <i>Squad</i> episodes allow for the modeling of positive behaviors and for illustrating both positive and negative outcome expectations related to alcohol misuse and bystander intervention. RealConsent includes ethnically and racially diverse actors in its filmed segments and in images accompanying the didactic segments; in addition, it includes representation of same-sex relationships. RealConsent was programmed so that participants could not skip or click through segments within each module without viewing the entire segment. In addition, the program contained an administrative component that allowed study staff to track participants’ completion of the program.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\"><i>Stress and Mood Management</i> is a web-based multimedia health promotion program developed by ISA Group and designed to help manage stress levels; prevent mood problems; and seek early identification of, and treatment for, depression and anxiety. Each of the 4 program modules is approximately 30 minutes long and involves videos as well as interactive and didactic activities. Thus, it approximates RealConsent in format and duration.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Primary Outcome: Exposure to SV</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Exposure to SV was assessed with the Revised Sexual Experiences Survey developed by Koss et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref42\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></span>]. Behaviorally specific language was used to describe unwanted sexual experience outcomes and tactics. The types of unwanted sexual behavior assessed included sexual contact (eg, fondling) and attempted or completed penetration (oral, vaginal, or anal). The tactics included two forms of verbal coercion, including (1) telling lies, making verbal threats, making promises known to be untrue, or using verbal pressure; and (2) showing displeasure, criticizing, or getting angry, as well as incapacitation (ie, taking advantage when the participant was <i>too drunk or out of it</i> to stop what was happening), and two forms of physical force, including (1) threatening physical force and (2) the use of physical force. Participants were asked how often each sexual experience was obtained by each tactic, with response options ranging from 0 (<i>never</i>) to 3 (<i>≥3 times</i>). At baseline, <i>in the past 12 months</i> was used as the time reference, and at the 6-month follow-up, <i>since viewing the web-based program</i> was the time reference<i>.</i> Exposure to SV was analyzed in 2 ways as recommended by Davis et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref43\" rel=\"footnote\">43</a></span>] and takes into consideration the severity of the violence (eg, <i>fondling</i> vs <i>completed vaginal rape</i>) as well as the tactic used (eg, <i>alcohol incapacitated</i> vs <i>physical force</i>) in addition to the frequency. The combined outcomes separated tactics scoring method (COSTS) resulted in a continuous construct with a range of 0 to 63 where 6 severity ranks were used. For the rape outcomes that had the same tactic (eg, <i>attempted rape by force</i> and <i>completed rape by force</i>), each was given the same severity rank. Each severity score was multiplied by the frequency and then summed. The separated outcomes separated tactics scoring method (SOTS) also resulted in a continuous construct but with a range of 0 to 135 where each outcome by each tactic was ranked by severity from 1 (sexual contact with verbal coercion) to 9 (completed rape by force) and then multiplied by the frequency [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref43\" rel=\"footnote\">43</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<h4>Secondary Outcomes</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Alcohol protective behaviors were assessed with 15 items from the Protective Behavioral Strategies Survey [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref44\" rel=\"footnote\">44</a></span>], with answer choices ranging on a 5-point scale from 1 (<i>always</i>) to 5 (<i>never</i>). Participants were asked whether, while using alcohol or <i>partying,</i> they engaged in alcohol-related protective behaviors (eg, <i>determine not to exceed a set number of drinks</i>, <i>avoid mixing different types of alcohol</i>, and <i>know where your drink has been at all times</i>). For this study, the scale showed adequate reliability (Cronbach α=.86). Items were summed for a total score for engaging in protective behaviors.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Dating risk behaviors were assessed using the Dating Behavior Survey, which consists of 15 items assessing the situational variables, including alcohol use, that have been found to be related to acquaintance rape [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref45\" rel=\"footnote\">45</a></span>]. Participants indicated how often they engaged in situational behaviors that would put them at risk (eg, on the first few dates...<i>I consume alcohol or drugs</i>, or <i>my partner and I do things that allow us to spend time alone together</i>). Answer choices ranged on a 5-point scale from 1 (<i>never</i>) to 5 (<i>always</i>). For this study, reliability was adequate (Cronbach α=.71). Responses were summed for a total score for risk-related dating behavior.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Alcohol use was assessed using several items from the Daily Drinking Questionnaire-Revised [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref46\" rel=\"footnote\">46</a></span>]. Participants were asked to report the number of times they consumed ≥4 alcoholic drinks in 1 sitting in the last 30 days (<i>binge drinking</i>), the number of drinks consumed as well as the number of hours they drank each day for a typical week (<i>average number of drinks per hour)</i>, and the number of drinks consumed on 1 occasion where they <i>drank the most</i> during the past 30 days (<i>heavy drinking)</i>.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Bystander behavior was assessed using the 20-item Bystander Behavior Scale [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref47\" rel=\"footnote\">47</a></span>]. The items assessed whether participants engaged in bystander behaviors in the past 3 months and included items such as <i>If I saw someone taking a very intoxicated person up to their room, I said something and asked what the friend was doing</i>. Response options included how many times they intervened (eg, 1, 2, or ≥3) or <i>no opportunity</i>. For this study, reliability was adequate (Cronbach α=.84). Responses were summed for a total score for bystander behavior.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Data Analysis</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The primary outcome was exposure to SV; the secondary outcomes were alcohol and dating protective behaviors, alcohol use behaviors, and bystander intervention. Sample size calculations for the primary outcome were estimated to guarantee that power would be at least 0.80 for the detection of a small-to-moderate effect size (Cohen <i>h</i>≥0.35). With 2 study groups, we estimated a needed sample size of at least 670; however, we factored in anticipated 20% attrition, which meant that we needed to enroll <i>at least</i> 750 participants (375 in each group) to increase power.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Analyses were performed on prespecified hypotheses for the primary outcome variable of exposure to SV using an intent-to-treat protocol in which participants were analyzed according to their assigned study conditions [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref48\" rel=\"footnote\">48</a></span>]. Additional analyses were also performed on several secondary outcomes, including alcohol protective behaviors, dating risk behaviors, and alcohol misuse, using an intent-to-treat protocol. Statisticians were blinded to which group (<i>a</i> or <i>b</i>) was the experimental condition. An additional secondary outcome, bystander behavior, was also analyzed using a <i>dosage</i> protocol versus an intent-to-treat protocol. Participants who had completed 100% of the RealConsent program were compared with the control group participants plus those participants who had completed &lt;100% of the program. Dosage was used to test for effects on bystander behavior because intervention content specific to bystander behavior was in the last module of the program.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Descriptive statistics were created for all study measures, with mean and SD for continuous variables and frequency distribution for categorical variables. Comparisons were conducted of baseline findings across study characteristics and outcomes to determine whether participants who completed the intervention were similar to those who did not.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A substantial number of participants were expected to report not having an experience of exposure to SV, to not have engaged in bystander behavior, and to not having previously consumed alcohol. To account for these zero occurrences, a comparison of the mean occurrence for each outcome across the baseline and 6-month follow-up time points was accomplished with a 2-stage modeling process using zero-inflated regression models. In the first stage, a logistic regression model was used to model occurrence or not for each outcome, and in the second stage, a Poisson or gamma regression model was used to model each outcome for those who had at least 1 occurrence. Exposure to SV and most of the alcohol consumption measurements were count outcomes and modeled with the Poisson distribution. The alcohol protective and dating risk behaviors scales were both continuous and reasonably symmetric. A multilevel model in the form of a general linear mixed model was used. The Bystander Behavior Scale was skewed and assessed with logistic regression; heavy drinking outcomes were continuous and skewed and were modeled with a gamma distribution.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Participants were assessed at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. Repeated measurements on each participant results in within-participant correlation. This was accounted for by estimating each zero-inflated model with population-averaged effects using a marginal model and generalized estimating equations. Each zero-inflated marginal model included fixed effects to control for study site, race, ethnicity, place of living, relationship status, sexual orientation, engagement in athletics, job status, ever drank alcohol, time, and study condition. A time × study condition interaction term was included in each model to assess and test for intervention effectiveness. The interaction term quantifies the relative change in the outcome over time across study conditions. Intervention effects were estimated with odds ratios for logistic models, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for Poisson models, and regression coefficients for gamma models. SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc) was used for all statistical analyses.</p>\n",

       "<h4>Overview</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The recruitment process (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure2\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 2</a></span>) resulted in 4473 first-year college students, who identified as women, who were screened for eligibility. Of these 4473 students, 2327 (52.02%) were not eligible, 349 (7.8%) did not undergo the informed consent process, 8 (0.18%) declined to participate, and 908 (20.3%) did not enroll for other reasons, whereas 881 (19.7%) consented, completed baseline assessment, and were then randomized. At 6 months, 161 (18.3%) of the 881 participants were lost to follow-up. The chi-square results indicated that there was not differential attrition: 85 (19.1%) of the 444 participants in the RealConsent condition were lost to follow-up versus 76 (17.4%) of the 437 participants in the placebo comparison condition (<i>P</i>=.83).</p>\n",
       "<h4>Participant Characteristics</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Being aged 18 to 20 years was an eligibility criterion; thus, the sample mirrored this age range. Most of the participants (642/881, 72.9%) were aged 18 years, followed by those aged 19 years (230/881, 26.1%) and 20 years (9/881, 1%). The racial breakdown of participants was as follows: American Indian or Alaska Native (6/881, 0.7%), Asian (176/881, 20%), Black or African American (213/881, 24.2%), Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (3/881, 0.3%), White (394/881, 44.7%), biracial or multiracial (76/881, 8.6%), and other (13/881, 1.5%). Hispanic or Latinx participants constituted 12.3% (108/881) of the sample. In terms of gender identity, most of the participants (873/881, 99.1%) identified as woman, and 0.9% (8/881) identified as nonconforming or nonbinary. Regarding sexual orientation, most of the participants (724/881, 82.2%) identified as heterosexual, 11.4% (100/881) identified as bisexual, 2.5% (22/881) identified as gay or lesbian, 1.5% (13/881) as queer, and 2.5% (22/881) as other. Most of the participants were full-time students (879/881, 99.8%), single (845/881, 95.9%), and lived in campus dorms or housing (614/881, 69.7%). A small number of the participants were members of athletic teams (115/881, 13.1%). Overall, the prevalence of exposure to SV before starting college was 27.4% (241/881). <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table1\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 1</a></span> provides data on the breakdown of sociodemographic variables and outcome variables by study condition.</p>\n",

       "<h4>Completers Versus Noncompleters</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Analyses were completed to assess the differences in study covariates and outcomes at baseline between those who completed the 6-month follow-up assessment and those who were lost to follow-up. As shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table2\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 2</a></span>, there was a higher percentage of dropouts versus completers (28/161, 17.4% vs 80/720, 11.1%, respectively) who identified as Hispanic (<i>P</i>=.03). On average, completers had lower levels of binge drinking and dating risk behaviors. Completers and noncompleters did not differ on any other covariates or outcomes.</p>\n",

       "<h4>Primary Outcome (Exposure to SV): SOTS and COSTS Outcomes</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The sexual experience survey measures frequency and severity of exposure to SV in the form of behavioral counts. Thus, to model these counting processes, a Poisson regression framework was used for the SOTS and COSTS outcomes. Of the 881 participants, 640 (72.6%) had a zero baseline SOTS and COSTS score. To account for repeated measurements taken over 2 time points and the excess zeros, multilevel zero-inflated Poisson regression models were used. With multilevel zero-inflated Poisson models, the outcome was modeled as a mixture of 2 distributions. First, a binomial distribution was used to fit a logistic regression model to a dichotomy: the occurrence of exposure to SV (score&gt;0) versus no exposure to SV (score=0). For this logistic regression, only 1 model was run because the dichotomy distributions for SOTS and COSTS are equivalent. Second, a Poisson regression model with overdispersion was used to model participants who had some occurrence of exposure to SV (score&gt;0). A random effect for participant was included in each model to account for the correlated repeated measurements resulting from baseline and follow-up measurements. The results are presented in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table3\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 3</a></span>.</p>\n",

       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">As shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table3\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 3</a></span>, for the zero-inflated SOTS and COSTS model for exposure to SV, controlling for other covariates, although the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) was protective (ie, less likely to experience SV over time), this result was not significant (AOR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47-1.28; <i>P</i>=.32). For the Poisson regression model with overdispersion, controlling for other covariates, participants in the RealConsent group who had experienced some exposure to SV were found to have a significant decrease in levels of exposure to SV compared with those in the control condition (adjusted IRR estimate 0.48, 95% CI 0.33-0.69; <i>P</i>&lt;.001).</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">For COSTS, similarly, for the Poisson regression model with overdispersion, controlling for other covariates, participants in the RealConsent group who had experienced some exposure to SV were found to have a significant decrease in levels of exposure to SV compared with those in the control condition (adjusted IRR estimate 0.56, 95% CI 0.40-0.78; <i>P</i>=.001).</p>\n",
       "<h4>Secondary Outcomes</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The effect of RealConsent on alcohol protective behaviors was modeled with a general linear mixed model. The time × study condition effect was significant (AOR 1.17, 95% CI 0.12-2.22; <i>P</i>=.03). Participants in the RealConsent group were more likely to engage in alcohol-related protective behaviors than those in the placebo control condition.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The effect of RealConsent on dating risk behaviors was modeled with a general linear mixed model. Although the effect was in the hypothesized direction, the time × study condition effect was not significant (AOR −0.50, 95% CI −1.27 to 0.27; <i>P</i>=.20).</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">We examined the effects of RealConsent on several alcohol outcome variables. As shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table4\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 4</a></span>, no significant results were found for number of alcohol drinks per occasion or average number of alcoholic drinks per hour. Significant results were found for binge drinking: for the Poisson regression model with overdispersion, controlling for covariates, participants in the RealConsent group had lower rates of binge drinking than those in the control condition (adjusted IRR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67-0.97; <i>P</i>=.02).</p>\n",

       "<p><sup>c</sup>N/A: not applicable.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">To test whether RealConsent was effective in increasing bystander behavior, we tested the model using <i>dosage</i> as the independent variable (because module 4, the last module, was specific to bystander intervention). The dosage groups were as follows: (1) the RealConsent group participants at 6-month follow-up who had completed 4 modules (305/444,68.7%) versus (2) the RealConsent group participants who had not completed all 4 modules (54/444, 12.2%) plus the control group participants (361/437, 82.6%). The distribution at baseline for this continuous variable included 33.5% (241/720) of the participants who did not exhibit bystander behavior (score=0). A multilevel logistic regression model was developed. This modeling approach accounts for the within-participant correlation resulting from repeated measurements taken over 2 time points. The outcome was occurrence of bystander behavior (score&gt;0) versus no bystander behavior (score=0). A random effect for participant was included in the model to account for the correlated repeated measurements resulting from baseline and follow-up measurements. Controlling for covariates, participants in the RealConsent group who had 100% dosage were found to have increased odds of engaging in any bystander behavior compared with those who had &lt;100% dosage plus the control group (AOR estimate 1.72, 95% CI 1.17-2.55; <i>P</i>=.006).</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Discussion\" data-label=\"Discussion\">Discussion</h3>\n",
       "<h4>Principal Findings</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">This study is the first comprehensive SV risk reduction program specific to women that incorporates entertainment-education media into web-based and mobile technologies, is theoretically and empirically informed, embodies proven behavior change techniques, includes alcohol education as a central component, and integrates bystander education as well as self-defense training—all factors associated with SV risk reduction. The results from this RCT demonstrate significant changes in both primary and secondary outcomes among a racially diverse sample of first-year college students who identified as women. Among participants who had experienced any SV, RealConsent participants reported less exposure to SV (primary outcome) than control group participants (<i>P</i>&lt;.001). This result suggests that RealConsent is effective for participants who are most at risk. Although we did not find significant results for our zero-inflated logistic model, which compared no exposure to SV to any exposure to SV by condition, we can speculate possible reasons for this null finding. First, because of RealConsent’s central focus on alcohol misuse and highlighting the heightened risks for alcohol-related SV, it may be that the content resonated more with participants who had been previously exposed to SV because research shows that alcohol misuse can be a consequence of exposure to SV [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref4\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref49\" rel=\"footnote\">49</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref50\" rel=\"footnote\">50</a></span>]. Another potential explanation relates to external events. Since the passing of the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act in 2013, institutions of higher learning (those that participate in federal student aid programs) are required to provide campus community-wide prevention educational programming. The college students who identified as women in our sample most likely underwent their respective colleges’ required SV prevention programming, which incoming first-year students are mandated to complete the summer before the semester begins. In addition, campus administrative offices such as residence life, student health services, and student affairs may have also implemented additional trainings and awareness events throughout the fall semester during the high-risk period known as the <i>red zone</i> [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref34\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref51\" rel=\"footnote\">51</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref52\" rel=\"footnote\">52</a></span>]. The <i>red zone</i> describes the heightened risk of exposure to SV for first-year college students who identified as women during their fall semester [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref34\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref51\" rel=\"footnote\">51</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref52\" rel=\"footnote\">52</a></span>]. As the study participants were recruited from 3 separate universities, it is likely that students were exposed to other SV prevention messaging during the study implementation period [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref34\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref52\" rel=\"footnote\">52</a></span>]. It is plausible that these external events affected overall exposure to SV incidence at follow-up, resulting in inadequate statistical power and contributing to the null findings. Moreover, research has shown that overall rates of exposure to SV drop after the first semester’s <i>red zone</i> period has elapsed. Thus, a naturally occurring drop in SV rates overall could have contributed to the null findings. A final potential explanation is contamination, whereby some of the participants in the experimental group may have discussed or even shared some of the information learned with friends who were in the attention-matched placebo group. Contamination generally biases the estimated treatment effect toward the null [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref53\" rel=\"footnote\">53</a></span>]. Trials of educational prevention interventions are particularly vulnerable to such bias [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref53\" rel=\"footnote\">53</a></span>]. In this trial, participants in the attention-matched placebo arm may have been exposed to RealConsent messages indirectly through participants in the RealConsent condition interacting with them and possibly sharing information, promoting new social norms, or even encouraging and modeling behavior change. As randomization was at the individual level, and 69.7% (614/881) of our sample reported living in the dorms, that is, in close proximity to each other, and the participants in this trial were all first-year students, contamination for this null effect could be a possible explanation.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">With a preponderance of evidence to support the link between alcohol misuse and exposure to SV [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref15\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref30\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref31\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref49\" rel=\"footnote\">49</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref51\" rel=\"footnote\">51</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref54\" rel=\"footnote\">54</a></span>] and with research showing that alcohol consumption that results in incapacitation or blackouts is common on college campuses [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref55\" rel=\"footnote\">55</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref56\" rel=\"footnote\">56</a></span>], it is critical to approach SV risk reduction by targeting both alcohol misuse and alcohol-related protective behaviors such as <i>know where your drink has been at all times</i> and <i>alternate alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks</i>. RealConsent showed a significant increase in alcohol-related protective behaviors (<i>P</i>=.03) and was protective against binge drinking (<i>P</i>=.003) (secondary outcomes). Further research that examines whether these secondary outcomes act as mediators of RealConsent’s effect on exposure to SV outcomes is warranted.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">We also observed significant effects (<i>P</i>=.006) for 1 other secondary outcome: bystander behavior. Although there are various effective bystander intervention programs [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref57\" rel=\"footnote\">57</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref60\" rel=\"footnote\">60</a></span>], to our knowledge, only 1 other program has been <i>specific to women</i> (<i>The Women’s Program</i> [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref61\" rel=\"footnote\">61</a></span>]); however, bystander behaviors were not assessed in the study, and it is unclear whether the program affected bystander behavior. One critique of SV risk reduction targeting women has been that effects are limited to only those women who undergo the program and that a burden is placed on women as solely responsible for avoidance of exposure to SV [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref62\" rel=\"footnote\">62</a></span>]. It is plausible that by incorporating bystander education into our SV risk reduction program, this burden as well as defensiveness were reduced, and women felt empowered. Future research that examines these potential mechanisms is warranted.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The range of effects observed in this RCT could be explained by several factors. First, in developing RealConsent, we engaged in extensive formative research to ensure acceptability and relevance. These formative research steps have been highlighted as being critical for developing effective interventions [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref63\" rel=\"footnote\">63</a></span>] and were also used to develop the men's version of RealConsent [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref64\" rel=\"footnote\">64</a></span>]. The acceptability of an intervention is necessary but perhaps not sufficient for effectiveness; however, if an intervention is considered acceptable, then the target audience is more likely to benefit from improved outcomes [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref65\" rel=\"footnote\">65</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">In addition, intervention implementation, delivery, and mode of delivery are relevant to acceptability. Delivery and the mode of delivery can include program format and content, which may considerably affect an intervention [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></span>]. Mode of delivery may be especially relevant for members of Generation Z (those born between 1996 and 2015 and our targeted population), for whom social media, constant connectivity, and on-demand entertainment and communication were the norm growing up [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref66\" rel=\"footnote\">66</a></span>]. With the ubiquity and popularity of streaming services (eg, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu) to access entertainment, especially for members of Generation Z, RealConsent’s mode of delivery via web-based or mobile platforms may have resonated and been more acceptable versus an in-person didactic mode and may have contributed to the effects observed. Equally important to the mode of delivery, however, is the production quality of the entertainment-education media within a program. With a vast array of high-quality and high-production content available and regularly viewed by our targeted population, it is important to consider whether an entertainment-education effort can successfully garner participant interest in an environment full of competing entertainment messages. Although participants agreed to complete the program modules as part of this RCT, completion was not mandatory, and all participants had the option to drop out, withdraw, or, if so inclined, simply not view the content while it was running. In viewing RealConsent completion rates, our results show that 75.5% (335/444) of the participants completed all 4 modules of the program, which can be viewed as a high percentage of completion for a web-based program [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref67\" rel=\"footnote\">67</a></span>] and which suggests perceived relevance and quality. Further research regarding the acceptability of RealConsent and its relevance and perceived quality in terms of entertainment value is warranted.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Another aspect of program format related directly to observed effects is duration. As is the case with efficacious SV risk reduction programs such as the Enhanced Assess, Acknowledge, Act program developed by Senn et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref23\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></span>] and the self-defense classes for college women analyzed by Hollander [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref32\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></span>], longer duration has been effective in affecting behavior and improving attitudes, whereas programs with a brief duration (eg, a lecture) may be more impactful at reducing rape myth acceptance [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></span>]. One exception is the web-based SV and alcohol use program developed by Gilmore et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref27\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></span>], which targeted college women aged 18 to 20 years who engage in heavy episodic drinking (eg, consuming ≥4 alcoholic beverages at least twice within the past month). Although shorter in duration than the program developed by Senn et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref23\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></span>] (12 hours) or the self-defense classes for college women (45 hours) [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref32\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></span>], RealConsent’s 3-hour duration produced efficacious results at 6 months for women most at risk and for multiple secondary outcomes. Further research is warranted to examine whether the observed effects would be maintained at 1 year.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Another program aspect that may be related to efficacy is the use of a theoretical framework and behavior change techniques to inform and guide content and activities. Research has overwhelmingly shown that health behavior theories contribute greatly to our understanding of behavior and behavior change [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref36\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></span>]. In addition, a systematic review and meta-analysis of web-based eHealth behavioral interventions found that the use of health behavior theory and incorporation of more behavior change techniques were both associated with greater effect sizes [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref68\" rel=\"footnote\">68</a></span>], suggesting that, in general, behavioral interventions guided by health behavior theory are more efficacious than nontheory-based interventions. The SCT guided the development of RealConsent content. We also incorporated multiple proven behavior change techniques [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref38\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></span>], such as modeling positive behaviors, providing information on consequences of behavior, providing information on the link between behavior and health outcomes, identifying barriers, and providing feedback on performance. This comprehensive approach to intervention development may have improved the ability of the RealConsent intervention to achieve significant effects on several behavioral outcomes. Further research that examines whether the significant effects observed are direct effects or indirect effects through the theoretical mediators is warranted and will reveal RealConsent’s mechanism of action. Such information can be used for future behavioral interventions targeting similar outcomes. Finally, single-sex program formats for female participants have also been found to be more effective than mixed-sex programming at improving a host of risk factors for exposure to SV [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></span>] and may have contributed to the observed significant findings.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Limitations and Strengths</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Our trial included several limitations. First, our trial was conducted with first-year college students who identified as women, recruited from 3 universities located in the southeastern United States. Future research should test RealConsent among college women at universities located in other geographical areas of the United States. Second, although it was not extreme, we experienced some loss to follow-up in terms of completion of the respective web-based programs and follow-up survey. It is unclear what the potential reasons were for this loss to follow-up; however, previous research has shown that attrition in web-based trials may be higher than that in in-person trials [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref67\" rel=\"footnote\">67</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref69\" rel=\"footnote\">69</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref70\" rel=\"footnote\">70</a></span>]. Nevertheless, our observed attrition rates (overall 161/881, 18.3%) are lower than (eg, 40% [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref71\" rel=\"footnote\">71</a></span>]), or in line with (eg, 18% [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref72\" rel=\"footnote\">72</a></span>]), other <i>in-person</i> SV risk reduction trials with similar follow-up periods. Third, although the RCT design controls for many threats to internal validity, this trial was implemented in the field as opposed to a laboratory setting, where it was impossible to control for all external events. Nonetheless, there are several strengths. RealConsent was developed with extensive formative research with the targeted population, and its content is theoretically informed. The RCT was implemented with a large racially diverse sample of college students who identified as women; in addition, participants were masked to study hypotheses and biostatisticians were blinded to group condition, all of which represent significant methodological strengths.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Conclusions</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">This RCT showed that a 3-hour comprehensive web-based or mobile-based program tailored to first-year college women was efficacious in substantially reducing the occurrence of exposure to SV among those at higher risk because of previous exposure to SV, reducing binge drinking, increasing alcohol-related protective behaviors, and increasing bystander behavior. RealConsent can be easily disseminated owing to its web-based and mobile technology and holds potential to reach large numbers of college women and perhaps reduce overall incidence of exposure to SV.</p>\n",

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Background: </span>Taxonomies and models are useful tools for defining eHealth content and intervention features, enabling comparison and analysis of research across studies and disciplines. The Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy version 1 (BCTTv1) was developed to decrease ambiguity in defining specific characteristics inherent in health interventions, but it was developed outside the context of digital technology. In contrast, the Persuasive System Design Model (PSDM) was developed to define and evaluate the persuasive content in software solutions but did not have a specific focus on health. Both the BCTTv1 and PSDM have been used to define eHealth interventions in the literature, with some researchers combining or reducing the taxonomies to simplify their application. It is unclear how well the taxonomies accurately define eHealth and whether they should be used alone or in combination.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>This scoping review explored how the BCTTv1 and PSDM capture the content and intervention features of parent-focused eHealth as part of a program of studies investigating the use of technology to support parents with therapy home programs for children with special health care needs. It explored the active ingredients and persuasive technology features commonly found in parent-focused eHealth interventions for children with special health care needs and how the descriptions overlap and interact with respect to the BCTTv1 and PSDM taxonomies.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>A scoping review was used to clarify concepts in the literature related to these taxonomies. Keywords related to parent-focused eHealth were defined and used to systematically search several electronic databases for parent-focused eHealth publications. Publications referencing the same intervention were combined to provide comprehensive intervention details. The data set was coded using codebooks developed from the taxonomies in NVivo (version 12; QSR International) and qualitatively analyzed using matrix queries.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>The systematic search found 23 parent-focused eHealth interventions described in 42 articles from various countries; delivered to parents with children aged 1 to 18 years; and covering medical, behavioral, and developmental issues. The predominant active ingredients and intervention features in parent-focused eHealth were concerned with teaching parents behavioral skills, encouraging them to practice and monitor the new skills, and tracking the outcomes of performing the new skills. No category had a complete set of active ingredients or intervention features coded.

       "<h4>Background</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Taxonomies and models are useful tools for defining eHealth intervention content and delivery, enabling the comparison and analysis of research across studies and disciplines [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></span>]. The Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy version 1 (BCTTv1) was developed to decrease ambiguity in defining specific characteristics inherent in health interventions [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></span>], but it was developed outside the context of digital technology. In contrast, the Persuasive System Design Model (PSDM) was developed to define and evaluate the persuasive content in software solutions but did not have a specific focus on health [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref3\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></span>]. Both the BCTTv1 and PSDM have been used to define eHealth interventions in the literature [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref4\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref9\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></span>], with some researchers combining the taxonomies to include both the health and persuasive technology components [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref10\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref12\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></span>]. However, there have been concerns regarding the ability of the taxonomies to capture the variability and dynamic nature of health interventions [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref13\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref15\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></span>]. In addition, it is unclear how well the BCTTv1 and PSDM accurately define eHealth and whether they should be used alone or in combination. Therefore, a scoping review methodology was used to develop a relevant data set to explore how the BCTTv1 and PSDM capture the content and delivery of eHealth interventions. The scope was concerned with parent-focused eHealth as part of a program of studies investigating the use of technology to support parents with therapy home programs for children with special health care needs.</p>\n",
       "<h4>The Taxonomies</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The BCTTv1 taxonomy defines 93 distinct behavior change techniques (BCTs) categorized into 16 behavioral determinants. The behavioral determinants include categories common to many behavior change theories, such as goals and planning, social support, and shaping knowledge [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref16\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></span>]. The BCT represents the smallest component of a behavior change theory that could bring about a change in behavior under the right circumstances. As such, BCTs are described as the “active ingredients” of an intervention [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref17\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Persuasive technology [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref18\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></span>] refers to the use of technology, such as computers, mobile devices, and the internet, to influence and change people’s attitudes or behaviors. Although technology is often described as a service delivery vehicle in eHealth, digital applications that are responsive to a user’s input can mimic social drivers of behavior and are more persuasive than static communication media such as print [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref19\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref20\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></span>]. Persuasive technology ranges from simple nudges and reminders to more complex interactive systems that use personalized feedback and rewards to motivate and engage users. On the basis of the earlier work by Fogg [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref18\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></span>] describing persuasive technology, Oinas-Kukkonen and Harjumaa [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref3\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></span>] proposed the PSDM grouping of 28 persuasive system design (PSD) elements into 4 design principles. A fifth design principle was later added to capture the coaching elements found in many eHealth interventions [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref6\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></span>]. Despite being called a model, the PSDM does not define the relationships between the design elements and principles [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref21\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></span>] and, thus, can be considered a taxonomy akin to the BCTTv1 [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref12\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The BCTTv1 and PSDM have a different focus; however, there is considerable overlap in the categories and principles of these 2 taxonomies. Therefore, some systematic reviewers have merged labels within the 2 taxonomies ad hoc [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref9\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref12\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></span>]. However, labels within the 2 taxonomies may describe different characteristics of the same eHealth intervention. For example, <i>Self-Monitoring</i> from the BCTTv1 is a BCT that includes activities such as using a diary or checklist to self-monitor behavior. This requires some discipline and commitment to keep track of what is being monitored. In persuasive technology, <i>Self-Monitoring</i> defines an automated feature of technology that requires little effort from the user but potentially requires the user to give up a level of privacy for the convenience of having the technology do the monitoring for them. <i>Self-Monitoring</i> as captured by these 2 taxonomies clearly represents different behaviors and experiences for the user and, therefore, potentially different outcomes.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Combining multiple taxonomies to define an intervention presents a challenge in terms of efficiency and usability. Although merging taxonomies based on similar labels or constructs may improve efficiency, it could also result in the omission of important ingredients or features. Therefore, this review explores the similarities and differences between the BCTTv1 and PSDM to gain a deeper understanding of their usability individually and in combination to define the content and delivery of digital interventions in parent-focused eHealth.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Methods\" data-label=\"Methods\">Methods</h3>\n",
       "<h4>Overview</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Scoping reviews are an alternative to systematic reviews when there is a need to clarify characteristics related to a concept in the literature [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref22\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref23\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></span>]. As scoping reviews are not intended to inform practice or answer effectiveness questions, they do not include a critical appraisal of the literature and cannot be used to determine intervention effectiveness [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref24\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref25\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></span>]. Scoping reviews require a systematic review approach and provide a methodologically rigorous structure; however, they are intended to be iterative. The search terms and questions are refined as the researchers become immersed in the available literature [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref24\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref25\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></span>]. The PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref26\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></span>] accommodate changes in scoping review protocols over time and guided this scoping review report [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref27\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></span>], along with the original framework provided by Arksey and O’Malley [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref24\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<h4>Population</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Parents of children with special health care needs were the population of interest in this scoping review. Children with special health care needs are defined as children with “chronic physical, developmental, behavioural, or emotional conditions who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required of children generally” [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref28\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<h4>Context</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Many parent-focused eHealth interventions use computer-mediated interactions as a primary feature, involving mostly synchronous videoconferencing between the parent and the therapist [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref29\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></span>]. However, persuasive technology was a key interest, and therefore, the eHealth interventions needed to predominantly include human-computer interaction to be included in this scoping review. In other words, the parents needed to interact directly with a digital application that was responsive to their input. In addition, the continuous evolution of technology highlights the importance of focusing on underlying principles that define the core functionality of eHealth interventions to facilitate research and future development [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref30\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref32\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></span>]. Therefore, the context of this scoping review included all parent-focused eHealth interventions regardless of the underlying theories, application, platform, or device being used.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Content</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The search was pragmatically limited to articles published after 2008, when both the BCTTv1 and PSDM were first published [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref3\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></span>], and the subsequent 10-year period in accordance with recommendations for limiting the number of articles in a scoping review [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref33\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></span>]. This provided a comprehensive yet manageable database to examine the relationship, similarities, and differences between the BCTTv1 and PSDM, providing insights into how the active principles captured by these taxonomies could be applied in future studies.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Objectives</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The objective of this scoping review was to develop novel insights into how the BCTTv1 and PSDM, 2 increasingly popular taxonomies, identify active ingredients and features of eHealth interventions to inform future research and design.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">This review answered two questions: (1) What are the active ingredients and persuasive technology features commonly found in parent-focused eHealth interventions for children with special health care needs? and (2) How do the active ingredients and features described in parent-focused eHealth literature overlap and interact with respect to the BCTTv1 and PSDM taxonomies?</p>\n",
       "<h4>Variation From the Published Protocol</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A protocol for this scoping review was published elsewhere [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref34\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></span>]. Consistent with the iterative and responsive nature of scoping reviews [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref33\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></span>], three variations from the protocol are noted. First, the term “ingredients and features” replaced the term “principles” to decrease ambiguity in terminology. Second, the term <i>persuasive eCoaching</i> did not replace PSDM as originally suggested. Further immersion in the data and related literature found that the elements suggested by Lentferink et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref6\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></span>] did not reflect an eCoaching process.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The third variation related to the illustration within the protocol depicting the relationship between the PSDM and BCTTv1. This figure has been updated (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure1\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 1</a></span>) in light of scoping review findings. The labels within the figure were changed to more accurately represent the components of the behavior change models related to the 2 taxonomies (previously labeled <i>Behavior Targets</i>) and behavior outcomes (previously labeled <i>Behavior</i>). The additional PSD category and elements suggested to represent coaching elements of eHealth [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref6\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></span>] were also included as PSD principles (increased from 4 to 5) and elements (increased from 28 to 32). The updated figure illustrates how the BCTTv1 and PSDM relate and link to behavioral outcomes through their related models: the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation–Behavior (COM-B) model and the Fogg Behavior Model (FBM), respectively. Each model is made up of behavior components linked to BCTs and PSD elements that represent the behavioral determinants and design principle categories in the taxonomies. The 9 intervention functions linking BCTs to behavioral components in the BCTTv1 have also been included.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Search Strategy</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The search strategy was informed by guidelines for scoping reviews [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref24\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref26\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref35\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></span>] and included a systematic search of MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL (EBSCOhost), and ERIC (Ovid) to identify potentially relevant articles. Keywords related to parent-focused eHealth were used, where the parent was the intended target of the intervention and their child’s health or behavior was the intended outcome. To be included, interventions required human-computer interaction. For the purpose of this review, human-computer interaction was conceptualized as user-generated content and an element of automation to support the parents’ behavior change. Interventions that were predominantly a replacement for face-to-face interventions or coaching (ie, computer-mediated synchronous communication), were not interactive (eg, static text, such as a digital version of an information pamphlet), or were solely intended as an education platform were excluded for this reason. In addition, as the aim of the larger study was to support parents, interventions that predominantly required the child rather than the parent to interact with the technology were also excluded. A detailed list of the inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table1\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 1</a></span>.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Keywords were developed and refined through an exploratory search of the literature using Scopus. Keywords, Medical Subject Heading terms, and Excerpta Medica Tree terms were tested in Scopus and then extrapolated to match the criteria of the remaining databases in consultation with a medical librarian. Keywords (detailed in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app1\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 1</a></span>) were used to conduct an electronic search of MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL (EBSCOhost), and ERIC (Ovid). The search yielded 9405 articles published between 2009 and 2018.</p>\n",
       "<p><sup>a</sup>PSD: persuasive system design.</p>\n",
       "<p><sup>b</sup>BCT: behavior change technique.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Screening for Eligibility</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">After duplicate removal, 4843 abstracts were screened stepwise at the title (n=3228, 66.65% remaining), abstract (n=136, 2.81% remaining), and full text (n=102, 2.11% remaining) levels. After duplicates were removed, titles and abstracts were imported into EndNote X7 (Clarivate Analytics). Publication titles were used to remove studies that were clearly not related to the scoping review purpose, were a summary of academic proceedings, or did not contain details of specific eHealth interventions.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The reasons for exclusion were recorded (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure1\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 1</a></span>). As the unit of data analysis was the eHealth intervention, articles that did not have basic information describing the intervention were excluded unless there were other publications about the same eHealth intervention with sufficient details. This included pamphlets and other gray literature found through reference mining of the full-text articles. An additional 8 articles were included, bringing the final number of articles to 42.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Abstracts were screened independently by 2 study authors. All the retained articles were retrieved as full-text articles and reviewed independently by 2 authors. Throughout the process, disagreements were resolved through discussion between the 2 reviewers and, at times, a third author.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Publications describing the same intervention in a different country or population were collapsed into a single unit of analysis, as were publications reporting on different aspects of the same study. This resulted in 23 digital health interventions to analyze. <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure2\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 2</a></span> illustrates the selection process using the PRISMA-ScR flow diagram [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref26\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<h4>Data Extraction and Analysis</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Data from multiple publications on the same study or intervention were combined, as well as information about the intervention available on the web, to extract the most comprehensive details of the eHealth intervention. Data were charted in table form for content related to year and country of publication, health conditions covered, theories mentioned, and age range of the children targeted by the interventions. The type of technology hardware used (eg, tablets and smartphones) was also recorded. Any references to the BCTTv1, the PSDM, or their related models and theories were noted.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A qualitative process of deductive content analysis [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref37\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></span>] of the extracted data occurred in iterative cycles of coding, refining codes and recoding to define the content, patterns, and relationships of each intervention’s active ingredients and features. Articles were coded in NVivo (version 12; QSR International) with matrix-coding queries used to look for relationships and patterns. The BCTTv1 and PSDM taxonomies were used as the codebook for this analysis. Therefore, tests of codebook reliability and validity were not considered necessary as codes were not added or removed. Definitions were clarified as needed throughout the coding process. Coders had varied previous experience and training. EJHS had previous experience applying the BCTTv1 in several projects [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref38\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref40\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></span>]. MS had no previous coding experience but undertook web-based training in BCT coding [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref41\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></span>] before starting this process. Where publications provided their own list of BCTs, these supplemented the retrospective codes identified but did not replace them.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Coding Development and Process</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Initially, 4 articles were read and coded independently by MS and JHS. The codes were discussed to reach an agreement on the definition and parameters of each code. As the definitions in the PSDM are not robust, the persuasive technology text [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref18\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></span>] and course notes from the behavior design guide workshop [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref42\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></span>] were used to supplement the understanding of PSDM coding use. Credibility was supported via both coders coding all articles independently and then discussing codes at weekly meetings where further refinements of code definitions were made and decision rules were documented. External advice from academic colleagues with expertise in the BCTTv1 and PSDM was sought once for each taxonomy when an agreement could not be reached between the 2 primary coders. A log of decisions that contributed to the final coding scheme was kept as an audit trail. Once all articles were coded and no further updates were made to the coding manual, all articles were uploaded into NVivo, reread, and recoded based on the final coding parameters.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Coding rules were expanded beyond the BCTTv1 guidelines when there was a lack of clarity regarding which of the 2 related codes to use. For example, if it was difficult to determine whether self-monitoring was directed at the behavior or the outcome, it was coded as both <i>Self-monitoring of behavior</i> and <i>Self-monitoring of outcome(s)</i>. Knowledge and education were a large part of most interventions but were often described with insufficient detail for BCT coding requirements. Text related to education, instruction, or the provision of knowledge was not coded unless it clearly adhered to a BCTTv1 definition given that research suggests that education and knowledge on their own do not change behavior [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref29\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref31\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></span>]. This contrasts with the approach taken by other authors, who coded any reference to education as <i>Information About Health Consequences</i> and <i>Instruction on How to Perform the Behavior</i> [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref28\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></span>]. All text was coded in this way before checking the supplementary material where BCTs were detailed by the publication authors. Where supplementary material was provided listing the BCTs, this was reviewed after coding, and any additional codes were added.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">NVivo queries were used to generate 3 matrix tables representing how the BCTs and PSD elements were represented in the data. The first table showed the number of times a BCT was coded with a PSD element (BCT-PSD pairs). The other 2 tables showed the number of times a BCT was coded with a different BCT (BCT-BCT pairs) or a PSD element was coded with a different PSD element (PSD-PSD pairs) in the same intervention. These matrix tables were exported to Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp) and enabled us to explore the relationship between BCTs and PSD elements as they were represented in the data.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">By definition, persuasive technology requires human-computer interaction where the technology can form a “relationship” with the user. In this scoping review, technology was considered an active participant in the intervention, taking part in a “relationship” with the parent. In <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure3\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 3</a></span>, the 2 arrows in the rectangle represent this relationship in a parent-focused eHealth intervention, which was the focus of this review.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Results\" data-label=\"Results\">Results</h3>\n",
       "<h4>Overview</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">This scoping review mapped 23 parent-focused eHealth interventions included in 42 articles published between 2009 and 2018. The most common study type in the included articles was randomized controlled trials (15/42, 36%). The next most common study types were cohort (5/42, 12%) and qualitative (4/42, 10%) studies. The publications also included mixed methods studies (2/42, 5%), co-design (2/42, 5%), case series studies (2/42, 5%), case-control studies (2/42, 5%), action research (1/42, 2%), and a randomized controlled trial protocol (1/42, 2%). The remainder of the published materials (8/42, 19%) included reports, pamphlets, and supplementary material such as tables and images of the digital intervention that were included if they detailed the intervention content for coding purposes (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table2\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 2</a></span>).</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The authors of the articles were from the United States (13/42, 31%); Australia (10/42, 24%); Europe (4/42, 10%); the United Kingdom (3/42, 7%); China, New Zealand, and Sweden (2/42, 5% per country); and Belgium, Canada, Israel, Italy, Japan, and Poland (1/42, 2% per country). The parent-focused eHealth interventions were delivered to parents with children ranging in age from 1 to 18 (mean 7, SD 5) years (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table3\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 3</a></span>).</p>\n",

       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">This scoping review mapped the theories, models, and taxonomies described in the included publications. Just over half (13/23, 57%) of the interventions mentioned a behavior change theory. Social-cognitive theory was the most frequently mentioned (6/23, 26%), followed by self-determination theory (3/23, 13%). Only 9% (2/23) of the interventions referenced PSD (CLKonline and Strongest Families FASD), and only 4% (1/23) of the interventions (Health Heroes) referred to the Behavior Change Wheel [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref78\" rel=\"footnote\">78</a></span>] as the overarching theory for the COM-B model and the BCTTv1. This was also the only publication that included supplementary information listing the BCTs in the intervention. No articles referenced the FBM.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Some interventions were established treatment approaches adapted for a web-based medium, for example, BraveOnline [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref48\" rel=\"footnote\">48</a></span>] and TPOL [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref70\" rel=\"footnote\">70</a></span>]. Other interventions were novel approaches designed specifically for the eHealth intervention, such as Sensory Treat [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref68\" rel=\"footnote\">68</a></span>] and Health Heroes [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref60\" rel=\"footnote\">60</a></span>]. Most interventions (19/23, 83%) used a web-based platform, with 47% (9/19) of these also including a mobile phone or tablet. The remaining 17% (4/23) of the interventions were stand-alone mobile phone or tablet apps. The most popular features included in the interventions were interactive questionnaires and charts (17/23, 74%), followed by instructional videos (14/23, 61%).</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Consistent with a focus on parents, all the included eHealth interventions (23/23, 100%) had the parent as the primary user, with the child (either the child’s behavior, health, or both) as the outcome target. The parent interacted directly with the digital platform, which could be linked to an intervention team, a preprogrammed intervention package (eg, a digital app), or a combination (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure3\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 3</a></span>). Thus, the active ingredients and intervention features (ie, BCTs and PSD elements) coded in this review were those directed toward the parent, whose behavior change affected their child’s health and behavioral outcomes. However, multiple relationships could exist in any one intervention such as targeting the child or other family members as intervention users. In addition, intervention descriptions in the publication text were often focused on the parent-child interaction rather than describing the human-computer interaction between the digital intervention and the parent.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The following extract from the scoping review data set illustrates how this attention to who was being targeted influenced the coding process. In an eHealth intervention supporting parents in implementing activity schedules for children with autism spectrum disorder, the following text was coded:</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">If the child were the target, coding would have captured techniques and elements such as <i>Prompts and Cues</i>, <i>Restructuring the Environment</i>, and <i>Information</i><i>and</i><i>Problem Solving</i>. However, as the directional relationship was from the digital intervention to the parent, this extract was coded as the BCT <i>Instructions on How to Perform a Behaviour</i> and the PSD element <i>Educational Coaching</i>.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Active Ingredients and Intervention Features: BCTs and PSD Elements</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The total PSD elements and BCTs coded using NVivo were analyzed by generating NVivo matrix queries to explore the patterns of BCT and PSD use visually. Microsoft Excel graphs were generated from the data. Commonly used codes and categories of the BCTTv1 and PSDM (density and frequency) were explored, along with how the use of theory influenced the active ingredients and intervention features. We referred back to the original definitions of persuasive design principles [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref18\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></span>] to compare elements and techniques that have been suggested as appropriate to merge [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref10\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></span>, <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref12\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></span>]. We found the data coded with each BCT or PSD element to be conceptually different, and no BCTs or PSD elements were found to always represent the same construct. <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table5\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 5</a></span> provides one example from the dataset comparing a BCT and PSD element that has previously been suggested [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref12\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></span>] as appropriate to merge.</p>\n",

       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\"><span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure4\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 4</a></span> shows how many active ingredients and intervention features were included in an intervention (coding density). A BCT or PSD element was counted once per intervention even if it was mentioned in several sections of the publication, in the supplementary material, or in 2 separate publications on the same intervention. Similarly, if the BCT or PSD element was implemented in different ways, it was also only counted once. For example, if the BCT <i>Feedback on behavior</i> was represented by a feedback graph and an evaluative email for the same intervention, it was counted once.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">As there are 93 BCTs compared with 32 PSD elements, the interventions with the highest number of BCTs coded also had the most active ingredients and intervention features (combined BCTs and PSD elements) coded in total.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The BCTs most frequently represented were for learning a behavioral skill, practicing it, and self-monitoring the behavior and its outcomes; codes were <i>Behavioural Practice</i> and <i>Instructions on How to Perform a Behaviour</i>, <i>Self-Monitoring (Behaviour)</i> and <i>Self-Monitoring (Outcomes</i>; 17/23, 74% each), followed closely by <i>Demonstration of the Behaviour</i> and <i>Action Planning</i> (16/23, 70% each).</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The PSD element most frequently coded was <i>Tailoring</i> the approach to parents was observed in every intervention (23/23, 100%). <i>Educational Coaching</i> (22/23, 96%), <i>Personalisation</i> (21/23, 91%), and <i>Suggestion</i> (20/23, 87%) were also highly represented.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The intervention My Child’s Asthma [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref65\" rel=\"footnote\">65</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref66\" rel=\"footnote\">66</a></span>] was the only intervention that was coded for the PSD element goal setting. In this intervention, parents were supported in setting goals regarding asthma controller use and other aspects of asthma care by the system providing a list of suggested goals. Goals were populated in response to the parents’ previous reports on adherence, outcome expectations, and self-efficacy. For example, if parents reported not believing that controllers worked as the primary reason why they were not using them, they were presented with information about asthma controller efficacy. If parents believed that controllers worked but reported that they could not remember to use them, they were provided with goals related to remembering to dispense controllers more consistently.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Both the BCTTv1 and PSDM use broader categories (behavior determinants and design principles, respectively) to group the BCTs and PSD elements. The BCTTv1 has 16 categories, and the PSDM has 5. A matrix table was used to count the number of active ingredients and features coded for each intervention per category. <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table6\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 6</a></span> provides an example of the BCTTv1 category <i>Goals and Planning</i> from this matrix table. Each column shows the number of interventions that included an active ingredient. Each row shows the number of active ingredients and features coded per intervention.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\"><span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table6\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 6</a></span> illustrates how the category Goals and Planning was frequently represented in the data set, with 91% (21/23) of the interventions having at least one active ingredient in this category, although very few of the active ingredients from the Goals and Planning category were actually coded in the data set. The table shows that BCTs 1.5 to 1.9 were coded in less than a quarter of the interventions, with Behavioral Contract not being coded in any. Therefore, the density of active ingredients was low, with only 29% of the possible active ingredients in this domain coded in the full data set.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\"><span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure5\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 5</a></span> illustrates the coding frequency and density across all the BCTTv1 and PSDM domains. A total of 43 BCTs from the full set of 93 were not coded in the data set. This included all the BCTs from 2 BCTTv1 categories (<i>Scheduled Consequences</i> and <i>Covert Learning</i>) that were therefore not represented at all in the data set. All the PSDM categories were represented by at least one active ingredient coded in the data set. A total of 94% (30/32) of the PSD elements were coded at least once. The 6% (2/32) of PSD elements that were not coded (<i>Social Comparison</i> and <i>Recognition</i>) were from the <i>Social Support</i> category. No category had a complete set of active ingredients and intervention features within that category coded in the data set. <i>Task Support</i> was the most densely coded category in the PSDM (97/161, 60.2%), and <i>Feedback and Monitoring</i> was the most densely coded category in the BCTTv1 (71/161, 44.1%).</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Coding by category was not representative of the active ingredients and features used in an intervention. For example, the BCTTv1 category <i>Repetition and Substitution</i> was the third most frequently represented BCTTv1 category (20/23, 87%); however, only 1 BCT (<i>Behavioural Practice</i>) was frequently coded (17/23, 74%). The only other technique coded from this category (<i>Graded Tasks</i>) was observed in 13% (3/23) of the interventions. The remaining 5 active ingredients in the <i>Repetition and Substitution</i> category were not coded at all in the data set, making it a high-frequency (19/23, 83%), low-density (20/161, 12.4%) category. Similar patterns were observed across the PSDM categories, as shown in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure5\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 5</a></span>.</p>\n",

       "<h4>Pairing of BCTs and PSD Elements</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Next, we examined the overlap or interaction between BCTs and PSD elements using the BCT-PSD matrix table. An example of this table is illustrated in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table7\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 7</a></span>, which is a snapshot of the full BCT-PSD matrix table. For example, the BCTs goal setting, action planning, and problem-solving were frequently paired with PSD elements reduction, suggestions, and educational coaching. However, we observed that the more times each ingredient was coded, the greater the “scatter” of the BCT-PSD pairings. For example, the BCT <i>Instructions on How to Perform a Behaviour</i> was coded with a PSD element 142 times, representing 20 different PSD elements. Similarly, the PSD element <i>Tailoring</i> was paired with a BCT 200 times during the coding process, and these pairings included 33 different BCTs.</p>\n",

       "<h4>Principal Findings</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The aim of this scoping review was to explore how the BCTTv1 and PSDM define parent-focused eHealth individually and in combination. Active ingredients and intervention features (BCTs and PSD elements) were coded in a data set of parent-focused eHealth literature and used to explore how these 2 taxonomies overlap and interact. The predominant active ingredients and intervention features found in parent-focused eHealth were concerned with teaching parents behavioral skills, encouraging them to practice and monitor the new skills, and tracking the outcomes of performing the new skills. The 2 taxonomies conceptually captured different constructs even when their labels appeared to overlap in meaning. In this section, the importance of clarifying directional relationships and intended targets before coding is highlighted first as an essential consideration. Coding accuracy and the implications of merging or condensing codes are then discussed, and the design implications for parent-focused eHealth are explored.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The focus of the interventions described in the parent-focused eHealth data set was primarily on the child despite the intervention’s intention to elicit a desired behavior from the parent. Parenting behaviors were often poorly defined or merely implied in the text. The importance of identifying the intended direction of interaction in a parent-focused intervention to improve reporting and coding accuracy was apparent in this scoping review analysis and has been similarly noted in another recent systematic review of digital behavior change interventions in children with chronic health conditions [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref79\" rel=\"footnote\">79</a></span>]. The target of the human-computer interaction (ie, the directional relationship) matters in parent-focused eHealth research, where each member of the triad of parent, child, and intervention participants interacts differently with the intervention. Therefore, in parent-focused eHealth, where the intervention targets the parent to improve child outcomes, careful attention to the directional relationship of the active ingredient or intervention feature being described is needed to mitigate errors in coding.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">In this scoping review, the number of parent-focused eHealth interventions that referenced a theoretical basis or model underpinning their design (14/23, 61%) was similar to that of other published reviews. On average, approximately half of all publications in the health behavior change and persuasive technology literature have an explicit theoretical basis [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref6\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref80\" rel=\"footnote\">80</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref81\" rel=\"footnote\">81</a></span>]. Similar to this scoping review, a previous systematic quantitative content analysis [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref80\" rel=\"footnote\">80</a></span>] reported that social-cognitive theories were referenced most often (7/14. 50%), followed by self-determination theories (3/14, 21%). Only 13% (3/23) of the interventions included in this scoping review mentioned either the PSDM or the BCTTv1 and the COM-B. None mentioned the FBM. Therefore, there were not enough data for any conclusions to be drawn on the existing use of these particular taxonomies in parent-focused eHealth.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Discrepancies in coding clarity and accuracy are a known issue resulting from the limited space for comprehensive reporting of the active ingredients and intervention features, ambiguity in the description of the intervention, or coders’ skill [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref13\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref14\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></span>]. This was highlighted during the coding process with the Health Heroes intervention [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref60\" rel=\"footnote\">60</a></span>]. As the only intervention with a supplementary list of BCTs provided, it enabled us to compare our retrospective coding with the researchers’ list of BCTs. We found that some of the active ingredients listed in the supplementary material were not clearly described in the text, and our interpretation of the text during our retrospective coding did not always match the provided list of BCTs. This points to the importance of having supplementary lists provided by the intervention designers to improve coding accuracy in research. However, retrospective coding was still found to be useful as we identified several BCTs that were not mapped in the supplementary material. It has been noted that features may have more than one function that may not have been anticipated in the original intervention design [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref60\" rel=\"footnote\">60</a></span>], and the combination of ingredients and elements may interact in ways that may increase or decrease the effectiveness of an eHealth intervention [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref82\" rel=\"footnote\">82</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref83\" rel=\"footnote\">83</a></span>]. Therefore, both prospective and retrospective coding may be necessary to comprehensively identify intervention ingredients for clarity and accuracy in reporting and research.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Some reviews have simplified the coding of eHealth by using the categories rather than the BCTs or PSD elements. There are 16 behavioral determinants and 5 design principles as compared with the 93 BCTs and 32 PSD elements. We found that categories did not always represent the active ingredients and intervention features in an intervention well. An intervention could have many BCTs or PSD elements or only 1 element representing a category, providing an inaccurate representation of what ingredients or features actively contributed to an intervention effect. Coding by category could miss important active ingredients and intervention features and negatively affect future research related to adapting or understanding intervention effectiveness.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Combining elements and techniques in the PSDM and BCTTv1 to create a merged taxonomy has also been noted in the literature to improve coding efficiency [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref10\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref12\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></span>], for example, merging the PSDs elements <i>Similarity, Personalisation</i>, and <i>Liking</i> into 1 code or merging the PSD element <i>Tunnelling</i> with the BCT <i>Instructions on How to Perform a Behavior.</i> Our coding analysis did not support this approach. No BCTs or PSD elements were found to always represent the same construct, particularly when referring back to the original taxonomy definitions [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref18\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Instructions on using the BCTTv1 [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref41\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></span>] specifically caution against coding based on a name rather than a description. Similar instructions are missing for the PSDM, which could improve coding accuracy for researchers, particularly as words commonly used to describe eHealth features in the text do not necessarily represent the intended construct represented by that word in the PSDM. For example, <i>Personalisation</i> and <i>Tailoring</i> are words used interchangeably but have different definitions in the PSDM. The following text was coded as <i>Personalisation</i> despite being described as tailoring:</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">This example highlights the need for clear instructions to standardize retrospective coding using taxonomies. The original conceptual article for the PSDM [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref3\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></span>] only provides short definitions for PSD elements. Other authors have suggested that PSD elements be coded only when there is evidence of human-computer interaction related to the description, for example, only coding <i>Dialogue Support</i> when the technology provides a praising message, not when a feedback message from a care provider contains praise [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref5\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></span>]. As we also applied this rule to our coding, the PSD element <i>Goal setting</i> was only coded when an interactive activity with the computer assisted in setting the goal. Only 4% (1/23) of the interventions out of the whole data set included a PSD element for goal setting (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app2\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 2</a></span>). In comparison, goal setting from the BCTTv1 was coded in nearly half of the interventions (<i>Goal setting [behavior]</i>: 10/23, 43%; <i>Goal setting [outcome]</i>: 8/23, 35%; <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app3\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 3</a></span>).</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">These findings suggest that taxonomies should not be merged based on similar labels or assumed constructs. Using goal setting as an example, the benefits of individualizing goals (BCT) over preselected goals (PSD) cannot be assumed. The literature points toward some parents finding it stressful to imagine goals for their child and preferring preselected goals [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref84\" rel=\"footnote\">84</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">We found constructs that appeared similar but used different labels and codes that used similar labels but represented different constructs. However, no labels within or between the taxonomies were consistently coded together. Similar-sounding labels or constructs represent different user experiences that may support different outcomes. Coding with broader categories or merging labels and constructs between BCTTv1 and PSDM taxonomies may improve efficiency but miss important differences in researching and understanding the effect of active ingredients and features in interventions.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Commonly used ingredients and features do not necessarily represent the most effective active ingredients and features. In this scoping review, the most common PSD elements coded were <i>Tailoring, Personalisation, eCoaching, Suggestion</i>, and <i>Reduction</i>. <i>Educational Coaching</i> (providing knowledge about the target behavior) and <i>Suggestion</i> (suggesting that users carry out the target behavior) were also frequently included. The most frequent BCTs coded addressed advice and demonstration on how to perform a behavior, prompted practice or rehearsal of a behavior, and monitored and provided feedback on behavior and action planning. This implies that digital interventions addressing parent-focused eHealth are tailored toward family needs and interests, simplifying tasks and individualizing the intervention. The predominant active ingredients and intervention features in parent-focused eHealth were concerned with teaching parents behavioral skills, encouraging them to practice and monitor the new skills, and tracking the outcomes of performing the new skills to improve skill and capacity in parents supporting their children’s health and behavior needs. In a separate systematic review of health and well-being apps for behavior change [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref85\" rel=\"footnote\">85</a></span>], similar BCTs for practice or rehearsal, self-monitoring, and prompts or reminders were reported as the most common. Health app users reported positively on the content and use of these apps [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref81\" rel=\"footnote\">81</a></span>]. However, there is limited evidence that they are the most effective in changing health or behavior [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref86\" rel=\"footnote\">86</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Of the 125 combined BCTs and PSD elements that could have potentially been coded in the 23 interventions represented in this scoping review, 40% (50/125) were not represented in the text (n=48, 38.4% BCTs and n=2, 1.6% PSD elements). The following BCTs that may be effective in sustaining new behaviors or developing new habits were not included in any of the parent-focused eHealth interventions included in this review: <i>Habit Formation</i>, <i>Valued Self-Identity</i>, <i>Identity</i><i>Associated with Changed Behaviour</i>, and <i>Focus on Past Success</i>. Similarly, the PSD elements <i>Social Comparison</i> and <i>Recognition</i> were not coded in any intervention despite their potential for effectively persuading behavior change through social influence. Exploring BCTs and PSD elements that are less familiar may be helpful for increasing parent-focused eHealth effectiveness. These less commonly used BCTs and PSD elements have been used successfully in other apps. For example, Runkeeper is a health and fitness app where runners can post their workouts and compare them with those of selected friends (social comparison), and Fitocracy is a digital health and fitness app that publishes the names of people who have achieved fitness milestones on the website’s fan page (recognition) [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref87\" rel=\"footnote\">87</a></span>]. Even BCTs that seem negative and incompatible with parent-focused eHealth, such as the BCTs <i>Future Punishment</i> and <i>Imaginary Punishment</i>, have been used effectively in other health apps. In a study looking at decreasing sedentary time by standing up, researchers found negative reinforcement to be more persuasive than constantly positive messaging. Negative reinforcement was described as showing a warning on the app if the user did not respond to the standing prompt. “Punishment” was applied using an avatar that became distressed and progressively more damaged in response to the user not standing when prompted [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref88\" rel=\"footnote\">88</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Designing interventions based predominantly on what is commonly found in existing interventions or what people say they want is a common and common-sense approach to designing eHealth interventions but may miss important subconscious and reflexive drivers of sustained health behavior change. Taxonomies provide a rich catalog of possible BCTs and persuasive elements that are yet to be explored fully in parent-focused eHealth. Designing eHealth interventions to intentionally test BCTs and PSD elements that are less common and familiar could lead to important insights into the usability and effectiveness of digital interventions to support parents of children with chronic health care needs.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Limitations</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">This scoping review only included English-language publications from before 2018. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in rapid shifts in web-based therapy provision that may not be described adequately in this review. However, capturing a decade of work before the COVID-19 pandemic also provides a useful baseline for future comparisons of change. In addition, the objective of this scoping review was to explore the utility of 2 taxonomies in defining the active ingredients and features of an intervention. The BCTTv1 and PSDM have not been updated since 2017. The data from the included articles provided sufficient information to ascertain the value of using both taxonomies in their entirety rather than merging or condensing them, as has occurred in other publications. Retrospective coding of publications based on taxonomy definitions was noted to be prone to errors, as has been reported elsewhere [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref14\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref89\" rel=\"footnote\">89</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref90\" rel=\"footnote\">90</a></span>]. Similar errors may have occurred during our coding process. Explanations as to how we interpreted definitions have been included in the <i>Methods</i> section to increase transparency and decrease ambiguity where possible.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Comparison With Related Reviews</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">A total of 3 other scoping reviews related to the scope of this review have been published previously [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref91\" rel=\"footnote\">91</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref93\" rel=\"footnote\">93</a></span>]. These publications did not address the objectives of this scoping review to map the active ingredients and intervention features in parent-focused eHealth and explore the use of both taxonomies. Greffin and Barros [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref91\" rel=\"footnote\">91</a></span>] investigated health-related parenting but did not address active ingredients and intervention features of behavior change and persuasive technology. Bradshaw et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref92\" rel=\"footnote\">92</a></span>] reviewed behavior change in parent-focused interventions but did not limit their review to eHealth and did not review persuasive technology. Asbjørnsen et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref93\" rel=\"footnote\">93</a></span>] looked at both behavior change and persuasive technology; however, the focus was on weight loss maintenance in adults. In addition, the authors used the 16 BCTTv1 categories rather than coding all 93 BCTs.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Conclusions</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The 2 taxonomies representing behavior change and persuasive technology were found to code different constructs, discouraging merging or reduction. Merging taxonomies may fail to capture the persuasive ingredients inherent in technology, missing the unique role of technology in creating bonding relationships with the end user. Using both taxonomies to code interventions in this scoping review was useful in providing a comprehensive description of the active ingredients and features of an eHealth intervention. However, it is important to note that potential coding errors may render the accuracy of the description uncertain. Coding errors may result from limited space for comprehensive reporting of the active ingredients and intervention features or from ambiguity in the publications’ description of ingredients, features, behavior targets, and outcomes.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Commonly found BCTs and PSD elements did not necessarily represent the best BCTs or PSD elements to use, with some potentially impactful codes not being used at all in the parent-focused eHealth data set. Despite the time-consuming and cumbersome task of capturing all BCTs and PSD elements, identifying each of these constructs enables a much richer description of the ingredients within the interventions as well as providing opportunities to consider innovative approaches in future designs. This scoping review highlighted the need for supplementary material detailing the active ingredients and intervention features in publications and the benefit of using 2 taxonomies to address both behavior change and persuasive technology that together influence the experience and behaviors of the people using the technology.</p>\n",

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Background: </span>Although social media has the potential to spread misinformation, it can also be a valuable tool for elucidating the social factors that contribute to the onset of negative beliefs. As a result, data mining has become a widely used technique in infodemiology and infoveillance research to combat misinformation effects. On the other hand, there is a lack of studies that specifically aim to investigate misinformation about fluoride on Twitter. Web-based individual concerns on the side effects of fluoridated oral care products and tap water stimulate the emergence and propagation of convictions that boost antifluoridation activism. In this sense, a previous content analysis–driven study demonstrated that the term <i>fluoride-free</i> was frequently associated with antifluoridation interests.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>This study aimed to analyze “fluoride-free” tweets regarding their topics and frequency of publication over time.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>A total of 21,169 tweets published in English between May 2016 and May 2022 that included the keyword “fluoride-free” were retrieved by the Twitter application programming interface. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling was applied to identify the salient terms and topics. The similarity between topics was calculated through an intertopic distance map. Moreover, an investigator manually assessed a sample of tweets depicting each of the most representative word groups that determined specific issues. Lastly, additional data visualization was performed regarding the total count of each topic of fluoride-free record and its relevance over time, using Elastic Stack software.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>We identified 3 issues by applying the LDA topic modeling: “healthy lifestyle” (topic 1), “consumption of natural/organic oral care products” (topic 2), and “recommendations for using fluoride-free products/measures” (topic 3). Topic 1 was related to users’ concerns about leading a healthier lifestyle and the potential impacts of fluoride consumption, including its hypothetical toxicity. Complementarily, topic 2 was associated with users’ personal interests and perceptions of consuming natural and organic fluoride-free oral care products, whereas topic 3 was linked to users’ recommendations for using fluoride-free products (eg, switching from fluoridated toothpaste to fluoride-free alternatives) and measures (eg, consuming unfluoridated bottled water instead of fluoridated tap water), comprising the propaganda of dental products. Additionally, the count of tweets on fluoride-free content decreased between 2016 and 2019 but increased again from 2020 onward.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>Public concerns toward a healthy lifestyle, including the adoption of natural and organic cosmetics, seem to be the main motivation of the recent increase of “fluoride-free” tweets, which can be boosted by the propagation of fluoride falsehoods on the web. Therefore, public health authorities, health professionals, and legislators should be aware of the spread of fluoride-free content on social media to create and implement strategies against their potential health damage for the population.<br></p>\n",

       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Introduction\" data-label=\"Introduction\">Introduction</h3>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Social media have increasingly gained popularity as platforms for individuals and communities to seek and share health information. In that regard, Twitter boasts an impressive user base of approximately 368 million monthly active individuals who share a common interest in discussing common health topics, such as COVID-19, cancer, influenza, mental health, vaccination, and smoking [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref7\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></span>]. Although Twitter can be incredibly informative and engaging for health seekers, it can also be a breeding ground for misinformation [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref5\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></span>]. In this context, misinformation indicates an umbrella term covering a range of false or misleading content, such as misinformation, mal-information, disinformation, fake news, and conspiracy theories [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref8\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref12\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Although Twitter can contribute to spreading health falsehoods, it can also serve as a valuable tool for elucidating the social factors that contribute to the onset of negative beliefs. As a result, data mining has become a widely used technique in infodemiology and infoveillance research to combat misinformation effects [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref13\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref14\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></span>]. For example, screening COVID-19 vaccine misinformation on Twitter helped to identify the health beliefs associated with the antivaccination movement, which contributed to a better understanding of the factors relating to the prevalence and severity of cases in different countries [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref15\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></span>]. Moreover, the analysis of social media content can contribute to the development of artificial intelligence–based ecosystems to control the misinformation phenomenon [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref16\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref17\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></span>]. Previously, content analysis on social media required manual characterization, but now, machine learning models can also be used to analyze large data sets.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Since its introduction in 1942, multiple studies have consistently demonstrated the role of fluoride in reducing the prevalence and incidence of caries lesions [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref18\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></span>]. There is robust evidence that fluoride interventions, including the fluoridation of tap water, the use of fluoride-containing oral care products, and professional fluoride application, promote favorable health outcomes [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref19\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref22\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></span>]. The prevalence of dental caries has decreased drastically among people from communities exposed to these preventive, cost-effective measures [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref20\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref23\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></span>]. One concern surrounding fluoride use is that overexposure, specifically during tooth development stages, increases the chance of dental fluorosis in children [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref24\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></span>]. Thus, dentists recommend the adoption of safeguard measures for the storage and use of fluoride-containing products, such as keeping them in a secure place out of children’s reach, reducing the amount of toothpaste during tooth brushing, and avoiding fluoridated solutions with pleasant flavors [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref19\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref25\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></span>]. This safety consideration, in conjunction with misinformation that fluoride causes neurological disorders, has flooded the internet with erroneous beliefs on the poisoning capacity of fluoride [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref26\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref27\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></span>]. This spread of misinformation has contributed to a public refusal to use fluoride to control dental caries [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref16\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref28\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></span>]. Specifically, a previous content analysis–driven study demonstrated that the term <i>fluoride-free</i> was frequently associated with antifluoridation interests on social media [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref16\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">In view of possible negative implications of web-based fluoride content, this study aimed to analyze “fluoride-free” tweets regarding their topics and frequency of publication over time.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Methods\" data-label=\"Methods\">Methods</h3>\n",
       "<h4>Ethical Considerations</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">This study did not require institutional review board approval from the Council of Ethics in Human Research of the University of Waterloo because federal regulations do not apply to research using publicly available data that do not involve human subjects.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Data Collection</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">On June 5, 2022, the Twitter application programming interface [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref29\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></span>] was used to extract 23,436 tweets published in English between May 2016 and May 2022 with the keyword “fluoride-free.” It followed the parameters of a prior study about fluoride-related misinformation on Instagram [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref16\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<h4>Preprocessing of the Data Set</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The CSV file data set was uploaded and processed to enhance the quality of the tweets for subsequent analysis [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref30\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></span>]. Initially, duplicate tweets were identified and eliminated, resulting in a data set containing 21,169 unique tweets. Next, tokenization was performed to break down the text into smaller units, such as individual words. Then, all tokens were converted to lowercase to ensure uniform treatment, irrespective of capitalization, and to prevent potential discrepancies in the analysis. Stop words were removed to eliminate common words that contribute little meaning to the analysis. This included articles (eg, “a,” “an,” and “the”), prepositions (eg, “on,” “in,” and “at”), and conjunctions (eg, “and,” “but,” and “or”). Additionally, unspecific or irrelevant words were removed, such as non-English characters, keywords, verbs, and digits. Lastly, punctuation marks, symbols, and special characters were eliminated to refine the data set further and ensure consistency in subsequent analysis.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Furthermore, exploratory data preprocessing was performed to assess the impact of both the most frequent and rare words in the data set. Notably, term frequency filtering did not exhibit substantial improvements on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling. Therefore, the decision was made to retain the most frequent and rare words to enhance the contextual relevance of the resulting topics (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#app1\" rel=\"footnote\">Multimedia Appendix 1</a></span>).</p>\n",
       "<h4>Data Analyses</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">LDA topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning probabilistic and word count–based algorithm used to effectively determine salient terms and extract emerging groups (topics) of a particular corpus (data set), including social media posts concerning health issues [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref31\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref32\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></span>]. Even though this analysis does not provide a complete meaning of social media posts, it contributes to a good overview of their main issues [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref33\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></span>]. Notably, a detailed description of the LDA model is provided elsewhere [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref34\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The preprocessed 21,169 tweets were subjected to LDA topic modeling techniques using the Python-based <i>Gensim</i> and <i>spaCy</i> libraries in a Google Colaboratory interface to identify the salient terms and topics [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref31\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref32\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></span>]. The number of ideal topics was defined according to the coherence score proposed by Nikolenko and colleagues [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref35\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">In this context, the coherence values were computed for <i>K</i> topics, where <i>K</i> ranged from 2 to 50, before eventually narrowing the consideration range down to 3 to 15 cases. Remarkably, higher coherence scores probabilistically represent better-quality topic modeling, facilitating the interpretation of outputs. An investigator (ML) validated the topic model with the highest coherence score by rating the model on the meaningfulness of its topics, how well publications within a single topic are related, and how publications of different topics are distinct.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Facing the definition of the number of topics, the similarity between them was calculated through an intertopic distance map. It is a visualization of the issues in a bidimensional space, where the bubbles represent topics that emerged from the topic modeling analysis and are dimensionally proportional to the number of contained words. In this graph representation, the axes are based on 2 principal components to facilitate the interpretation of the distance between topics. Synthetically, the LDA algorithm uses a principal component analysis to reduce N-dimensional vectors to bidimensional vectors and achieve (<i>x,y</i>) coordinates.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Moreover, the same investigator (ML) manually assessed a sample of tweets depicting each of the most representative word groups that determined specific issues. Lastly, additional data visualization was performed regarding the total count of each topic of fluoride-free record and its relevance over time, using Elastic Stack software through the Elasticsearch and Kibana features [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref36\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref38\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Results\" data-label=\"Results\">Results</h3>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">To determine the underlying social issues surrounding the spread of fluoride-free content on Twitter, we applied topic modeling to identify patterns based on the frequency of keywords [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref29\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref30\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></span>]. A higher coherence score is associated with better data quality and simplified output interpretation. The highest coherence value (0.543) occurred for 3 topics (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure1\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 1</a></span>). This indicated that the Twitter posts contained 3 different fluoride-free–related topics.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Using an intertopic distance map (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure2\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 2</a></span>), we visualized the arrangement of topics based on the words they comprise. The analysis revealed a distance between the topics, confirming the identification of 3 distinct issues: “healthy lifestyle” (topic 1), “consumption of natural/organic oral care products” (topic 2), and “recommendations for using fluoride-free products/measures” (topic 3). In this sense, topic 1 was related to users’ concerns about leading a healthier lifestyle and the potential impacts of fluoride consumption, including its hypothetical toxicity. Complementarily, topic 2 was associated with users’ personal interests and perceptions of consuming natural and organic fluoride-free oral care products, whereas topic 3 was linked to users’ recommendations for using fluoride-free products (eg, switching from fluoridated toothpaste to fluoride-free alternatives) and measures (eg, consuming unfluoridated bottled water instead of fluoridated tap water), comprising the propaganda of dental products.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\"><span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#table1\" rel=\"footnote\">Table 1</a></span> summarizes the fluoride-free salient topics stratified according to the most frequent words, issues, and examples. It is important to note that some words appear in 2 topics, for example, “tooth” in topics 2 and 3. The homogeneity of the data set can explain this pattern since tweets were collected from a keyword that restricts the results to a specific theme. Moreover, some words per se do not directly represent the issue of the topic, such as “long” or “black” in topic 1 (healthy lifestyle). Thus, the context of tweets is essential to define the issue of emerging topics in both cases. As a result, the analysis of a sample of tweets from each topic was necessary to ensure the distinction between issues presented within the topics.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">To determine the frequency that each “fluoride-free” topic appears on Twitter, we calculated the percentage (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure3\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 3</a></span>) and absolute count (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure4\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 4</a></span>) of each topic over time. Topic 1 (healthy lifestyle) represents the largest share of tweets, whereas topics 2 (consumption of natural/organic oral care products) and 3 (recommendations for using fluoride-free products/measures) are similar in terms of their representation (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure3\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 3</a></span>). Between 2016 and 2019, a gradual decline in “fluoride-free” tweets was observed, reaching &lt;2000 tweets per year (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure4\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 4</a></span>). Nonetheless, the number of tweets increased again from 2020 onward.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The relevance of each topic was determined by the number of tweets over time. The points of each curve are separated by a 4-week interval (<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure5\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 5</a></span>). The number of tweets from topic 1 (healthy lifestyle) was higher than other topics, particularly in 2016, 2017, 2021, and 2022. The relevance of topics 2 (consumption of natural/organic oral care products) and 3 (recommendations for using fluoride-free products/measures) was similar over time, with a slight advantage for topic 2 in 2018.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Discussion\" data-label=\"Discussion\">Discussion</h3>\n",
       "<h4>Principal Findings</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The purpose of this study was to analyze the fluoride-free content on Twitter. Although studies have investigated fluoride-related content on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref16\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref28\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref39\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref42\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></span>], to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that focused on fluoride-free content on Twitter using topic modeling methods. The findings demonstrated that fluoride-free content found on Twitter mainly concerned a perceived healthy lifestyle, followed by the consumption of natural and organic oral care products and recommendations of fluoride-free products and measures. The outcomes are in accordance with previous studies [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref16\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref28\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref39\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></span>-<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref42\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></span>]. We found that the interest in falsehoods gradually decreased between 2016 and 2019 and subsequently rose again from 2020 onward. The use of topic modeling analysis enabled the examination of a large Twitter data set, which would be difficult to achieve with traditional human-based analysis. In this sense, developing artificial intelligence–grounded systems capable of detecting and analyzing a massive volume of fluoride-related misinformation is essential.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Despite a decline in “fluoride-free” tweets between 2016 and 2019, the antifluoridation movement has had a negative impact on dental public policies in English-speaking countries. This has led to some regions discontinuing community water fluoridation to meet specific demands of users, despite community-based intervention being a key factor in promoting oral health equity [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref43\" rel=\"footnote\">43</a></span>]. For example, in Canada, only approximately 39% of the population has access to fluoridated tap water, with uneven distribution across the country (71% living in Ontario vs 1.7% living in British Columbia) [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref44\" rel=\"footnote\">44</a></span>]. Research has shown that dental caries prevalence is significantly higher in areas where fluoridation has been discontinued. An observational study conducted on schoolchildren in Alberta found that dental caries prevalence in primary dentition (ie, deciduous teeth and baby teeth) was significantly higher in Calgary (64.8%; fluoridation cessation in 2011) compared to Edmonton (55.1%; still fluoridated) [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref45\" rel=\"footnote\">45</a></span>]. In contrast, oral care companies have developed fluoride-free products to meet consumers’ preferences [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref16\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref46\" rel=\"footnote\">46</a></span>]. Interestingly, the increase in “fluoride-free” tweets in 2020 coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The infodemic scenario during the pandemic has led to increased health information-seeking behavior among users, including dental-related issues [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref47\" rel=\"footnote\">47</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref48\" rel=\"footnote\">48</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">False health beliefs usually originate from the same mechanisms of accurate health beliefs, influenced by diverse cognitive, social, and affective drivers such as intuitive thinking (the absence of analytical thinking or deliberation), cognitive failures (neglecting or forgetting sources and evidence), illusory truth (familiarity, fluency, and cohesion), reliance on source cues (elites, in-group, and attractive), emotion (emotive content and emotional state), and worldview (personal views and partisanship) [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref49\" rel=\"footnote\">49</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref50\" rel=\"footnote\">50</a></span>]. Notably, users tend to uncritically interact with posts associated with their health beliefs, reinforcing the genesis of echo chambers on social media [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref51\" rel=\"footnote\">51</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref52\" rel=\"footnote\">52</a></span>]. This scenario propitiates the emergence of denialist groups, characterized by their high level of engagement with health misinformation publications. In this context, anti–community water fluoridation groups’ digital activity exceeds those of their counterparts by 60 times [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref40\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></span>]. In addition, developing health beliefs have a significant association with lifestyle and impacts on its changes [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref53\" rel=\"footnote\">53</a></span>], which could explain the high demand for this topic in our study.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Practical Implications</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The findings may contribute to elaborating educational public health actions regarding eHealth and mobile health solutions, aiding communities in avoiding antifluoridation content on social media. Likewise, these results can orient fact-checking agencies to promptly clarify deceitful web-based publications about fluoride to their audience, addressing the concerns of users to support fluoride-containing measures. For example, issues concerning fluoride overexposure must be clarified, reinforcing safeguard actions for storing and using fluoridated products in early childhood [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref19\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref25\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></span>]. Certainly, the adoption of reliable web-based health information by users can enhance individual and shared decision-making, thus contributing to better health care outcomes [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref54\" rel=\"footnote\">54</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref55\" rel=\"footnote\">55</a></span>]. In this context, government agencies and organizations should be aware of the importance of investments in measures designed to improve the acquisition of information by the population [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref56\" rel=\"footnote\">56</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref57\" rel=\"footnote\">57</a></span>]. Moreover, artificial intelligence–based systems may support public health actions to mitigate the propagation of false fluoride content on the web. Specifically, these solutions can automatically label publications and down-promote them until an in-depth investigation by social media companies. With insight into the underlying social media issues surrounding antifluoridation content, health professionals can ensure adequate communication with their patients based on person-centered care principles [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref58\" rel=\"footnote\">58</a></span>]. Equally important, legislators must discuss resolutions to control the spread of misinformation, specifically the role and duties of users and social media managers. Since the antifluoridation movement is substantially present in contemporary society, fluoride refusal will frequently be reported in dental offices [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref28\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<h4>Limitations</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">This study has some limitations. First, we used only data from Twitter for the proposed analyses. As a result, the findings are influenced by platform characteristics (eg, limitation in the word count of posts), differentiating them from other social media. Despite that limitation, previous studies also focused on Twitter data to investigate health topics on social media because of the advantages relating to data collection and the number of active users [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref13\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref59\" rel=\"footnote\">59</a></span>]. Second, we collected the Twitter data set from a specific keyword, which may have limited the extrapolation of outcomes to all antifluoridation content. Nevertheless, we defined the search strategy and collected the data based on a previous fluoride misinformation study [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref16\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></span>]. Third, although the results indicate the need to control information disorder on Twitter more effectively, it is improbable that the company will modify its policies in this area due to recent changes in ownership. Fourth, trend analysis did not consider the influence of possible platform-related confounders, such as the increase or decrease in the overall number of tweets on Twitter or changes in the content moderation policy over time. However, trend patterns are likely more related to users’ interest in fluoride-free content than Twitter’s characteristics. Lastly, these findings were based only on English-language tweets, influencing the screening of fluoride-free content by cultural and regional aspects. In contrast, falsehoods tend to be found in English since it is the most spoken language in the world.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Conclusions</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The public concerns toward a healthy lifestyle, including the adoption of natural and organic oral care products, seem to be the main motivation of the recent increase of “fluoride-free” tweets, which can be boosted by the propagation of fluoride falsehoods noted on the web. Therefore, public health authorities, health professionals, and legislators should be aware of the spread of fluoride-free content on social media to create and implement strategies against their potential health damage for the population.</p>\n",

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Background: </span>Self-medication counseling in community pharmacies plays a crucial role in health care. Counseling advice should therefore be evidence-based. Web-based information and databases are commonly used as electronic information sources. EVInews is a self-medication–related information tool consisting of a database and monthly published newsletters for pharmacists. Little is known about the quality of pharmacists’ electronic information sources for evidence-based self-medication counseling.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>Our aim was to investigate the quality of community pharmacists’ web-based search results for self-medication–related content in comparison with the EVInews database, based on an adjusted quality score for pharmacists.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>After receiving ethics approval, we performed a quantitative web-based survey with a search task as a prospective randomized, controlled, and unblinded trial. For the search task, participants were instructed to search for evidence-based information to verify 6 health-related statements from 2 typical self-medication indications. Pharmacists across Germany were invited via email to participate. After providing written informed consent, they were automatically, randomly assigned to use either web-based information sources of their choice without the EVInews database (web group) or exclusively the EVInews database (EVInews group). The quality of the information sources that were used for the search task was then assessed by 2 evaluators using a quality score ranging from 100% (180 points, all predefined criteria fulfilled) to 0% (0 points, none of the predefined criteria fulfilled). In case of assessment discrepancies, an expert panel consisting of 4 pharmacists was consulted.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>In total, 141 pharmacists were enrolled. In the Web group (n=71 pharmacists), the median quality score was 32.8% (59.0 out of 180.0 points; IQR 23.0-80.5). In the EVInews group (n=70 pharmacists), the median quality score was significantly higher (85.3%; 153.5 out of 180.0 points; <i>P</i>&lt;.001) and the IQR was smaller (IQR 125.1-157.0). Fewer pharmacists completed the entire search task in the Web group (n=22) than in the EVInews group (n=46). The median time to complete the search task was not significantly different between the Web group (25.4 minutes) and the EVInews group (19.7 minutes; <i>P</i>=.12). The most frequently used web-based sources (74/254, 29.1%) comprised tertiary literature.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>The median quality score of the web group was poor, and there was a significant difference in quality scores in favor of the EVInews group. Pharmacists’ web-based and self-medication–related information sources often did not meet standard quality requirements and showed considerable variation in quality.<br></p>\n",

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Background: </span>To ensure the timely diagnosis of emerging infectious diseases, high-tech molecular biotechnology is often used to detect pathogens and has gradually become the gold standard for virological testing. However, beginners and students are often unable to practice their skills due to the higher costs associated with high-level virological testing, the increasing complexity of the equipment, and the limited number of specimens from patients. Therefore, a new training program is necessary to increase training and reduce the risk of test failure.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>The aim of the study is to (1) develop and implement a virtual reality (VR) software for simulated and interactive high-level virological testing that can be applied in clinical practice and skills building or training settings and (2) evaluate the VR simulation’s effectiveness on reaction, learning, and behavior of the students (trainees).<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>Viral nucleic acid tests on a BD MAX instrument were selected for our VR project because it is a high-tech automatic detection system. There was cooperation between teachers of medical technology and biomedical engineering. Medical technology teachers were responsible for designing the lesson plan, and the biomedical engineering personnel developed the VR software. We designed a novel VR teaching software to simulate cognitive learning via various procedure scenarios and interactive models. The VR software contains 2D VR “cognitive test and learning” lessons and 3D VR “practical skills training” lessons. We evaluated students’ learning effectiveness pre- and posttraining and then recorded their behavior patterns when answering questions, performing repeated exercises, and engaging in clinical practice.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>The results showed that the use of the VR software met participants’ needs and enhanced their interest in learning. The average posttraining scores of participants exposed to 2D and 3D VR training were significantly higher than participants who were exposed solely to traditional demonstration teaching (<i>P</i>&lt;.001). Behavioral assessments of students pre- and posttraining showed that students exposed to VR-based training to acquire relevant knowledge of advanced virological testing exhibited significantly improved knowledge of specific items posttraining (<i>P</i>&lt;.01). A higher participant score led to fewer attempts when responding to each item in a matching task. Thus, VR can enhance students’ understanding of difficult topics.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>The VR program designed for this study can reduce the costs associated with virological testing training, thus, increasing their accessibility for students and beginners. It can also reduce the risk of viral infections particularly during disease outbreaks (eg, the COVID-19 pandemic) and also enhance students’ learning motivation to strengthen their practical skills.<br></p>\n",

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Background: </span>Testicular sperm extraction (TESE) is an essential therapeutic tool for the management of male infertility. However, it is an invasive procedure with a success rate up to 50%. To date, no model based on clinical and laboratory parameters is sufficiently powerful to accurately predict the success of sperm retrieval in TESE.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>The aim of this study is to compare a wide range of predictive models under similar conditions for TESE outcomes in patients with nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) to identify the correct mathematical approach to apply, most appropriate study size, and relevance of the input biomarkers.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>We analyzed 201 patients who underwent TESE at Tenon Hospital (Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Sorbonne University, Paris), distributed in a retrospective training cohort of 175 patients (January 2012 to April 2021) and a prospective testing cohort (May 2021 to December 2021) of 26 patients. Preoperative data (according to the French standard exploration of male infertility, 16 variables) including urogenital history, hormonal data, genetic data, and TESE outcomes (representing the target variable) were collected. A TESE was considered positive if we obtained sufficient spermatozoa for intracytoplasmic sperm injection. After preprocessing the raw data, 8 machine learning (ML) models were trained and optimized on the retrospective training cohort data set: The hyperparameter tuning was performed by random search. Finally, the prospective testing cohort data set was used for the model evaluation. The metrics used to evaluate and compare the models were the following: sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), and accuracy. The importance of each variable in the model was assessed using the permutation feature importance technique, and the optimal number of patients to include in the study was assessed using the learning curve.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>The ensemble models, based on decision trees, showed the best performance, especially the random forest model, which yielded the following results: AUC=0.90, sensitivity=100%, and specificity=69.2%. Furthermore, a study size of 120 patients seemed sufficient to properly exploit the preoperative data in the modeling process, since increasing the number of patients beyond 120 during model training did not bring any performance improvement. Furthermore, inhibin B and a history of varicoceles exhibited the highest predictive capacity.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>An ML algorithm based on an appropriate approach can predict successful sperm retrieval in men with NOA undergoing TESE, with promising performance. However, although this study is consistent with the first step of this process, a subsequent formal prospective multicentric validation study should be undertaken before any clinical applications. As future work, we consider the use of recent and clinically relevant data sets (including seminal plasma biomarkers, especially noncoding RNAs, as markers of residual spermatogenesis in NOA patients) to improve our results even more.<br></p>\n",

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of a novel theoretically driven internet-based intervention for first-year college students who identify as women (RealConsent) in reducing their risk of exposure to SV and alcohol misuse as well as increasing alcohol protective and bystander behaviors.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>This randomized controlled trial involved first-year college students who identified as women (n=881) attending 1 of 3 universities in the southeastern United States. Participants aged 18 to 20 years were randomized to RealConsent (444/881, 50.4%) or to an attention-matched placebo control (437/881, 49.6%). RealConsent is fully automated and consists of four 45-minute modules that incorporate entertainment-education media and proven behavior change techniques. The primary outcome was exposure to SV; the secondary outcomes were alcohol protective behaviors, dating risk behaviors, alcohol misuse, and bystander behavior. Study outcomes were assessed at baseline and 6-month follow-up.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>Among participants with some exposure to SV, those in the RealConsent group experienced less exposure to SV than the placebo group (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.33-0.69; <i>P</i>=.002). Furthermore, participants in the RealConsent group engaged in more alcohol protective behaviors (adjusted odds ratio 1.17, 95% CI 0.12-2.22; <i>P</i>=.03) and were less likely to binge drink (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.67-0.97; <i>P</i>=.003). Finally, participants in the RealConsent group who had 100% dosage were more likely to engage in bystander behavior than those with &lt;100% dosage plus placebo group (adjusted odds ratio 1.72, 95% CI 1.17-2.55; <i>P</i>=.006).<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>A comprehensive exposure to SV, alcohol use, and bystander educational program was successful in decreasing the occurrence of exposure to SV among those most at risk and in increasing alcohol protective behaviors. Because of its web-based and mobile technologies, RealConsent can be easily disseminated and holds potential for reducing campus SV.<br></p>\n",

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Background: </span>Taxonomies and models are useful tools for defining eHealth content and intervention features, enabling comparison and analysis of research across studies and disciplines. The Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy version 1 (BCTTv1) was developed to decrease ambiguity in defining specific characteristics inherent in health interventions, but it was developed outside the context of digital technology. In contrast, the Persuasive System Design Model (PSDM) was developed to define and evaluate the persuasive content in software solutions but did not have a specific focus on health. Both the BCTTv1 and PSDM have been used to define eHealth interventions in the literature, with some researchers combining or reducing the taxonomies to simplify their application. It is unclear how well the taxonomies accurately define eHealth and whether they should be used alone or in combination.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>This scoping review explored how the BCTTv1 and PSDM capture the content and intervention features of parent-focused eHealth as part of a program of studies investigating the use of technology to support parents with therapy home programs for children with special health care needs. It explored the active ingredients and persuasive technology features commonly found in parent-focused eHealth interventions for children with special health care needs and how the descriptions overlap and interact with respect to the BCTTv1 and PSDM taxonomies.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>A scoping review was used to clarify concepts in the literature related to these taxonomies. Keywords related to parent-focused eHealth were defined and used to systematically search several electronic databases for parent-focused eHealth publications. Publications referencing the same intervention were combined to provide comprehensive intervention details. The data set was coded using codebooks developed from the taxonomies in NVivo (version 12; QSR International) and qualitatively analyzed using matrix queries.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>The systematic search found 23 parent-focused eHealth interventions described in 42 articles from various countries; delivered to parents with children aged 1 to 18 years; and covering medical, behavioral, and developmental issues. The predominant active ingredients and intervention features in parent-focused eHealth were concerned with teaching parents behavioral skills, encouraging them to practice and monitor the new skills, and tracking the outcomes of performing the new skills. No category had a complete set of active ingredients or intervention features coded. The two taxonomies conceptually captured different constructs even when their labels appeared to overlap in meaning. In addition, coding by category missed important active ingredients and intervention features.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>The taxonomies were found to code different constructs related to behavior change and persuasive technology, discouraging the merging or reduction of the taxonomies. This scoping review highlighted the benefit of using both taxonomies in their entirety to capture active ingredients and intervention features important for comparing and analyzing eHealth across different studies and disciplines.<br></p>\n",

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Background: </span>Although social media has the potential to spread misinformation, it can also be a valuable tool for elucidating the social factors that contribute to the onset of negative beliefs. As a result, data mining has become a widely used technique in infodemiology and infoveillance research to combat misinformation effects. On the other hand, there is a lack of studies that specifically aim to investigate misinformation about fluoride on Twitter. Web-based individual concerns on the side effects of fluoridated oral care products and tap water stimulate the emergence and propagation of convictions that boost antifluoridation activism. In this sense, a previous content analysis–driven study demonstrated that the term <i>fluoride-free</i> was frequently associated with antifluoridation interests.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>This study aimed to analyze “fluoride-free” tweets regarding their topics and frequency of publication over time.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>A total of 21,169 tweets published in English between May 2016 and May 2022 that included the keyword “fluoride-free” were retrieved by the Twitter application programming interface. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling was applied to identify the salient terms and topics. The similarity between topics was calculated through an intertopic distance map. Moreover, an investigator manually assessed a sample of tweets depicting each of the most representative word groups that determined specific issues. Lastly, additional data visualization was performed regarding the total count of each topic of fluoride-free record and its relevance over time, using Elastic Stack software.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>We identified 3 issues by applying the LDA topic modeling: “healthy lifestyle” (topic 1), “consumption of natural/organic oral care products” (topic 2), and “recommendations for using fluoride-free products/measures” (topic 3). Topic 1 was related to users’ concerns about leading a healthier lifestyle and the potential impacts of fluoride consumption, including its hypothetical toxicity. Complementarily, topic 2 was associated with users’ personal interests and perceptions of consuming natural and organic fluoride-free oral care products, whereas topic 3 was linked to users’ recommendations for using fluoride-free products (eg, switching from fluoridated toothpaste to fluoride-free alternatives) and measures (eg, consuming unfluoridated bottled water instead of fluoridated tap water), comprising the propaganda of dental products. Additionally, the count of tweets on fluoride-free content decreased between 2016 and 2019 but increased again from 2020 onward.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>Public concerns toward a healthy lifestyle, including the adoption of natural and organic cosmetics, seem to be the main motivation of the recent increase of “fluoride-free” tweets, which can be boosted by the propagation of fluoride falsehoods on the web. Therefore, public health authorities, health professionals, and legislators should be aware of the spread of fluoride-free content on social media to create and implement strategies against their potential health damage for the population.<br></p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Eligibility criteria</strong> We included international guidelines with one or more recommendations on hand hygiene in community settings—categorised as domestic, public or institutional—published by international organisations, in English or French, between 1 January 1990 and 15 November 2021.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Data sources</strong> To identify relevant guidelines, we searched the WHO Institutional Repository for Information Sharing Database, Google, websites of international organisations, and contacted expert organisations and individuals.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Charting methods</strong> Recommendations were mapped to four areas related to hand hygiene: (1) effective hand hygiene; (2) minimum requirements; (3) behaviour change and (4) government measures. Recommendations were assessed for consistency, concordance and whether supported by evidence.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> We identified 51 guidelines containing 923 recommendations published between 1999 and 2021 by multilateral agencies and international non-governmental organisations. Handwashing with soap is consistently recommended as the preferred method for hand hygiene across all community settings. Most guidelines specifically recommend handwashing with plain soap and running water for at least 20 s; single-use paper towels for hand drying; and alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) as a complement or alternative to handwashing. There are inconsistent and discordant recommendations for water quality for handwashing, affordable and effective alternatives to soap and ABHR, and the design of handwashing stations. There are gaps in recommendations on soap and water quantity, behaviour change approaches and government measures required for effective hand hygiene. Less than 10% of recommendations are supported by any cited evidence.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusion</strong> While current international guidelines consistently recommend handwashing with soap across community settings, there remain gaps in recommendations where clear evidence-based guidance might support more effective policy and investment.</p>\n",

Among analysed responses, 499 (34%) women reported currently using cannabis and 978 (66%) indicated ever using cannabis. Of the 499 current cannabis users, over 75% were using cannabis for medical purposes. Most common reasons for current use were sleep (65%), anxiety (45%) and muscle/joint achiness (33%). In current users, 74% indicated that cannabis was helpful for symptoms. Current cannabis users were more likely to report experiencing menopause symptoms compared with non-users. History of smoking and general health status were associated with current cannabis use.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> Some women are using cannabis for symptoms related to menopause. Further research is required to assess safety and efficacy of cannabis for managing menopause and develop clinical resources for women on cannabis and menopause.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objectives</strong> This review examined the factors influencing communication and engagement with ethnic and racial minority groups in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic. It aimed to answer two main questions: (1) what communication problems people from these communities typically faced during the pandemic? and (2) what strategies and recommendations were suggested to enhance communication and engagement for ethnic and racial minorities during the current COVID-19 pandemic and any similar events in the future?</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> Scoping review.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Data sources</strong> PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PsychINFO and CINAHL. Grey literature was searched within organisations’ websites and a Google search of key terms.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Eligibility criteria for selecting studies</strong> We included original research, case studies, reports (including government and charity reports), systematic and scoping articles and literature reviews in English, published from January 2020 to August 2022.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Data extraction and synthesis</strong> Two researchers independently assessed the literature for eligibility and extracted data from the included literature. The selected papers were analysed and summarised into themes relevant to the research questions. The final review included 38 studies combining published academic papers and grey literature.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> Key themes relating to communication and engagement issues included a lack of trust in authority, a lack of access to information and ineffective communication channels and a lack of timely and culturally responsive materials. To reduce the issues, the papers spoke about the key role of community organisations to provide local support and community leaders as trusted spokespersons. Lastly, key recommendations to reduce inequity and strengthen future pandemic responses focused on the need for collaborations and consultations, increasing the number of bilingual workers and supporting community-led communication efforts.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> The insights gained from the activities and experiences documented in this review during the COVID-19 pandemic should be incorporated into future decision-making and interventions to enhance communication and engagement strategies.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objectives</strong> To investigate incident cataract surgery and to investigate determinants of cataract surgery uptake in Chinese adults.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> This nationally representative longitudinal study recorded self-reported incident cataract surgery, and measured biological, clinical and socioeconomical characteristics at baseline and endline.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Setting</strong> In the first stage, 150 county-level units were randomly chosen with a probability-proportional-to-size sampling technique from a sampling frame containing all county-level units. The sample was stratified by region and within region by urban district or rural county and per capita gross domestic product. The final sample of 150 counties fell within 28 provinces of China.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Participants</strong> Urban and rural Chinese persons aged 45 years and older.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Primary and secondary outcome measures</strong> Incident cataract surgery (primary outcome) and the factors associated with incident cataract surgery (secondary outcome).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> Among 16 663 people enrolled in 2011, 13 705 (82.2%) attended follow-up in 2015. Among these, 167 (1.22%) reported incident cataract surgery. Those receiving surgery were significantly older (66.2±8.79 vs 58.3±9.18, p≤0.001) and more likely to report: illiteracy (44.9% vs 27.1%, p&lt;0.001), poor baseline distance vision (49.7% vs 20.0%, p≤0.001), poor baseline near vision (37.1% vs 21.8%, p≤0.001), baseline visual impairment (15.6% vs 5.5%, p≤0.001), diabetes (12.0% vs 7.42%, p≤0.05) and higher baseline depression scores (9.7 vs 8.4 on a scale of 0–30, p≤0.05). In linear regression models, older age, worse distance vision, hypertension or diabetes, illiteracy and lower depression score were significantly associated with undergoing surgery. Results were similar in models including only persons aged ≥60 years, except that urban residence was also associated with surgery. When only those aged ≥60 years with poor vision were included, results were again the same, except that higher household expenditure was also associated with surgery.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> In China, cataract surgical rates remain low; underserved groups such as rural dwellers are less likely to receive cataract surgery.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objectives</strong> We sought to compare the temporal trends in the incidence of death and rehospitalisation for congestive heart failure (CHF) following anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in a Medicare cohort of beneficiaries treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in 2005 (n=1479) with those treated in 2016 through quarter (Q) 2 of 2017 (n=22 432).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> This retrospective analysis examined outcomes using both descriptive and regression analysis to control for differences in patient clinical characteristics over time.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Primary outcome measures</strong> The primary outcomes are 1 year and 2 year rates of mortality and re-hospitalisation for CHF.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Results</strong> The 1 year mortality rate was numerically higher in the 2016 cohort at 10.3% (95% CI 9.9 to 10.7) versus 8.9% (CI 7.4 to 10.3; p=0.068). The 2 year mortality rate was significantly higher in the 2016 cohort at 14.5% (CI 13.9 to 15.1) versus 11.4% (CI 9.2 to 13.6; p&lt;0.01). The 1 year rehospitalisation for CHF was lower in the 2016 cohort at 10.6% (CI 10.0 to 11.2) versus 16.7% (CI 14.0 to 19.4; p&lt;0.001), but the 2 year rate was not significantly different at 19.3% (CI 17.7 to 20.9) versus 20.7% (CI 16.4 to 24.9; p=0.55). After adjustment for covariates with two models, the 1 year mortality increased by 2.3% (CI 0.8 to 3.7; p&lt;0.01) and 4.1% (CI 2.6 to 5.6; p&lt;0.001) in the 2016 cohort. The 2 year adjusted mortality also increased by 4.2% (CI 2.0 to 6.4; p&lt;0.001) and 6.5% (CI 4.2 to 8.7; p&lt;0.001) in the 2016 cohort. The risk adjusted trends for rehospitalisation for CHF were similar to the unadjusted findings.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> Despite prior improvements in STEMI outcomes in the reperfusion era related to the broad adoption of timely PCI, there is a persistent high mortality and CHF burden in Medicare beneficiaries with anterior STEMI. New strategies that address reperfusion injury and enhance myocardial salvage are needed.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Data extraction and synthesis</strong> Information extracted from the literature review was organised using themes and the findings synthesised using thematic analysis.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> The review identified five types of interacting factors that influence healthcare providers’ use of and compliance with clinical guidelines. The factors identified are organisational factors, factors relating to individual healthcare providers, attributes of the clinical guidelines, patient-related factors and institutional factors. Organisational factors can be further divided into the physical work environment, organisational culture and working conditions. The effective use of clinical guidelines in LMIC settings is greatly impacted by the contextualisation of clinical guidelines, end-user engagement and alignment of the implementation of clinical guidelines with the institutional arrangements in the broader health system.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusion</strong> The development and evaluation of concrete interventions is vital to facilitate the implementation of clinical guidelines and improve healthcare service quality. Further studies are necessary to examine the relative importance of the five identified factors on the effective use of clinical guidelines in different contexts.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Introduction</strong> Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) play an important role in evidence-based medicine. However, an article with low reporting quality may mislead both experts and the general public into an erroneous decision. Data sharing can contribute to the truthfulness and transparency of trials. Acupuncture RCTs have been increasing rapidly these years, but the reporting quality and data-sharing level of acupuncture RCTs are not clear. Thus, this study will provide the current status of the reporting quality and data-sharing level of acupuncture RCTs.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Methods and analysis</strong> A cross-sectional study will be conducted. The seven databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CBM, CNKI, Wanfang Database and VIP will be searched between 1 January 2012 and 15 October 2022 to identify acupuncture RCTs. The basic characteristics of included trials will be summarised. The reporting quality for included RCTs will be assessed by the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials 2010 statement and the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture. The data-sharing level will be assessed by open science practices.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Ethics and dissemination</strong> Ethical approval is not required for this study. This protocol has been registered in Open Science Framework Registries. The findings of this study will be submitted to a peer-reviewed academic journal.</p>\n",

       "<h4>STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY</h4>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\">The study will collect acupuncture randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including a broad range of diseases without the restriction of the publication language.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\">The study will use Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials statement and Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture guideline to assess the reporting quality of included acupuncture RCTs.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\">The study will use open science practices to assess the data-sharing level of included acupuncture RCTs.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-9\">We will conduct a training and three rounds of pretests to confirm the consistency of assessing results between the two researchers.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-10\">Due to the limitation of manpower and time, we only include the representative study design, two groups and parallel RCTs.</p>\n",
       "<h2 class=\"\">Background</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-11\">According to the second global survey in 2012 conducted by WHO,<a id=\"xref-ref-1-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-1\">1</a> acupuncture is being used as the most common therapy of traditional and complementary medicine practice reported by 113 member states among 133 replied countries. As it gained more attention, existing academic research in acupuncture has been steadily increasing<a id=\"xref-ref-2-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-2\">2</a> and the diverse applications of acupuncture are extensive from pain syndrome<a id=\"xref-ref-3-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-3\">3</a> to multiple medical disciplines<a id=\"xref-ref-4-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-4\">4</a> including neuroscience,<a id=\"xref-ref-5-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-5\">5</a> obstetrics and gynaecology,<a id=\"xref-ref-6-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-6\">6</a> as well as rehabilitation.<a id=\"xref-ref-7-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-7\">7</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-12\">Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), at the top of the pyramid of the highest strength of clinical evidence,<a id=\"xref-ref-8-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-8\">8</a> are often considered the gold standard for evaluating the efficacy of interventions. However, only adequate reporting of RCTs can provide reliable information and credible conclusions that may aid in policy and medical decision-making. Acupuncture therapies are typically complex during the implementation of RCTs. For an acupuncture RCT, there are many key points needed to be strengthened reporting, which are different from other RCTs, for example, the participants’ compliance, the setting of blinding, the standardisation of acupoint location and the method of needle insertion.<a id=\"xref-ref-9-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-9\">9</a> Despite the increasing number of acupuncture RCTs published in international high-impact journals,<a id=\"xref-ref-10-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-10\">10–13</a> the reporting quality and data-sharing level of these RCTs are not clear.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-13\">To improve transparency and accuracy of the interpretation and replication of RCTs, the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) was first published in 1996,<a id=\"xref-ref-14-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-14\">14</a> updated in 2001<a id=\"xref-ref-15-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-15\">15 16</a> and the latest version was published in 2010,<a id=\"xref-ref-17-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-17\">17 18</a> comprising a checklist, a flow diagram, and an Explanation and Elaboration document. The Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) was drafted in 2001<a id=\"xref-ref-19-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-19\">19</a>and revised in 2010,<a id=\"xref-ref-20-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-20\">20</a> designed as an extension of the CONSORT for acupuncture to increase the reporting for accurate and standardised acupuncture interventions in detail. These two reporting guidelines have the goal of improving research transparency and completeness of reporting, which can help editors and readers fully understand the study process and results.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-14\">In 2004,<a id=\"xref-ref-21-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-21\">21</a> the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) proposed to adopt a trial registration policy requiring investigators to register in a public repository before patient enrolment. Then ICMJE published a proposal<a id=\"xref-ref-22-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-22\">22</a> that clinical trials must contain a data-sharing statement both in the registration and manuscript submission. These proposals establish a favourable environment for clinical trial data disclosure, which can promote evidence dissemination and reusage and avoid research waste.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-15\">The aim of this study is to assess the reporting quality and the data-sharing level of acupuncture RCTs published between 2012 and 2022 by using the CONSORT 2010 checklist and STRICTA, and open science practices, respectively.</p>\n",
       "<h2 class=\"\">Methods</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-16\">This protocol is registered and publicly available via Open Science Framework<a id=\"xref-ref-23-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-23\">23</a> (registration DOI: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/2WTE6\">https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/2WTE6</a>). This cross-sectional study will be written according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology.<a id=\"xref-ref-24-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-24\">24</a> The study is expected to be conducted between 22 November 2022 and 31 December 2024.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Eligibility criteria</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-17\">All published RCTs with two parallel study groups applied to humans that only used acupuncture therapy in the intervention group will be included. The types of the control group include (1) no intervention or waiting list, (2) sham acupuncture or placebo, (3) western medicine, and (4) other interventions such as psychotherapy or rehabilitation and physical therapy guided by modern medical theory. It will also be included if there is a combination with any usual care or conventional therapy in both groups.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-18\">We define the term ‘acupuncture therapy’ as the interventions stimulating specific body areas (called acupoints) by needling, which is based on the traditional Chinese medicine theories, regardless of the difference in instrument size, stimulating spots and needling manipulation, such as body acupuncture, electroacupuncture, auricular acupuncture and acupotomy.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-19\">The following studies will be excluded: (1) if the intervention is acupoint stimulation, and the stimulation does not pierce the skin (such as auricular pressure, acupoint application); (2) the sample size of the study is less than or equal to 10 in each group; (3) authors of the trial are fewer than three; (4) unavailable or no full-text studies (such as conference abstracts, protocols, preprint articles); (5) duplicative articles.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Databases and search strategy</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-20\">A systematic search will be conducted on three English databases (MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica Database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) and four Chinese databases (Chinese Biomedical Literature Service System, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data and VIP Chinese Medical Journal Database) on 15 October 2022. There is no restriction to the language of publication. The time range will be limited from 1 January 2012 to 15 October 2022. The detailed search strategy is shown in <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-1\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental material 1</a>.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"\">Supplemental material</h3>\n",
       "<h3>Literature screening</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-22\">EndNote (V.X7.1) and Rayyan (<a href=\"https://www.rayyan.ai/\">https://www.rayyan.ai/</a>) will be used to screen the Chinese and non-Chinese literature records, respectively.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-23\">The titles and abstracts of included RCTs will be screened by two researchers (XL and PZ) independently based on eligibility criteria. Then, the full texts will be screened by two researchers (XL and PZ) independently based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Discrepancies will be resolved through discussion or by asking two senior investigators (YD and LY).</p>\n",
       "<h3>Basic characteristics extraction</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-24\">An information extraction table with a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel V.2019 MSO 2210 Build 16.0.15726.20188 32) will be made for data extraction.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-25\">The basic information includes the: (1) title, (2) authors, (3) language, (4) publication (year and the journal), (5) country and region where the research was carried out, (6) study design (superiority, non-inferiority or equivalence), (7) sample size, (8) participants (including age, gender), (9) disease system and detailed disease, (10) types of intervention and controls (dose, frequency and duration), (11) study and follow-up period, (12) outcome measures, (13) adverse event (number, type, severity), (14) the main research purpose, (15) funding (industry, independent or none) (16) conflict of interest and (17) registration information.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-26\">The data will be extracted by two researchers (ZX and PZ) independently, and two senior investigators (YD and LY) may make a decision if there exist any differences.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Assessment and data analysis</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-27\">The overall reporting scores will be analysed using descriptive statistics (mean and 95% CI). The categorical data will be presented as a number (n) and per cent (%).</p>\n",
       "<h4>Pretest</h4>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-28\">Before the formal evaluation, evaluators will be trained and three rounds of pretests will be performed to improve the consistency and accuracy between the investigators. Only when the kappa coefficients &gt;0.75 will we enter the formal evaluation.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-29\">Two researchers will complete the formal evaluation independently (ZX and XL). When disagreement happens, the judgement will be discussed or arbitrated by two senior investigators (YD and LY).</p>\n",
       "<h4>CONSORT statement and STRICTA checklist reporting scores</h4>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-30\">The CONSORT 2010 statement and STRICTA checklist will be used for assessing the reporting quality of included acupuncture RCTs. The specific rules for 37 items of CONSORT scoring will be made according to CONSORT Explanation and Elaboration document. The 17 items of the STRICTA checklist will be scored based on the revised STRICTA. Each item is scored in terms of two possibilities: ‘1’ for ‘reported’ or ‘not applicable’, ‘0’ for ‘insufficiently reported’ or ‘unreported’. Each item score of two checklists for each trial will be summed to provide a total score severally, and the percentage of items reported will be also calculated. The detailed evaluation criteria are shown in <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-2-1\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC2\">online supplemental material 2</a>.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"\">Supplemental material</h3>\n",
       "<h4>Open science practices</h4>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-32\">The data-sharing level will be assessed by open science practices, including the following items:</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-33\">Whether there is registration information, including registration number, with accessible protocol. Whether there is a completion date in the registration.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-34\">Whether there is a data-sharing statement, and whether the statement fulfils the ICMJE requirements.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-35\">Will individual participant data be available (including data dictionaries)?</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-36\">What data will be shared?</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-37\">What other documents will be available?</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-38\">When will data be available (start and end dates)?</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-39\">Whether there is a contact person for the data.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-40\">For what types of analyses?</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-41\">By what mechanism will data and code/algorithm/software be made available?</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-42\">Whether there is a direct link to the data (such as a data citation).</p>\n",
       "<h2 class=\"\">Discussion</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-43\">Several systematic reviews of the use of CONSORT and STRICTA checklists<a id=\"xref-ref-25-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-25\">25–28</a> have demonstrated an increase in all the items over time since the introduction and influence of the conception of reporting quality. Svenkerud and MacPherson<a id=\"xref-ref-29-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-29\">29</a> revealed that the mean STRICTA score increased from 4.27 in the 1994–1995 period to 5.53 in 2014–2015 with an 18% improvement, while the mean CONSORT score rose from 1.01 to 3.32 with an increment of 46%.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-44\">Previous researchers have evaluated the reporting quality in RCTs concerning various diseases such as cancer<a id=\"xref-ref-30-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30</a> and its complications,<a id=\"xref-ref-31-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-31\">31</a> stroke and post-stroke rehabilitation,<a id=\"xref-ref-32-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32 33</a> pain,<a id=\"xref-ref-34-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-34\">34 35</a> primary insomnia,<a id=\"xref-ref-36-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-36\">36</a> diabetes,<a id=\"xref-ref-37-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-37\">37</a> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,<a id=\"xref-ref-38-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-38\">38</a> herpes zoster<a id=\"xref-ref-39-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-39\">39</a> and vascular dementia<a id=\"xref-ref-40-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-40\">40</a> among different languages.<a id=\"xref-ref-41-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-41\">41</a> A systematic review by Ma <em>et al</em><a id=\"xref-ref-27-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-27\">27</a> investigated published RCTs between 2004 and 2012 in China and found that the reporting of the sample estimate (1.2%), ethical committee approval (less than 1%) and conflicts of interest (0%) was inadequate. An assessment of 88 papers<a id=\"xref-ref-30-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30</a> on acupuncture for patients with cancer resulted in a conclusion that the reporting of STRICTA items in present studies was generally good but there were weaknesses related to details of other interventions administered to the acupuncture group and details of the acupuncturists administering treatments. Similarly, another systematic review<a id=\"xref-ref-41-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-41\">41</a> of Korean literature drew a conclusion that the completeness of reporting of Korean RCTs of acupuncture was suboptimal, especially the items of sample size calculation (2.9%), allocation concealment (5.8%), ancillary analyses (0.0%) and generalisability of findings (1.9%) in CONSORT as well as the items of setting/context (24.6%) and practitioner background (27.9%) in the STRICTA. Recently, Xiu <em>et al</em><a id=\"xref-ref-28-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28</a> compared the reporting quality of Chinese and English RCTs and emphasised the urgency of the improvement of Chinese articles.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-45\">Open science can be used to assess the credibility and rigour of the articles by preregistration and transparency for replication of studies.<a id=\"xref-ref-42-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-42\">42</a> Preregistration is thought to reduce publication bias toward significant findings. Replication supports researchers to ensure the programmes do not deviate significantly from the desired plan. Besides, it can enhance knowledge innovation based on previous data and code from others, even to correct mistakes. However, there is limited evidence in this field, which is concentrated in a very small number of diseases such as eating disorders,<a id=\"xref-ref-43-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-43\">43</a> traumatic stress<a id=\"xref-ref-44-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-44\">44</a> and gambling,<a id=\"xref-ref-45-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-45\">45</a> with the findings suggesting a large potential for growth in open science practice usage. To our knowledge, there is no formal study that has explored the data-sharing level of the published acupuncture RCTs to date.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-46\">Hence, our study is the first comprehensive study to evaluate the reporting quality and data sharing on articles comprising acupuncture RCTs across all types of diseases according to the CONSORT 2010 and STRICTA, and the open science practices.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-47\">The principles in the Declaration of Helsinki<a id=\"xref-ref-46-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-46\">46</a> require researchers involving human experimentation to perform ethical responsibility to make their findings publicly available with complete and accurate description. However, the problem of poor research reporting is not unusual and can be subdivided into several types including missing or incomplete information, misleading or selective presentation, obscure language or inconsistent argument with a logical fallacy.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-48\">Among 50% of the research, the reporting was insufficient or incomplete, which is a barrier to the generalisation of strong evidence from research results to support clinical practice.<a id=\"xref-ref-47-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-47\">47</a> Since acupuncture is a practitioner-dependent, experience-required intervention,<a id=\"xref-ref-48-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-48\">48</a> the use of acupuncture in different regions<a id=\"xref-ref-49-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-49\">49</a> can vary from regional characteristics, cultural differences, economic restrictions, value orientations or religions; sufficient details of technical manipulation and study contexts should be delivered to enable readers to understand and replicate the operational processes in other research or practices. Adequate and accurate reporting of acupuncture RCTs can not only guarantee the reliability of both the published study and systematic reviews, or clinical practice guidelines based on them but also improve transparency and reduce the risk of interpretation bias, which is essential to medical decision-making and scientific advancement.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Introduction</strong> Upper limb surgery is a common burden on the active and ageing population, often resulting in a transient state of functional impairment. Many activities of daily living can be affected, including ability to drive. Currently there are no guidelines regarding safe return to driving following upper limb surgery. This scoping review aims to systematically review the current literature on the topic of driving following surgery to the upper limb.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Methods and analysis</strong> Informed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses—Scoping Review extension guidelines, this protocol details the scoping review’s methodological and analytical approaches. The review will consider all primary and secondary source articles that examine return to driving following surgery to the upper limb, including the impact of orthoses on functional ability to drive. All studies will be included regardless of methodology and text and opinion pieces will also be considered. Studies conducted in any geographical location or setting will be included in the review. Systematic searches of scientific databases such as OVID (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane), NCBI (PubMed), Scopus, PsycINFO, EBSCOhost (CINAHL), Web of Science, Google Scholar and ProQuest will be conducted. In addition, relevant organisational websites, dissertations, theses from university repositories and grey literature will be included. Further articles will be identified by searching references of relevant studies. Studies conducted in English in any year will be included. Two independent reviewers will screen identified literature sources based on predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Discrepancies will be resolved through discussion, therefore, negating the need for a third reviewer. Article data will be presented in tabular or graphical format along with a narrative summary.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Introduction</strong> Spinal cord infarction (SCInf) is a rare ischaemic event that manifests with acute neurological deficits. It is typically classified as either spontaneous, defined as SCInf without any inciting event, or periprocedural, which typically occur in conjunction with vascular surgery with aortic manipulations. While periprocedural SCInf has recently been the subject of intensified research, especially focusing on the primary prevention of this complication, spontaneous SCInf remains less studied.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Methods and analysis</strong> Electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science and Embase, will be searched using the keywords “spinal cord”, “infarction”, “ischemia” and “spontaneous”. The search will be set to provide only English studies published from database inception. Editorials, letters and reviews will also be excluded. Reference lists of relevant records will also be searched. Identified studies will be screened for inclusion, by one reviewer in the first step and then three in the next step to decrease the risk of bias. The synthesis will address several topics of interest including epidemiology, presentation, diagnostics, treatment strategies, outcomes and predictors. The review aims to gather the body of evidence to summarise the current knowledge on SCInf. This will lead to a better understanding of the condition, its risk factors, diagnosis and management. Moreover, the review will also provide an understanding of the prognosis of patients with SCInf with respect to neurological function, quality of life and mortality. Finally, this overview of the literature will allow the identification of knowledge gaps to help guide future research efforts.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Methods and analysis</strong> The review will involve the following steps: (1) Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander engagement and research governance; (2) defining the scope of the review; (3) search strategy; (4) screening, study selection and appraisal; (5) data extraction and organisation of evidence; (6) data synthesis and drawing conclusions. This realist review will follow the Realist and MEta-narrative Evidence Syntheses: Evolving Standards guidance and will be reported as set up by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols statement. The realist programme theory will be developed through a literature review using multiple database searches from 1 November 1999 to 31 June 2022, limited to the English language, and stakeholder consultation, which will be refined throughout the review process.

       "<h3>Strengths and limitations of this study</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\">The realist review addresses a policy initiative for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia to promote the prevention and early detection of chronic diseases.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\">The methodological approach of combining learnings from published research and key stakeholders’ experiences will provide a holistic view of the studied phenomenon.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\">Involvement of key stakeholders including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples across project objectives, methodology, programme theory design, data extraction, interpretation and dissemination of study findings with valuing Indigenous viewpoints is a novel approach.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-9\">Certainty of the evidence generated may be limited by richness and relevance of available published literature.</p>\n",
       "<h2 class=\"\">Background</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-10\">Chronic diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia.<a id=\"xref-ref-1-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-1\">1</a> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples experience a significant disparity linked to sociocultural determinants, including employment, education, income and experiences of intergenerational and racial trauma, along with lower access to health services, all of which are known to contribute to the early development and progression of chronic disease.<a id=\"xref-ref-2-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-2\">2–4</a> Since 2006, although there have been improvements in disparities for cardiovascular disease, diabetes and kidney disease, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have a disproportionate burden of cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, respiratory disease, cancer, renal disease and mental illness with the onset of these conditions at a younger age than non-Indigenous Australians.<a id=\"xref-ref-1-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-1\">1</a> One tool to address this high burden of disease are health checks delivered in primary healthcare (PHC).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-11\">Preventive healthcare can be provided in any episode of care in primary care, however, health checks offer a structured way of providing a systematic and comprehensive assessment of the patient’s physical, psychological and social well-being. In particular, health checks offer opportunities for screening for chronic disease, risk reduction and management.<a id=\"xref-ref-5-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-5\">5</a> While health checks can be delivered in various formats, in Australia these are funded by Medicare, Australia’s universal health insurance scheme, through specific items in the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), including specific health check items for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.<a id=\"xref-ref-6-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-6\">6</a> Annual claims for MBS-funded Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health checks have increased more than sixfold in the past decade,<a id=\"xref-ref-7-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-7\">7</a> with national policies targeting increased uptake.<a id=\"xref-ref-8-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-8\">8</a> Between 2019 and 2020, 28% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people received an Indigenous-specific health check, and 62% had received at least one Indigenous-specific health check in the 5-year period to June 2020.<a id=\"xref-ref-9-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-9\">9</a> Despite progress in the uptake of health checks, Schütze <em>et al</em> reported barriers to access including low identification rates of Indigenous status and a lack of knowledge of MBS item numbers among practice staff.<a id=\"xref-ref-10-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-10\">10</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-12\">The evidence for the effectiveness of health checks in improving health outcomes is mixed. International systematic reviews have shown that health checks can be associated with increased new diagnoses of risk factors and chronic conditions<a id=\"xref-ref-11-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-11\">11 12</a> and, when delivered in PHC settings, with improvements in immediate health outcomes such as blood pressure control and body mass index.<a id=\"xref-ref-13-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-13\">13</a> Australian studies have generally supported these findings with evidence of health checks supporting evidence-based screening, identifying new diagnoses of chronic conditions, and supporting healthy behavioural change among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.<a id=\"xref-ref-10-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-10\">10 14–16</a> However, some studies identified a low level of motivation and confidence among staff, lack of clarity about specific roles of practice staff, inadequate cultural safety training (training that is only focused on individual clinicians behaviour but does not consider the history of colonisation and its manifestation through institutional or structural racism) and lack of organisational teamwork within the practice as barriers to implementing health checks.<a id=\"xref-ref-17-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-17\">17–20</a> Some studies have shown poor follow-up of problems identified, with changes in evidence-based screening not sustained beyond the first 1–2 years after the introduction of systematic health checks.<a id=\"xref-ref-21-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-21\">21 22</a> Similarly, objective 5.1 of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health plan 2021–2031 acknowledges the need to increase the uptake and quality of health checks.<a id=\"xref-ref-23-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-23\">23</a> Therefore, it is imperative that we develop a deeper understanding of what makes a health check effective at the PHC level. Given the complexity of PHC delivery mechanisms, which at times can be fragmented, uncoordinated and inaccessible,<a id=\"xref-ref-24-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-24\">24</a> it is crucial to understand how and under what circumstances health checks can be effectively implemented.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-13\">A realist review is well suited to exploring these PHC delivery mechanisms by clarifying the settings and contexts that support quality care. A realist review is a systematic review of a complex intervention, and asks the question ‘What works for whom, in what circumstances and in what respects?’.<a id=\"xref-ref-25-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-25\">25</a> The current study will use the realist review framework specifically designed for healthcare systems, as described by Pawson and colleagues, to unpack the context and explore the underlying complexities that impact the implementation and effectiveness of health checks.<a id=\"xref-ref-26-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-26\">26</a> Single simple solution are improbable in intricate healthcare systems and contexts; realist review approaches acknowledge this complexity. Rather it seeks to learn from lived experience and allow room for growth.<a id=\"xref-ref-26-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-26\">26</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-14\">There has been no synthesis of research about the implementation and effectiveness of health checks in the primary and secondary prevention of chronic diseases for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Therefore, this research will address the following specific aims:</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-15\">To identify key contextual factors and causal mechanisms that lead to the success or failure (outcome) of implementing effective health checks in primary care to prevent and detect chronic disease among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-16\">To contribute to the development of an evidence-based framework to build theoretical understanding and evaluate health checks within primary care.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Operational definitions</h3>\n",
       "<h4>Health checks</h4>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-17\">For the purposes of this review a <strong>health check</strong> is defined as the systematic and comprehensive assessment of the patient’s physical, psychological and social well-being with an aim to identify undiagnosed conditions and risk factors in the PHC setting. This aligns with definitional guidance from the Medicare Benefits Schedule for MBS item 715<a id=\"xref-ref-27-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-27\">27</a> and the preamble of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Check templates developed by National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO) and Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP).<a id=\"xref-ref-28-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28</a> These checks may include use of standardised assessment tools, such Australian Diabetes Risk Assessment Tool or the Australian Cardiovascular Risk Assessment Calculator. Isolated screening programmes (ie, blood pressure measurements or echocardiography screening for rheumatic heart disease are excluded, as are health assessments which are not connected to the primary care setting (such as isolated school-based programmes or occupational assessments).</p>\n",
       "<h4>Chronic disease</h4>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-18\">Australia reports data on 10 major chronic condition groups (a<a href=\"https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/chronic-musculoskeletal-conditions/arthritis\">rthritis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/mental-health-services/mental-health-services-in-australia/report-contents/summary-of-mental-health-services-in-australia/overview-of-mental-health-services-in-australia\">mental health conditions</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/chronic-respiratory-conditions/asthma\">asthma</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports-data/health-conditions-disability-deaths/cancer\">cancer</a>, cardiovascular disease, <a href=\"https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/chronic-respiratory-conditions/copd\">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports-data/health-conditions-disability-deaths/diabetes\">diabetes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/chronic-kidney-disease/chronic-kidney-disease\">chronic kidney disease</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/chronic-musculoskeletal-conditions/back-problems\">back pain</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/chronic-musculoskeletal-conditions/osteoporosis\">osteoporosis</a>).<a id=\"xref-ref-29-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-29\">29</a> Additionally, chronic diseases that disproportionately affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, such as liver disease, chronic otitis media, and rheumatic heart disease, will also be considered.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methodology</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-19\">This realist review will follow the Realist and MEta-narrative Evidence Syntheses: Evolving Standards (RAMESES II) guidance and will be reported in accordance with the reporting guidelines set up by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols statement.<a id=\"xref-ref-30-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30</a> Pawson and colleagues developed the realist review approach to synthesise evidence using an explanatory approach.<a id=\"xref-ref-26-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-26\">26</a> Realist review is underpinned by realism philosophy, a theory-driven methodological paradigm that sits between positivism (the world is real and can be observed directly) and constructivism (we can never be sure about reality).<a id=\"xref-ref-31-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-31\">31</a> Realism is viewed as a tent of diverse ideas rather than fixed ideas that can be generated through systematic and careful exploration of underlying causal mechanisms that result in outcomes in any particular context.<a id=\"xref-ref-32-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32</a> In a realist review, the context–mechanism–outcome (CMO) configuration helps to understand how, why and for whom the intervention produced unintended and desired outcomes.<a id=\"xref-ref-33-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-33\">33</a> The following phases are involved while undertaking realist synthesis: (1) Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander engagement and research governance; (2) defining the scope of the review; (3) search strategy; (4) screening, study selection and appraisal; (5) data extraction and organisation of evidence; and (6) data synthesis and drawing conclusions. Any amendments made to the protocol during the study will be reported in the final manuscript developed from this study.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Phase 1: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander engagement and research governance</h4>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-20\">In this phase 1, the ideas developed by our team will be shared and iterated if required with the team from the <em>Thiitu Tharrmay Aboriginal Reference Group</em> and other peak bodies like <a href=\"https://www.racgp.org.au/\">the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners</a> (RACGP) Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Faculty and NACCHO that consist of researchers and community members who advocate and work in the field of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. Importantly, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander researchers from the National Centre for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Well-being Research at ANU and other Australian academic institutions will be invited to join the team. The active engagement and contribution of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander researchers and community representatives will guide us throughout the realist review process and will enable us to synthesise evidence with valuing Indigenous viewpoints.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Phase 2: defining the scope of the review</h4>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-21\">In this phase, a broad literature review will be undertaken to identify approaches to health checks addressing chronic diseases among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia. In addition to this, various quantitative, qualitative and review papers will be identified through literature searches, which will provide clear insights to understand the contextual delivery mechanisms of the intervention. Grey literature such as policy reports, programme reports, student theses and policy briefs will also be searched for potentially relevant material. Building on the broad knowledge generated through literature reviews, such as intervention delivery mechanism, barriers and enablers for the uptake of health checks, intervention outcomes, and so on, an initial programme theory (mapping the sequence of steps) will be developed, that will allow us to understand the delivery mechanism of health checks at PHC level for prevention and early detection of chronic disease. CMOs will be identified using realist logic of analysis in an attempt to identify salient contextual relationships which impact the implementation of health checks for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. In this phase, we will share iterations of programme theory during development by our research team with the <em>Thiitu Tharrmay Aboriginal Reference Group</em> and other peaks RACGP Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Faculty and National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation. This will enable us to refine a programme theory with valuing Indigenous viewpoints which ensure the locus of power lies in the hands of knowledge owner. An initial indicative programme theory has been provided in <a id=\"xref-fig-1-1\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F1\">figure 1</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-22\" class=\"first-child\">Programme theory with Context–Mechanism–Outcome hypotheses.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Phase 3: search strategy</h4>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-23\">In this phase, programme theory will be used to guide the development of the search strategy and key search terms that will be reviewed by review team members and librarian search strategy experts. Multiple electronic databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, Trove, and the Analysis and Policy Observatory database, Australia’s National Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Research and CINAHL will be considered as sources of data for the period 1 November 1999–31 June 2022, limited to the English language. The rationale behind choosing the initial search date is that annual health checks for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders were first specifically funded under the MBS in Australia in November 1999.<a id=\"xref-ref-34-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-34\">34</a> The search will be performed using a combination of subject headings and keywords related to ‘Health Assessment’, ‘Chronic Disease’ and ‘Aboriginal and Torres Islander peoples’, using ‘OR’ and ‘AND’. We will manually perform hand searching of the reference lists of included studies; and will contact authors who have contributed significantly to Aboriginal health around PHC and health assessment focusing on Aboriginal and Torres Islander people’s health. A draft search strategy for PubMed/MEDLINE has been provided in <a id=\"xref-boxed-text-2-1\" class=\"xref-boxed-text\" href=\"#boxed-text-2\">box 1</a>.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-29\">#6.1 AND 2 AND 3 AND (4 AND 5)</p>\n",
       "<h4>Phase 4: screening, study selection and appraisal</h4>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-30\">This review will include research that provides information relating to CMOs (describing the intervention). We will include studies of any designs (randomised controlled trials, quasiexperiments, action research, mixed methods and qualitative studies using recognised methods) and publication types (peer-reviewed journal articles, programme reports, grey literature from Department of Health websites and Clinical Commissioning Groups) that involved adults (aged 18 years and over) who identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander. Publications like letters to the editor, conference abstracts, publications other than the English language and studies that do not provide sufficient information on why an intervention worked (for whom and in what context) will be excluded from this study. Further eliminations will be made if the objective of the study is not focused on health checks, or if a study only reported on chronic conditions such as autoimmune disorders and cystic fibrosis that are not in line with the chronic disease operational definition presented in this study. <a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-1\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">Table 1</a> presents additional inclusion and exclusion criteria, and these will likely be refined during the review process. Search results will be exported to the reference management tool, EndNote20, and then search results will be uploaded to Covidence, where the title, abstract and full-text screening of the search results will be done by two members of the research team. For validation, 10% of the included and excluded articles will be assessed independently by another two research team members.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-31\" class=\"first-child\">Inclusion and exclusion criteria</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-46\">The quality appraisal for all the included studies will be conducted using quality assessment tools relevant to the individual study design. For example, we will use ‘Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools’ that align with study designs such as randomised controlled trials, observational and analytical studies, ‘mixed methods appraisal tool’ for mixed-methods studies<a id=\"xref-ref-35-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-35\">35</a> and Implementation Science Research Development (ImpRes) tool for implementation research.<a id=\"xref-ref-36-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-36\">36</a></p>\n",
       "<h4>Phase 5: data extraction and organisation of evidence</h4>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-47\">Following iterative process and discussions within the review team—including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health researchers—a data extraction sheet valuing Indigenous viewpoints will be developed. Later, data extraction sheet will be finalised after rigorous discussion with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander researchers and collaborators from NACCHO and RACGP Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Faculty. The data extraction sheet will capture the information that is relevant to study objectives and programme theory developed in the scoping review phase. During data extraction, any relevant missing information will be marked as ‘not reported’. Predesigned data extraction will be piloted on four selected articles of different study designs to check the functionality and comprehensiveness of the designed data extraction sheet. The data extraction sheet will include study characteristics (title, author, publication year, study setting, participants characteristics, study objective, study design), study findings (such as intervention components, delivery mechanism, enablers and barriers, delivery CMO aspects) and quality appraisal. In this context, enablers are any external or internal factors that promote/facilitate or enable the uptake of health checks across PHC contexts recognised by consumers or other stakeholders with provided theoretical explanations. Likewise, barriers are any internal or external factors that impeded the delivery or uptake of health checks across PHC contexts identified by consumers or other stakeholders under consideration. Importantly, advice for context will be sought from <em>Thiitu Tharrmay Aboriginal Reference Group</em> at ANU. In this phase, we will also map the underpinning theory of intervention that the authors described to produce one or more desired outcomes.</p>\n",
       "<h4>Phase 6: data synthesis and drawing conclusions</h4>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-48\">This phase will use a realist logic of analysis to make sense of the data extracted from phase 4 and will likely result in refining of the programme theory that was developed in phase 1. We will use both deductive and inductive analysis processes for the interpretation of the data. Data on CMOs will be sought within and across the documents to explain how the contexts influenced the intervention mechanism and outcomes. Interpretive cross-case comparison will be used to explain how and why the intended outcomes have occurred or why the intervention failed to produce a particular outcome. The extracted data will be coded and will be presented narratively. We will also conduct 6–7 regular meetings with working groups (n=4–6) and one final round table discussion with larger group of stakeholders (n=10–15) to obtain a wide range of perspectives. The insights from these evidence reviews, and perspectives of these experts gained through the larger round of discussion will be synthesised to develop the final programme logic. Finally, these research findings and recommendations will provide an evidence-base for the design and implementation of people-centred strategies for the provision of health checks, and the experience of these health checks. In turn, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples will benefit from improved and effective prevention and early detection of chronic disease. Strength-based approaches<a id=\"xref-ref-37-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-37\">37</a> that privilege Indigenous ways of knowing (epistemology), ways of being (ontology) and ways of doing (axiology) will be applied while interpreting data and making recommendations rather than helicopter approach where non-Indigenous researchers inadequately acknowledge situated Indigenous viewpoints in process of knowledge generation.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Patient and public involvement</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-49\">Patient and public involvement is central to the development of this review project. This project has involved key knowledge users such as researchers from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities/services and peak bodies working for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in the development of the research and initial programme theory. These key knowledge users will be involved throughout the project via meetings and knowledge sharing workshops, which will ensure that recommendations derived from this project will reflect their knowledges, priorities and aspirations.</p>\n",
       "<h2 class=\"\">Discussion</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-50\">This study will be the first realist review to provide an understanding of how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health checks are being provided and identify the opportunities for improving the prevention and early detection of chronic disease in the PHC setting. This study will help to build a realist programme theory that will help to identify opportunities and strategies for service improvement in relation to the health check at the PHC level. Additionally, evidence informed recommendations that intentionally value voice, context and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture will guide policymakers, researchers and wider stakeholders codesign people-centred interventions for improving the delivery of health checks for prevention and early detection of chronic disease in PHC.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-51\">An anticipated challenge with our study could be the development and interpretation of programme theory, which is common in realist reviews. In order to address this potential issue, we have developed a team of subject and context experts from various institutions who work in this area. The team of experts will help to develop, refine and interpret the programme theory to answer the review question. Another issue that can be an obstacle to the realistic review process is the significant resources and time required to complete phases 2–4: screening; data extraction and interpretation of findings. We have a team of two–three members with dedicated time working in a supportive environment (access to resources and training) which should enable completion in a realistic timeframe. Similar to other reviews, organisation and interpretation of data is time consuming part of realist review and to overcome this the team of experts will be consulted throughout the review process to guide in this regard. Another challenge with realist review is the rigour of selected studies which will be acknowledged as limitations in the final analysis. More importantly, the review team of this study included Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander researchers who will be involved through all phases of the review, to allow Indigenous perspectives and knowledge to be integrated in the knowledge creation process; ensuring research is valid and meaningful.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-52\">This research is grounded in active involvement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander researchers in coproduction of knowledge with including Indigenous viewpoints on what works and what is needed. The perspectives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander authors will be privileged throughout this work (including project objectives, methodology design, data extraction, interpretation and dissemination of study findings) and informed by input from <em>NACCHO–RACGP</em> Partnership project team who develop the <em>National guide to preventive healthcare for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people</em><a id=\"xref-ref-38-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-38\">38</a> and work to support and promote health checks that are culturally safe, effective and valued by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Alongside knowledge and contextual contributions, early career Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander researchers involved in this project will learn with the wider team about process of conducting realist reviews and analysis. This shared learning will support capacity development for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander collaborators and co-authors.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-53\">Plain language summaries of study findings will be shared through Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organizations which is controlled by local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community members (through a locally elected board), so it is the good avenue to relay findings to local communities and families. Study findings will also be disseminated through academic publications, policy briefs, conference presentations and knowledge exchange seminars with policymakers within Australian Government Department of Health, RACGP, NACCHO, the Aboriginal community-controlled health sector, Lowitja Institute and other relevant stakeholders.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objectives</strong> To systematically synthesise the results of primary qualitative studies on how community-dwelling older adults experience shared decision-making processes, express preferences and actively participate in care.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> Systematic review of qualitative studies and qualitative meta-synthesis.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Methods</strong> We focused on studies about community-dwelling participants aged ≥65 undergoing a health-disease process circumscribed to a primary healthcare setting, and the central theme should focus on either shared decision-making, expressing preferences or patient participation. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus and PsycINFO (time publication frame 2012–2022). We excluded studies in those cases where the qualitative results were not analysed or unrelated to the phenomenon addressed, phenomena were not clear enough to be included or the setting did not occur in the community.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Results</strong> A total of 12 studies were included in this meta-synthesis. We appraised the quality of the selected studies through Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) Checklist. The metasummary comprised the frequency and intensity of qualitative patterns across the included studies. The meta-synthesis revealed four influential elements in their interaction: recognising personal qualities, facing professional characteristics, experiences of discrimination and a double-edged context.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> The phenomena studied were influenced by how older people approached their role in their binomial relationship with healthcare professionals. Those with a reinforced self-concept were better aware of health-disease-related situations regarding shared decision-making and the importance of being communicatively assertive. Professional characteristics were also crucial in how older people modulated their acting ability through their personality, communication skills and the approach healthcare professionals used towards older adults. Situations of discrimination generated through an imbalance of power inhibited the expression of preferences and hindered the active participation of older people. The context surrounding the participants influenced all these situations, key in tipping the balance between a therapeutic and a harmful side.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Introduction</strong> Hemiparetic gait is one of the most common sequelae of a stroke. Acupuncture has shown potential in correcting hemiplegic gait patterns and improving motor function recovery after stroke. However, controversial findings and a lack of supportive evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture for post-stroke hemiplegia. The intelligent gait analysis system provides a new perspective for the study of hemiparetic gait. This systematic review aims to collect relevant studies and critically evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in alleviating gait disturbance of post-stroke hemiplegia based on quantified gait parameters.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Methods and analysis</strong> A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane stroke group trials register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, AMED, three Chinese databases (Chinese Biomedical Literatures database (CBM), National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wan fang Digital Periodicals), four trails registries (The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, The Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, and The Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry) will be conducted to identify randomised controlled trials of acupuncture for gait disturbance in post-stroke patients. No restrictions on language or publication status. The primary outcomes are gait temporospatial parameters (eg, step length, stride length, step width, step frequency (cadence), walking speed, etc), and gait kinematic parameters (eg, hip peak flex/extend angle, knee peak flex/extend angle, ankle peak dorsi/plantar-flexion angle, etc). We will assess bias using the approach recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. A meta-analysis will be conducted to synthesise the evidence for each outcome measure. The χ<sup>2</sup> test and I<sup>2</sup> statistic will be used for assessing heterogeneity between studies.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Introduction</strong> Medical adhesives are adhesives used in medical devices to establish and maintain contact with the body over a period of time (usually by application to the skin) and are widely used in most care settings. Application of medical adhesives to the skin can lead to skin stripping, mild or severe allergic reactions and skin irritation that may manifest as redness, itching or rash. Adhesive-related skin injury can lead to infection, delayed wound healing and an increased risk of scarring. These injuries can cause severe discomfort and pain, and can affect the patient’s quality of life. A systematic review summarising patient’s experiences on this topic will contribute to informing adhesive producers and policy makers, and guiding further development and improvement of available technologies.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objective</strong> This study was designed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with occupational respiratory morbidity among hairdressers in Northwestern Ethiopia.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> A cross-sectional study was conducted from 6 July 2022 to 17 August 2022. The data were collected using a standardised American Thoracic Society questionnaire. The collected data were entered into EpiData V.4.6 and analysed using Stata V.14. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with occupational respiratory morbidity. The association was determined using an adjusted OR (AOR) with a 95% CI at a p value of &lt;0.05.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Setting</strong> The study was conducted in Gondar city, Northwestern Ethiopia.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Participants</strong> A total of 403 hairdressers participated in this study.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Outcome measures</strong> The primary outcome is the prevalence of occupational respiratory morbidity.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> The total response rate was 95.5%. The majority, 250 (62%) of the respondents were women. The mean age (±SD) of the respondents was 27 (±6.0) years. The overall prevalence of occupational respiratory morbidity during the past 12 months was found to be 134 (33.3%) (95% CI (28.7% to 38.1%)). Female hairdressers (18.6%) showed greater respiratory morbidity than male hairdressers (14.7%). Working experience 3–5 years (AOR: 3.05; 95% CI (1.76 to 5.30)) and working experience &gt;5 years (AOR: 6.22; 95% CI (2.73 to 14.16)), overweight (body mass index (BMI)) (AOR: 3.01; 95% CI (1.19 to 7.58)) and working near roadsides (AOR: 2.15; 95% CI (1.33 to 3.37)) were risk factors of occupational respiratory morbidity among hairdressers.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> This study concluded that one-third of hairdressers experienced occupational respiratory morbidity. Longer work experience, higher BMI and working near roadsides were identified as significant risk factors for respiratory morbidity in hairdressers. Dietary calorie restrictions for overweight individuals and the development and implementation of air pollution mitigation measures targeted at roadside workers are advised to curb the problem.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objectives</strong> Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming the leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. However, treatment of NAFLD is potentially influenced by psychological conditions. Using the simplified version of the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA-SV) scale, this study aimed to evaluate the stage of psychological change as a prerequisite to refining implementation strategies for psychological change.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> A multicentre cross-sectional survey.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Setting</strong> Ninety hospitals in China.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Participants</strong> 5181 patients with NAFLD were included in this study.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Outcome measures</strong> All patients completed the URICA-SV questionnaire and were assigned to one of the three stages of change (precontemplation, contemplation or action) according to their readiness scores. A stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent factors associated with the stage of psychological change.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> A total of 4832 (93.3%) patients were included in the precontemplation stage and only 349 (6.7%) considered making a change or preparing to make one. There were significant differences in gender (Cohen’s d=0.039, p=0.005), age (Cohen’s d=−0.327, p&lt;0.001), waist circumference (Cohen’s d=0.143, p=0.003), alanine transaminase (Cohen’s d=0.347, p=0.001), triglyceride (Cohen’s d=0.351, p=0.002), body mass index (BMI; Cohen’s d=0.056, p&lt;0.001), proportion of hyperlipidaemia (Cohen’s d=0.068, p&lt;0.001) and cardiovascular disease (Cohen’s d=0.032, p=0.029), therapeutic regimen (Cohen’s d=0.136, p&lt;0.001), and Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire-Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease overall score (Cohen’s d=−0.420, p&lt;0.001) between patients with NAFLD in the precontemplation stage and those in the contemplation/action stage. Logistic regression identified BMI (HR 0.659, 95% CI 0.469 to 0.928, p=0.017), cardiovascular disease (HR 2.161, 95% CI 1.089 to 4.287, p=0.027) and triglyceride (HR 0.751, 95% CI 0.591 to 0.955, p=0.020) as independent factors predicting psychological change.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> The results demonstrated that very few patients with NAFLD presented psychological condition in the stage of action. Psychological condition was found to be significantly related to BMI, cardiovascular disease and triglyceride factors. Integrated diversity considerations for evaluating psychological change are necessary.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Participants</strong> Participants with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus irrespective of age, sex and comorbidities.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Interventions</strong> Drug interventions authorised by EMA or FDA.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Primary outcome measures</strong> Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and serious adverse events.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> We included 17 clinical trials randomising 16 257 participants to 8 different interventions authorised by EMA or FDA. 15/17 of the included trials (88.2%) were assessed at high risk of bias. Only molnupiravir and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir seemed to improve both our primary outcomes. Meta-analyses showed that molnupiravir reduced the risk of death (relative risk (RR) 0.11, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.64; p=0.0145, 2 trials; very low certainty of evidence) and serious adverse events (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.84; p=0.0018, 5 trials; very low certainty of evidence). Fisher’s exact test showed that ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir reduced the risk of death (p=0.0002, 1 trial; very low certainty of evidence) and serious adverse events (p<em>&lt;</em>0.0001, 1 trial; very low certainty of evidence) in 1 trial including 2246 patients, while another trial including 1140 patients reported 0 deaths in both groups.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> The certainty of the evidence was very low, but, from the results of this study, molnupiravir showed the most consistent benefit and ranked highest among the approved interventions for prevention of COVID-19 progression to severe disease in outpatients. The lack of certain evidence should be considered when treating patients with COVID-19 for prevention of disease progression.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objective</strong> To summarise the available evidence on the risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, compared with the risk among unvaccinated individuals in the absence of COVID-19 infection.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> Systematic review and meta-analysis.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Data sources</strong> Electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Web of Science and WHO Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease), preprint repositories (medRxiv and bioRxiv), reference lists and grey literature were searched from 1 December 2020 until 31 October 2022.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Study selection</strong> Epidemiological studies of individuals of any age who received at least one dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, reported a risk of myo/pericarditis and compared the risk of myo/pericarditis to individuals who did not receive any dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Data extraction and synthesis</strong> Two reviewers independently conducted screening and data extraction. The rate of myo/pericarditis among vaccinated and unvaccinated groups was recorded, and the rate ratios were calculated. Additionally, the total number of individuals, case ascertainment criteria, percentage of males and history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were extracted for each study. Meta-analysis was done using a random-effects model.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> Seven studies met the inclusion criteria, of which six were included in the quantitative synthesis. Our meta-analysis indicates that within 30-day follow-up period, vaccinated individuals were twice as likely to develop myo/pericarditis in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to unvaccinated individuals, with a rate ratio of 2.05 (95% CI 1.49–2.82).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusion</strong> Although the absolute number of observed myo/pericarditis cases remains quite low, a higher risk was detected in those who received mRNA COVID-19 vaccinations compared with unvaccinated individuals in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in preventing severe illnesses, hospitalisations and deaths, future research should focus on accurately determining the rates of myo/pericarditis linked to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, understanding the biological mechanisms behind these rare cardiac events and identifying those most at risk.</p>\n",

The screening rates were low in the surveyed countries, ranging from 3.5% (95% CI 3.1% to 4.0%) in Rwanda to 17.1% (95% CI 15.8% to 18.5%) and 17.4% (95% CI 16.1% to 18.8%) in Zambia and Zimbabwe. Inequalities in screening rates were low based on covariates. Combining the inequalities led to significant inequalities in screening probabilities between women living in rural areas aged 25–34 years, with a primary education level, from the lowest wealth quintile, and women living in urban areas aged 35–49 years, with the highest education level, from the highest wealth quintile, ranging from 4.4% in Rwanda to 44.6% in Zimbabwe.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> Cervical precancer screening rates were inequitable and low. No country surveyed achieved one-third of the WHO’s target of screening 70% of eligible women by 2030. Combining inequalities led to high inequalities, preventing women who were younger, lived in rural areas, were uneducated, and from the lowest wealth quintile from screening. Governments should include and monitor equity in their cervical precancer screening programmes.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Introduction</strong> The key tools for mitigating the impact of COVID-19 and reducing its transmission include testing, quarantine and isolation, as well as telemonitoring. Primary healthcare (PHC) can be essential in increasing access to these tools. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to implement and expand an intervention consisting of COVID-19 testing, isolation, quarantine and telemonitoring (TQT) strategies and other prevention measures at PHC services in highly socioeconomically vulnerable neighbourhoods of Brazil.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Methods and analysis</strong> This study will implement and expand COVID-19 testing in PHC services in two large Brazilian capital cities: Salvador and Rio de Janeiro. Qualitative formative research was conducted to understand the testing context in the communities and at PCH services. The TQT strategy was structured in three subcomponents: (1) training and technical support for tailoring the work processes of health professional teams, (2) recruitment and demand creation strategies and (3) TQT. To evaluate this intervention, we will conduct an epidemiological study with two stages: (1) a cross-sectional sociobehavioural survey among individuals from these two communities covered by PHC services, presenting symptoms associated with COVID-19 or being a close contact of a patient with COVID-19, and (2) a cohort of those who tested positive, collecting clinical data.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Ethics and dissemination</strong> The WHO Ethics Research Committee (ERC) (#CERC.0128A and #CERC.0128B) and each city’s local ERC approved the study protocol (Salvador, ISC/UFBA: #53844121.4.1001.5030; and Rio de Janeiro, INI/Fiocruz: #53844121.4.3001.5240, ENSP/Fiocruz: #53844121.4.3001.5240 and SMS/RJ #53844121.4.3002.5279). Findings will be published in scientific journals and presented at meetings. In addition, informative flyers and online campaigns will be developed to communicate study findings to participants, members of communities and key stakeholders.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objective</strong> To assess implementation status of public health emergency operations centres (PHEOCs) in all countries in Africa.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> Cross-sectional.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Setting</strong> Fifty-four national PHEOC focal points in Africa responded to an online survey between May and November 2021. Included variables aimed to assess capacities for each of the four PHEOC core components. To assess the PHEOCs’ functionality, criteria were defined from among the collected variables by expert consensus based on PHEOC operations’ prioritisation. We report results of the descriptive analysis, including frequencies of proportions.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Results</strong> A total of 51 (93%) African countries responded to the survey. Among these, 41 (80%) have established a PHEOC. Twelve (29%) of these met 80% or more of the minimum requirements and were classified as fully functional. Twelve (29%) and 17 (41%) PHEOCs that met 60%–79% and below 60% the minimum requirements were classified as functional and partially functional, respectively.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> Countries in Africa made considerable progress in setting up and improving functioning of PHEOCs. One-third of the responding countries with a PHEOC have one fulfilling at least 80% of the minimum requirements to operate the critical emergency functions. There are still several African countries that either do not have a PHEOC or whose PHEOCs only partially meet these minimal requirements. This calls for significant collaboration across all stakeholders to establish functional PHEOCs in Africa.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Setting</strong> A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted in public and tertiary hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 15 January 2022 to 30 July 2022.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Participants</strong> A total of 326 adult hypertensive patients who visited the chronic diseases clinic for follow-up were included in the study.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Primary and secondary outcome measures</strong> A high predicted 10-year CVD risk level was assessed using an interviewer-administered questionnaire and physical measurement (primary data) and reviews of medical data records (secondary data) by using a non-laboratory WHO risk prediction chart. Logistic regression with an adjusted OR (AOR) using a 95% CI was calculated for independent variables associated with 10-year CVD risk.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Results</strong> The prevalence of a high predicted 10-year CVD risk level was 28.2% (95% CI 10.34% to 33.2%) among the study participants. A higher CVD risk level was found to be associated with age (AOR 4.2 for age 64–74, 95% CI 1.67 to 10.66), being male (AOR 2.1, 95% CI 1.18, 3.67), unemployment (AOR 3.2, 95% CI 1.06 to 6.25) and stage 2 systolic blood pressure (AOR 11.32; 95% CI 3.43 to 37.46).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Conclusion</strong> The study showed that the respondent’s age, gender, occupation and high systolic blood pressure were determinant factors for CVD risks. Therefore, routine screening for the presence of CVD risk factors and assessment of CVD risk are recommended for hypertensive patients for CVD risk reduction.</p>\n",

The primary outcomes will be symptoms of aggressive behaviour, quality of life for the individual or their careers, and discontinuation or dropouts/withdrawals of antipsychotics due to adverse events. The secondary outcomes are other not serious adverse events and adherence to pharmacotherapy. Selection, data extraction, and quality assessment will be performed by pairs of reviewers, independently. The Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) and Risk of Bias in Non-Randomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tools will be used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies.

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Introduction</strong> Evidence indicates that, compared with their non-disabled counterparts, disabled people are likely to face greater mental health challenges as well as significant inequalities in accessing appropriate therapeutic support. Currently, little is known about how disabled people perceive and experience counselling and psychotherapy, what barriers/facilitators to therapy delivery and/or therapy participation exist for disabled clients and whether clinicians sufficiently adapt their practice to meet the needs of this diverse but marginalised population. In this paper, we outline a proposal for undertaking a scoping review that aims to identify and synthesise current research relating to disabled individuals’ perceptions of accessibility and experiences of counselling and psychotherapy. The review aims to identify current gaps in the evidence base and inform how future research, practice and policy may develop and foster inclusive strategies and approaches which will support the psychological well-being of disabled clients accessing counselling and psychotherapy.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Methods and analysis</strong> The undertaking and reporting of the proposed scoping review will be guided by the framework outlined by Arksey and O’Malley and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Systematic searches of the PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, EBSCO and Cochrane Library electronic databases will be conducted. Reference lists of relevant studies will be reviewed to identify additional studies. Eligible studies will be limited to those published from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2022 and in the English language. Empirical studies involving disabled individuals receiving and/or who have received a form of therapeutic intervention will be included. Data will be extracted, collated and charted, and will be summarised quantitatively through descriptive numerical analysis and qualitatively through a narrative synthesis.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Ethics and dissemination</strong> The proposed scoping review of published research will not require ethical approval. Results will be disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-5\">To our knowledge, there is no systematic scoping review that has explored disabled individuals’ perceptions and experiences of counselling and psychotherapy, including issues of accessibility.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\">The proposed review will ensure transparency and rigour by following Arksey and O’Malley’s methodological framework for scoping reviews and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines for synthesising evidence and assessing the scope of literature on a subject.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\">The proposed review will be coproduced with a disabled researcher and academic, as well as involve consultation with four disabled people, all of whom have lived or personal experience of participating in and delivering counselling, psychotherapy or mental health services and/or of living with/caring for someone else using similar services. These collaborators were involved in shaping the design of this current protocol and their perspectives will be central to ensuring that the findings and potential recommendations emerging from the full scoping review resonate and reflect the lived experience of disabled people.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objective</strong> To determine the prevalence and associated factors of self-care behaviours among people with hypertension in the Kathmandu district of Nepal.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> Cross-sectional study.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Setting</strong> Municipalities of Kathmandu district, Nepal.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Participants</strong> We enrolled 375 adults aged ≥18 years with a minimum 1-year duration of hypertension using multistage sampling.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Outcome measures</strong> We used the Hypertension Self-care Activity Level Effects to assess self-care behaviours and collected data through face-to-face interviews. We conducted univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses to determine the factors associated with self-care behaviours. The results were summarised as crude and adjusted ORs (AORs) with 95% CIs.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> The adherence to antihypertensive medication, Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, physical activity, weight management, alcohol moderation, and non-smoking were 61.3%, 9.3%, 59.2%, 14.1%, 90.9%, and 72.8%, respectively. Secondary or higher education (AOR: 4.42, 95% CI: 1.11 to 17.62), Brahmin and Chhetri ethnic groups (AOR: 3.30, 95% CI: 1.26 to 8.59) and good to very good perceived health (AOR: 3.96, 95% CI: 1.60 to 9.79) were positively associated with DASH diet adherence. Males (AOR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.19 to 3.55) had higher odds of physical activity. Brahmin and Chhetri ethnic groups (AOR: 3.44, 95% CI: 1.63 to 7.26) and secondary or higher education (AOR: 4.70, 95% CI: 1.62 to 13.63) were correlates of weight management. Secondary or higher education (AOR: 2.47, 95% CI: 1.16 to 5.29), body mass index ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (AOR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.04 to 3.22) and income above the poverty line (AOR: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.08 to 4.63) were positively associated with non-smoking. Furthermore, Brahmin and Chhetri ethnic groups (AOR: 4.51, 95% CI: 1.64 to 12.40), males (AOR: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.50) and primary education (AOR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.85) were associated with alcohol moderation.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusion</strong> The adherence to the DASH diet and weight management was particularly low. Healthcare providers and policymakers should focus on improving self-care by designing simple and affordable interventions for all patients with hypertension.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Purpose</strong> The purpose of the Radiotherapy Dataset (RTDS) is to collect consistent and comparable data across all providers of National Health Service (NHS)-funded radiotherapy and to provide intelligence for service planning, commissioning, clinical practice and research.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Participants</strong> The RTDS is a mandated dataset requiring providers to collect and submit data monthly for patients treated in England. Data is available from 01 April 2009 to 2 months behind the calendar month.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\">The National Disease Registration Service (NDRS) started receiving data from 01 April 2016. Prior to this, the National Clinical Analysis and Specialised Applications Team (NATCANSAT) were responsible for the RTDS. NDRS holds a copy of the NATCANSAT data for English NHS providers.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\">The RTDS contains clinical information on the primary disease being treated, modality and intent of treatment, dose fractionation and hospital appointment details. Due to constraints in RTDS coding, linkage to the English National Cancer Registration dataset is beneficial.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Findings to date</strong> The RTDS has been linked to the English National Cancer Registration and Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy (SACT) datasets and to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) to provide a more complete picture of the patient cancer pathway. Findings include a study to compare outcomes for patients treated with radical radiotherapy, an investigation of factors influencing 30-day mortality, assessing sociodemographic variation in the use of treatment and a study to assess the service impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A range of other studies have been completed or are ongoing currently.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Future plans</strong> The RTDS can be used for a variety of functions including cancer epidemiological studies to investigate inequalities in treatment access; provide service planning intelligence; monitor clinical practice; and support clinical trial design and recruitment. Collection is to continue indefinitely, with regular updates to the data specification to enable capture of more detailed information on radiotherapy planning and delivery.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Introduction</strong> In the new revised National Institute for Health &amp; Care Excellence (NICE, TA566, 2019) guidelines for cochlear implantation (CI) have clearly stipulated that the hearing loss must be bilateral. Prior to this revision, children and young people (CYP) with asymmetrical thresholds have been considered for unilateral CI when one ear was in audiological criteria. Children with asymmetrical hearing loss represent an important cohort of potential CI candidates, who will continue to be prevented from benefiting from CI unless evidence is produced to support implantation and maximise subsequent benefit.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\">The aim of this study is to evaluate the ‘real-life’ hearing performance in a group of children who have received a unilateral CI and who have hearing thresholds in the contralateral ear that are outside the current UK NICE 2019 audiological criteria for CI. The contralateral ear will be aided using a conventional hearing aid (HA). The outcomes from this ‘bimodal’ group will be compared with a group of children who have received bilateral CI, and a group of children using bilateral HA, to extend the current knowledge about the different performance levels between bilateral CI, bilateral HA and bimodal hearing in CYP.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Methods and analysis</strong> Thirty CYP aged 6–17 years old, 10 bimodal users, 10 bilateral HA users and 10 bilateral cochlear implant users will be subjected to a test battery consisting of: (1) spatial release from masking, (2) complex pitch direction discrimination, (3) melodic identification, (4) perception of prosodic features in speech and (5) TEN test. Subjects will be tested in their optimal device modality. Standard demographic and hearing health information will be collected. In the absence of comparable published data to power the study, sample size was determined on pragmatic grounds. Tests are exploratory and for hypothesis generating purposes. Therefore, the standard criterion of p&lt;0.05 will be used.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Ethics and dissemination</strong> This has been approved by the Health Research Authority and NHS REC within the UK (22/EM/0104). Industry funding was secured via a competitive researcher-led grant application process. Trial results will be subject to publication according to the definition of the outcome presented in this protocol.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Introduction</strong> Intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) is a common cause of stroke worldwide. However, whether the treatment options for symptomatic ICAS is stent placement or medical therapy alone is still controversial. At present, three multicentre randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been published, but their research designs are also slightly different and the conclusions are not completely consistent. Therefore, we plan to conduct a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials to ascertain safety and efficacy of stenting versus medical therapy alone for symptomatic patients with intracranial arterial stenosis.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Methods and analyses</strong> We will identify RCTs comparing stenting vs medical therapy alone in patients with symptomatic ICAS stenosis (70%–99%) through a systematic search, mainly including PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov. Individual-level patient data for a prespecified list of variables will be sought from authors of all eligible studies. The primary outcome was a composite of stroke or death within 30 days, or stroke in territory of qualifying artery beyond 30 days after randomisation. IPD meta-analysis will be conducted with a one-stage approach.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Ethics and dissemination</strong> Ethical approval and individual patient consent will not be required in most cases since this IPD meta-analysis will use pseudoanonymised data from RCTs. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and international conferences.</p>\n",

This study analysed those regional differences in Japan to help policymakers provide more uniform and efficient rehabilitation services and optimally allocate related resources.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> An ecological study.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Setting</strong> 47 prefectures and 9 regions in Japan in 2017.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Primary and secondary outcome measures</strong> Primary measures were ‘supply/utilisation (S/U) ratio’, calculated by dividing rehabilitation supply converted to service units, by rehabilitation utilisation and ‘utilisation/expected utilisation (U/EU) ratio’, calculated by dividing utilisation by EU. The EU was defined as utilisation expected from the demography in each area. Data required to calculate these indicators were collected from open sources such as the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan Open Data Japan.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Results</strong> The S/U ratios were higher in Shikoku, Kyusyu, Tohoku and Hokuriku regions, and lower in Kanto and Tokai regions. The number of rehabilitation providers per population was higher mostly in the western part of Japan and lower mostly in the eastern part. The U/EU ratios were also higher mostly in the western part, and lower mostly in the eastern part such as Tohoku and Hokuriku regions. The same trend was seen for cerebrovascular disease and musculoskeletal disorder rehabilitation, which accounted for approximately 84% of rehabilitation services. For disuse syndrome rehabilitation, such a trend did not exist, and the U/EU ratio differed by prefectures.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> The large surplus in rehabilitation supply in the western part was attributed to the greater number of providers, while the smaller surplus in Kanto and Tokai regions was due to the smaller amount of supply. The number of rehabilitation services used was lesser in the eastern part such as Tohoku and Hokuriku regions, indicating regional differences in the provision of rehabilitation services.</p>\\n<h2 class=\"\">Data availability statement</h2>\\n<p id=\"p-78\">Data are available upon reasonable request.

Therefore, those balances should be considered for individual countries or regions.<a id=\"xref-ref-5-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-5\">5</a></p>\\n<p id=\"p-15\">In Japan, the subcommittee on the supply/demand of PTs and occupational therapists (OTs) in the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) reported in 2019 that the supply surpassed the demand and would be 1.5 times the demand in 2040, indicating the possibility of oversupply.<a id=\"xref-ref-6-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-6\">6</a> Morii <em>et al</em> predicted the supply/demand of PTs in Japan and indicated that there could be oversupply in the future.<a id=\"xref-ref-7-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-7\">7</a> However, Morii <em>et al</em> also stated that the relative disparity in PT supply, such as regional disparity and that among rehabilitation services, should also be considered.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-16\">Medical services are provided at universal prices in Japan, according to the national fee table.<a id=\"xref-ref-8-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-8\">8</a> Health insurance claims are made for each patient at each institution providing medical services, every month. In recent years, those claims are administered by the government in a database called the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan (NDB), which researchers can use with approval.<a id=\"xref-ref-9-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-9\">9</a> NDB Open Data Japan is open sourced where the results of basic aggregation using NDB are published.<a id=\"xref-ref-10-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-10\">10</a> The results of basic aggregation, such as rehabilitation utilisation by prefectures and age groups, are available. Therefore, an analysis of regional differences in the provision of rehabilitation services can be conducted using NDB Open Data Japan. There are few reports that analysed regional differences in the supply/demand or supply/utilisation balance of rehabilitation services using national databases regardless of countries.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-17\">Therefore, we analysed the regional differences regarding the provision and the supply/utilisation balances of rehabilitation services, to help provide more uniform and efficient rehabilitation services, and optimal allocation of the related resources.</p>\\n<h2 class=\"\">Methods</h2>\\n<h3>Subjects and outcomes</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-18\">Forty-seven prefectures and the nine regions in Japan, in 2017, where rehabilitation services were provided, were included in the study. The geographical locations and brief description on the characteristics of the prefecture and regions are shown in <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-1\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental appendix 1</a>. By region, Kanto has the highest population (44\\u2009million, including Tokyo prefecture and Yokohama in Kanagawa prefecture), followed by Kinki (22.5\\u2009million, including Osaka) and Tokai (15\\u2009million, including Nagoya in Aichi prefecture). The supply included PTs, OTs and speech therapists (STs), who were the main rehabilitation providers in Japan.</p>\\n<h3 class=\"\">Supplemental material</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-20\">The primary outcomes were ‘supply/utilisation ratio’ (S/U ratio) calculated by dividing rehabilitation supply converted to service units, by rehabilitation services used (utilisation; see the equation), and ‘utilisation/expected utilisation ratio’ (U/EU ratio), calculated by dividing utilisation by EU. The EU was defined as utilisation expected from the demography in each area multiplied by the average amount of utilisation in overall Japan. These indicators’ details are explained in the following sections.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-21\"><span class=\"disp-formula\" id=\"disp-formula-1\"><span class=\"highwire-responsive-lazyload\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" class=\"highwire-embed lazyload\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" data-src=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/sites/default/files/highwire/bmjopen/13/6/e071670/embed/mml-math-1.gif\"><noscript><img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/sites/default/files/highwire/bmjopen/13/6/e071670/embed/mml-math-1.gif\"></noscript></span><span class=\"disp-formula-label\">(1)</span></span></p>\\n<h3>Supply of rehabilitation</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-22\">Data regarding the number of rehabilitation providers in 2017 were collected from the Survey of Medical Institution by MHLW,<a id=\"xref-ref-11-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-11\">11</a> defined as the amount of ‘supply’ in this study. The supply was converted to the number of rehabilitation service units under the assumption that one rehabilitation provider worked 251 days per year<a id=\"xref-ref-12-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12</a> and provided 15 or 18 units of rehabilitation per day (one unit is 20\\u2009min, and one rehabilitation provider providing 18 units is a standard in the national fee table).<a id=\"xref-ref-8-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-8\">8</a></p>\\n<p id=\"p-23\">Moreover, the number of rehabilitation providers per population and the average number of rehabilitation units per provider per day were calculated.</p>\\n<h3>Utilisation of rehabilitation</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-24\">‘Utilisation’ and ‘expected amount of utilisation’ (EU) were defined and calculated. The former was defined as the number of rehabilitation service units used in 2017. The data on the utilisation were collected from the NDB Open Data Japan.<a id=\"xref-ref-10-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-10\">10</a></p>\\n<p id=\"p-25\">Utilisation of rehabilitation services included the inpatient and outpatient services listed in <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-2-1\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC2\">online supplemental appendix 2</a>. These services were insured for rehabilitation regardless of professionals such as PTs, OTs and STs. For ‘I007 Psychiatry occupational therapy’, 2\\u2009hours—six times the length of other rehabilitation services—was considered the standard time, and 25 patients were considered as the standard number treated at a time. Therefore, that service was counted as the 6th of 25 rehabilitation units per utilisation. ‘H008 Group communication therapy’ was counted as one-third rehabilitation unit per utilisation.</p>\\n<h3 class=\"\">Supplemental material</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-27\">The EU indicated the amount of rehabilitation service utilisation expected from the demography in each region or prefecture in 2017. It was calculated for each region and prefecture by multiplying the population by age groups in each area<a id=\"xref-ref-13-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-13\">13</a> with the average amount of utilisation per person in Japan, which was calculated by dividing the total utilisation in Japan by age groups<a id=\"xref-ref-10-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-10\">10</a> by the population in the corresponding age groups in Japan<a id=\"xref-ref-13-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-13\">13</a> (equation 2).</p>\\n<p id=\"p-28\"><span class=\"disp-formula\" id=\"disp-formula-2\"><span class=\"highwire-responsive-lazyload\"><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" class=\"highwire-embed lazyload\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" data-src=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/sites/default/files/highwire/bmjopen/13/6/e071670/embed/mml-math-2.gif\"><noscript><img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/sites/default/files/highwire/bmjopen/13/6/e071670/embed/mml-math-2.gif\"></noscript></span><span class=\"disp-formula-label\">(2)</span></span></p>\\n<p id=\"p-29\">where: i=sex, j=age group, utilisation=utilisation of rehabilitation services in a region or prefecture, population=population in a region or prefecture, utilisation in Japan=utilisation of rehabilitation services in overall Japan, population in Japan=population in overall Japan.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-30\">The S/U ratio and the U/EU ratio of the overall rehabilitation services were calculated for each region and prefecture. The S/U ratio was calculated by dividing the supply by the utilisation. The U/EU ratio was calculated by dividing utilisation by EU. U/EU ratio was also calculated for disease-specific rehabilitation service. Disease-specific rehabilitation included the five major services numbered H000–H003 in <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-2-2\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC2\">online supplemental appendix 2</a>.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-31\">Moreover, to clarify the amount and the time trend of the utilisation, the amount and the increased rates of actual utilisation from the previous year were calculated using data of NDB Open Data Japan.<a id=\"xref-ref-10-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-10\">10</a> Before 2015, rehabilitation for disuse syndrome was part of cerebrovascular disease rehabilitation (ie, rehabilitation for disuse syndrome was insured for patients with cerebrovascular disease who had disuse syndrome before 2015). Therefore, for the data from 2014 to 2015, cerebrovascular disease rehabilitation was provided for patients with disuse syndrome, and was counted as disuse syndrome rehabilitation service.</p>\\n<h3>Patient and public involvement</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-32\">No patients were involved.</p>\\n<h2 class=\"\">Results</h2>\\n<h3>S/U ratio</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-33\">The results of the S/U ratio are shown in <a id=\"xref-fig-1-1\" class=\"xref-fig\" href=\"#F1\">figure 1A,B</a> and <a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-1\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">tables 1 and 2</a>.

While the increase rate from the previous year was 1%–3% for cerebrovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease and respiratory disorder rehabilitation, the rate was more than 5% for disuse syndrome, cardiac disorder and cancer rehabilitation.</p>\\n<h3 class=\"\">Supplemental material</h3>\\n<h2 class=\"\">Discussion</h2>\\n<p id=\"p-55\">This study analysed the regional differences in the supply/utilisation balance and provision of rehabilitation services by prefectures and regions using NDB Open Data Japan.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-56\">In Tokai and Kanto regions, the S/U ratio was the lowest, close to 1. The smaller number of rehabilitation providers per population contributed to little supply surplus. Morii <em>et al</em><a id=\"xref-ref-14-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-14\">14</a> compared the regional supply disparity between healthcare occupations in Hokkaido prefecture and reported that there is a possibility of maldistribution of PTs and OTs by smaller number of providers in rural areas within the prefecture. On the contrary, in this study at between-prefectural level, the results indicated that there was less surplus of supply in populated prefectures such as Tokyo and Kanagawa (Kanto region) and Aichi (Tokai region). Since it is desirable to have a certain amount of surplus in supply considering uncertainty in service utilisation, the amount of supply should be increased in these regions, ideally from regions where there is large amount of supply surplus.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-57\">Possible ways to increase the supply are adjusting the number of schools or enrolments, decreasing the attrition rates in less-supplied regions (supply-related parameters have been shown in the PT career path model by Morii <em>et al</em><a id=\"xref-ref-7-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-7\">7</a>), and an implementation of region-specified enrolments at medical schools in which enrollees are required to work in a prespecified region or prefecture for several years after graduation. Such a system has been implemented for physicians for some schools in Japan.<a id=\"xref-ref-15-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-15\">15</a></p>\\n<p id=\"p-58\">The U/EU ratio was higher mostly in the western part of Japan, such as Kyusyu and Shikoku regions, and lower mostly in the eastern part, such as Tohoku and Hokuriku regions. The result was consistent with the analysis of regional differences in medical expenditure by the MHLW, which indicates that adjusted per-population medical expenditure was greater mostly in the western part of Japan, especially for inpatient medical services.<a id=\"xref-ref-16-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-16\">16</a> As is shown in <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-2\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental appendix 1</a> and <a id=\"xref-table-wrap-1-5\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T1\">table 1</a>, medical resource density, both in general and for rehabilitation, was higher in the western part. Relationships between medical resource density and medical service utilisation have been shown in Japan for outpatient services for chronic disease<a id=\"xref-ref-17-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-17\">17</a> and inpatient services and outpatient services in general<a id=\"xref-ref-18-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-18\">18</a> and elsewhere.<a id=\"xref-ref-19-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-19\">19 20</a> Izumida <em>et al</em><a id=\"xref-ref-18-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-18\">18</a> reported that this relationship can be caused by supplier-induced demand and by patient factors such as consultation rates, and their results indicated a presence of supplier-induced demand. Although the results were not for rehabilitation services, but for inpatient services and outpatient services in general, the trend can be applicable to rehabilitation services since rehabilitation services are provided along with other services, and not in isolation. However, it is still unclear whether the result was attributed to the regional differences in the consultation rates or the number of rehabilitation services provided per patient, or whether the regional differences are explained by supplier-induced demand. It is necessary to clarify whether there is supplier-induced demand on rehabilitation service utilisation, and further analyse it to avoid unnecessary and inefficient treatments.<a id=\"xref-ref-21-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-21\">21</a></p>\\n<p id=\"p-59\">Economic factors could also influence the utilisation of rehabilitation services. In Japan, Babazono <em>et al</em> reported that average monthly salary had a high positive correlation with outpatient service indicators,<a id=\"xref-ref-22-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-22\">22</a> indicating the possibility of low-income patients being discouraged from seeking medical services. Since the U/EU ratio was the lowest in Tohoku region, where average income is also low, it is possible that economic status could have influenced the utilisation of rehabilitation services.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-60\">Although it is difficult to clarify the right amount of rehabilitation required from this study, the result of U/EU ratios indicates that there are regional differences in the provision of rehabilitation services in Japan. Although S/U ratio was higher in Tohoku and Hokuriku regions, which could indicate a seemingly surplus in supply, it may be attributed to the lower amount of utilisation since the amount of supply in these areas was not large (<a id=\"xref-table-wrap-2-2\" class=\"xref-table\" href=\"#T2\">table 2</a>). It is necessary to ensure that sufficient amount of rehabilitation is provided through further research, such as detailed analysis on disease-specific rehabilitation services, in Tohoku and Hokuriku regions since shortages of rehabilitation could lead to worse patient outcomes. It is also necessary to consider whether the amount of rehabilitation provided in the western part of Japan, with larger amount of utilisation and supply, is appropriate from the perspectives of uniform and efficient rehabilitation.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-61\">Regarding disease-specific rehabilitation, whereby the results of U/EU showed mostly the same trend as that of the overall rehabilitation, priority should be given to cerebrovascular disease and musculoskeletal disorder rehabilitation since these services accounted for 84% of the disease-specific rehabilitation services. As <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-2-4\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC2\">online supplemental appendix 2</a> shows, although these services are reimbursed for patients with various types of diseases, data from NDB Open Data Japan do not include what disease each patient using these services has. Therefore, further detailed analysis needs to be conducted for individual diseases, treatments and treatment phases to clarify what exactly contributed to the regional differences, for instance, using NDB database.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-62\">Nakanishi <em>et al</em> conducted a survey in 597 hospitals in Japan and reported that even in hospitals providing advanced medical care, cardiac rehabilitation was not sufficiently common.<a id=\"xref-ref-23-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-23\">23</a> Goto reported that the reasons for not providing cardiac rehabilitation were a shortage of staff, requirements for institutions and proficiency for hospitals.<a id=\"xref-ref-24-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-24\">24</a> The results indicate that the low amount of supply in Tohoku region could lead to the low amount of utilisation of cardiac disorder rehabilitation.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-63\">In the Japanese fee schedule, the convalescent rehabilitation ward fee has been insured for patients for whom cardiac disorder rehabilitation is provided since 2022, meaning providing more intensive rehabilitation for those patients will be expected.<a id=\"xref-ref-8-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-8\">8</a> Jesus <em>et al</em> reported that not considering unmet needs could affect the amount of required rehabilitation services.<a id=\"xref-ref-5-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-5\">5</a> Therefore, it is important to consider unmet needs not only for cardiac rehabilitation but also rehabilitation services overall, and this analysis needs to be refined whenever unmet needs are clarified.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-64\">Unlike the trend for the overall rehabilitation services, the U/EU ratio was not different by region but by prefectures for disuse syndrome rehabilitation. This could be because of the differences between prefectures in the root diseases from which disuse syndrome arose, the prevalence and the number of rehabilitation services per patient, and rehabilitation content (other rehabilitation services such as cerebrovascular disease rehabilitation can be reimbursed for patients with disuse syndrome depending on the disease one has). The causes of the regional differences should be clarified by further analysis, such as one for patients with individual conditions who have disuse syndrome, since disuse syndrome rehabilitation can be used by patients with a wide range of root conditions.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-65\">This is one of the few studies that analysed regional differences in the supply/utilisation balance and the provision of rehabilitation services using data from a national database in Japan, which is one of the most ageing countries in the world.<a id=\"xref-ref-25-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-25\">25</a> Rehabilitation services will also be of greater importance in other rapidly ageing countries, and its demand will continue to increase; our methodology is applicable to other countries to consider the provision of more uniform and efficient rehabilitation services although design and interpretation should be made as per the context.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-66\">However, this study has several limitations. First, subject regional units were prefectures and regions due to a lack of data granularity. Analysis of the finer regional units needs to be conducted as per requirement. Next, since NDB does not include health insurance claims of publicly funded healthcare (eg, healthcare for welfare recipients), the calculated utilisation could have underestimated the actual amount of utilisation by a few per cent. In addition, data from NDB indicate utilisation, not the need for rehabilitation services. Therefore, it is out of scope of this study whether the current rehabilitation supply meets the needs for rehabilitation services or to assess what amount of service utilisation is appropriate. Finally, as shown in <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-2-5\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC2\">online supplemental appendix 2</a>, some rehabilitation services can be provided for patients with a wide range of conditions. Therefore, it is difficult to determine rehabilitation for which specific disease or condition contributed to the results. Further analysis targeting individual conditions should be conducted.</p>\\n<h2 class=\"\">Conclusion</h2>\\n<p id=\"p-67\">This study analysed the regional differences in the supply/utilisation balance and the provision of rehabilitation services using NDB Open Data Japan to help consider provision of more uniform and efficient rehabilitation services.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-68\">The results showed that the S/U ratio was highest in Shikoku, Kyusyu, Tohoku and Hokuriku regions, while it was lowest in Kanto and Tokai regions primarily due to smaller number of rehabilitation providers, which led to little surplus of supply. The U/EU ratio was lowest in Tohoku and Hokuriku regions, indicating smaller amount of utilisation in these regions. Higher S/U ratios in these regions were attributed to the smaller amount of utilisation since the amount of supply was relatively small.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-69\">For further analysis on regional differences, priority should be given to cerebrovascular disease rehabilitation and musculoskeletal disorder rehabilitation, which accounted for 84% of the disease-specific rehabilitation services. The U/EU ratio for these rehabilitation services showed the same trend as overall rehabilitation services, higher mostly in the western part of Japan, while lower mostly in the eastern part.</p>\\n<h2 class=\"\">Data availability statement</h2>\\n<p id=\"p-78\">Data are available upon reasonable request.

       "'<h2 class=\"\">Introduction</h2>\\n<p id=\"p-14\">As COVID-19 spread within countries, vulnerable and marginalised populations such as specific ethnic minorities and migrant or refugee groups have been unduly affected. Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in early 2022 indicated that the COVID-19-related death rate for people born overseas was 6.8 per 100 000, compared with 2.3 for those born in Australia.<a id=\"xref-ref-1-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-1\">1</a> Further, the mortality rate for people born in the Middle East (29.3 deaths per 100 000) was 10 times than that of those born in Australia. International data also support that compared with the white population majority, there has been a much greater risk of infection and adverse outcomes from COVID-19 among black, Asian, and minority ethnic groups, black Americans, Hispanics, Latinos, other people of colour and Indigenous groups.<a id=\"xref-ref-2-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-2\">2</a></p>\\n<p id=\"p-15\">There is a human rights obligation for governments to act on the needs of ethnic minority members during pandemics and other health crisis periods. This includes ensuring available resources and supporting community understanding and capacity to engage with recommendations. However, communication is still characterised by the large-scale exclusion of linguistic minorities from timely, high-quality information.<a id=\"xref-ref-3-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-3\">3</a> These communities can also be left behind in their access to and understanding of recommendations, compounded by cultural discordance and mistrust of health institutions.<a id=\"xref-ref-4-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-4\">4</a> For example, while public health information about COVID-19 mitigation measures and vaccination was available in multiple languages online, recent research has highlighted that COVID-19 information on Australian government websites did not cater to the health literacy levels of some people from racial and ethnic minority communities,<a id=\"xref-ref-5-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-5\">5</a> nor did the communication efforts necessarily reach or engage the community members.<a id=\"xref-ref-6-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-6\">6</a> Furthermore, even when official COVID-19 messages are translated in Australia, they have been criticised for their poor quality and visibility.<a id=\"xref-ref-7-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-7\">7 8</a> These issues are heightened among the elderly, which can be attributed to their inability to search for health information online and a communication gap between older adults and the public health information dissemination system.<a id=\"xref-ref-9-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-9\">9</a></p>\\n<p id=\"p-16\">For the remainder of this paper, the term culturally and linguistically diverse (CaLD) will be used, as it is commonly used in Australia. CaLD communities include people born in non-English speaking countries and where English is not the primary language spoken at home (including second-generation family members).<a id=\"xref-ref-10-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-10\">10</a> CaLD communities are distinct yet heterogenous groups with unique health delivery needs.<a id=\"xref-ref-11-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-11\">11</a> The differences in disease risk between CaLD and non-CaLD communities, which have been apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, were similarly observed in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.<a id=\"xref-ref-12-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-12\">12</a> However, there has been a failure to update Australia’s pandemic plan to reflect the needs of CaLD communities during pandemics. A review of Australia’s COVID-19 pandemic plans at the regional, state and national level revealed that there were significant deficiencies in effectively involving immigrant or CaLD communities and responding to their actual health requirements and difficulties.<a id=\"xref-ref-13-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-13\">13</a> In the development stage of all the plans reviewed, no input, opinions or discussions with CaLD community groups were reported. The assessed plans included no acknowledgement of the diversity of CaLD populations. At the time of publication, even the WHO’s plan did not discuss CaLD community challenges in accessing health information.<a id=\"xref-ref-13-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-13\">13</a> The COVID-19 pandemic has exemplified the critical need for revisions to pandemics plan to include equity considerations and an expansion of vulnerable populations to include the possibility of increased risk of disease among those from racial and ethnic minority groups. It is also critical that the voices and needs of these communities are reflected in the plans. As a starting point, this review aims to consolidate the evidence regarding the key issues experienced by these communities, focused on communication and engagement processes identified through research and evaluation efforts led by the multicultural service providers. Importantly, it captures the recommendations and strategies put forward aimed at enhancing engagement and communication efforts in times of crisis.</p>\\n<h2 class=\"\">Method</h2>\\n<p id=\"p-17\">This scoping review investigated the published and grey literature on communication and engagement of people from CaLD backgrounds in Australia during COVID-19. This included exploring engagement and communication problems and the proposed strategies for improvement. The methodology for this scoping review is based on Arksey and O’Malley’s<a id=\"xref-ref-14-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-14\">14</a> four-stage frameworks, including (a) identifying the research questions, (b) identifying relevant studies, (c) selecting studies and (d) collating, summarising and reporting the results. This method has been used in recent publications focused on these target populations.<a id=\"xref-ref-15-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-15\">15–17</a></p>\\n<h3>Research questions</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-18\">The review aimed to answer three main questions: (1) what communication issues people from CaLD communities commonly experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic have? (2) what strategies were implemented? and (3) recommendations have been proposed to improve communication and engagement for ethnic and racial minority groups during the current COVID-19 pandemic and in future similar events? It was beyond the scope of this current review to examine the effectiveness of implemented strategies on improving community understanding or participation in public health COVID-19 recommendations.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-19\">For this study, we define communication as ‘a mode of the imparting or exchanging of messages by speaking, writing or using some other medium’,<a id=\"xref-ref-18-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-18\">18</a> which during a pandemic involves not only communicating information to individuals but also in a much broader context. We define engagement in a community context as the ‘involvement and participation of individuals, groups and structures within a parameter of a social boundary or catchment area of a community for decision-making, planning, design, governance and delivery of services’.<a id=\"xref-ref-19-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-19\">19</a></p>\\n<h3>Identification of studies</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-20\">The studies were identified using six medical and management databases, including Scopus, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PsychINFO and CINAHL. In addition, the grey literature was searched within the following organisation’s websites identified as being involved with ethnic minority communities as well as a Google search of key terms used in the database search strategy: Australian State and Federal Government Departments of Health, State and National social services, peak bodies and community-controlled organisations and councils (see <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-1\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental file 1</a> for the entire search strategy and summary of studies included in the review).</p>\\n<h3 class=\"\">Supplemental material</h3>\\n<h3>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-22\">To include as many relevant studies as possible, this study included original research, case studies, reports (including government and charity reports), systematic and scoping review articles and literature reviews available in English. However, only studies published from January 2020 to August 2022 were included due to the availability of COVID-19-specific articles. This review encompasses several aspects of health communication, including investigations into exposure to various channels of health communication, information retrieval, language usage, message framing, digital and health literacy and trust in information sources. It is not restricted to a single element of health communication.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-23\">Exclusion criteria included articles published before January 2020, books, preprints, opinion pieces, commentaries, viewpoints, editorials and articles not in English.</p>\\n<h3>Selection of studies</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-24\">Searching the six databases and relevant grey literature websites resulted in 1012 studies. After removing all duplicates, 711 articles remained. After excluding articles by abstract and title, 152 articles remained. The full-text screening for relevance to the topic and research questions resulted in 38 retained for final inclusion in the scoping review. This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines<a id=\"xref-ref-20-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-20\">20</a> (see <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-2-1\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC2\">online supplemental file 2</a>). In addition, the included literature was evaluated for risk of bias and quality. The risk of bias was minimised by having two researchers involved in the review process.</p>\\n<h3 class=\"\">Supplemental material</h3>\\n<h3>Data analysis</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-26\">In accordance with the instructions for conducting scoping reviews,<a id=\"xref-ref-21-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-21\">21</a> PM gathered information from the included papers into a matrix before synthesising it. This matrix consisted of data such as the author’s name, year of publication, study design, purpose or objectives of the study, study population, methodology, sample characteristics, key concepts, outcomes and significant findings related to the objectives. Data synthesis was achieved through qualitative content analysis.<a id=\"xref-ref-22-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-22\">22</a> The results relevant to the review questions were summarised, coded and categorised inductively into the main categories.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-27\">In the first instance, after the final stage of reviewing the full-text articles for eligibility and becoming familiar with the data, initial coding and themes were drawn from the full text. This was undertaken using an inductive approach by the corresponding author (PM), with segments of text from each eligible paper coded separately in common ideas before being discussed and revised with the primary author (HS), with some new codes being generated or existing codes being modified two times before organising the codes into broader themes, including the addition of subthemes, and then writing up the findings after the themes were discussed and agreed on by authors. The main categories described are presented descriptively within each category close to the original findings of the included studies.</p>\\n<h3>Patient and public involvement</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-28\">No patient was involved.</p>\\n<h2 class=\"\">Results</h2>\\n<p id=\"p-29\">The final review included 38 studies combining published academic papers and grey literature (refer to <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-2\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental file 1</a>). Of these, 8 were mixed method studies, 20 were qualitative, 1 was quantitative and the remaining were a combination of reports, briefs and submissions using a mix of research methods. All studies had a focus or strong mention of ethnic and racial minority communities and their experiences, impacts, engagement or communication during COVID-19. All studies and reports were based in Australia. The reviewed studies are organised based around the focus areas: (1) factors impacting the communities’ ability to access and act on public health messaging, (2) strategies implemented during COVID-19 and (3) recommendations for future crisis.</p>\\n<h3>Factors impacting the communities’ ability to access and act on public health messaging</h3>\\n<h4>Lack of trust in authority</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-30\">Multiple studies highlighted the impact trust in authority has on supporting community members to follow the provided advice and guidance during the pandemic.<a id=\"xref-ref-23-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-23\">23–25</a> In addition, specific concerns were raised by authors about the impact that ongoing fear and mistrust in governments has had on vaccine uptake among Arabic-speaking and African communities,<a id=\"xref-ref-26-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-26\">26</a> migrants more generally<a id=\"xref-ref-27-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-27\">27</a> and refugee participants.<a id=\"xref-ref-28-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28</a> The study authors also raised concerns about the impact of distrust in government sources and the link to the spread of misinformation from social media.<a id=\"xref-ref-26-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-26\">26</a> Actions by the Australian government during lockdowns, especially the lack of communication and engagement with ethnic minority communities, were postulated to further increase fear, anxiety and mistrust.<a id=\"xref-ref-23-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-23\">23 25</a> For example, among the community leaders interviewed concerns were expressed that the deployment of police to a residential area in Melbourne (which has a high proportion of ethnically diverse community members) during lockdown diminished the confidence of community members in following advice and guidance due to past experiences of oppression and insecurity.<a id=\"xref-ref-25-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-25\">25</a> In addition, historical experiences of persecution and conflict in the home countries for some migrants were suggested by authors as contributing to instances of mistrust towards the government.<a id=\"xref-ref-28-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28</a></p>\\n<h4>Lack of access and ineffective communication channels</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-31\">Many studies reported information access issues and limitations to COVID-19-specific information.<a id=\"xref-ref-9-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-9\">9 24 26 27 29–31</a> This was attributed to language barriers, low digital or English literacy levels, lack of education, reliance on family and friends, and needing access to adequate digital devices. The communication gap between the public health dissemination system and older ethnic minority adults was highlighted to perpetuate the vulnerability of some populations, including the elderly’s inability to access information during the COVID-19 pandemic.<a id=\"xref-ref-26-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-26\">26 29</a> Several studies reported that there was a sense that governments relied heavily on digital materials and platforms for communication.<a id=\"xref-ref-29-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-29\">29</a> For example, Hamiduzzaman <em>et al</em><a id=\"xref-ref-9-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-9\">9</a>, in a survey of older ethnic minority adults in South Australia, reported common experiences of participants not being able to access online health information and found that community members aged 80 years old and above were in the worst position to access online health education.<a id=\"xref-ref-9-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-9\">9</a> Similar experiences were noted in older Ezidi community members.<a id=\"xref-ref-24-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-24\">24</a></p>\\n<h4>Low literacy levels and understanding</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-32\">The studies repeatedly reported low literacy, English proficiency and heath literacy as impacting ethnic minority community member access and understanding of COVID-19 information, directly increasing the risk of these communities not receiving critical health messaging.<a id=\"xref-ref-6-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-6\">6 24 26 30 32–36</a> There were also reports of information avoidance due to low English proficiency.<a id=\"xref-ref-32-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32</a> There were other influences at play impacting members’ understanding. For example, Seale <em>et al</em> (2022b) reported that issues surrounding ‘technical jargon’ in COVID-19 resources potentially affect their understanding of information in those with low or health literacy levels. Lastly, past trauma and psychological issues were reported by the Ezidi community and service providers, which may have presented an additional challenge impacting refugees’ ability to understand and learn new information related to COVID-19.<a id=\"xref-ref-24-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-24\">24</a></p>\\n<h4>Lack of timely and culturally responsive materials</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-33\">A significant criticism of the Australian government’s pandemic response by ethnic minority community leaders and service providers was the lack of timely translations into the languages spoken by these community members.<a id=\"xref-ref-24-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-24\">24 29 37</a> Participants from the Ezidi, Arabic-speaking, Pasifika and Chinese-speaking communities reported that information was either not translated into their languages or it was difficult to find.<a id=\"xref-ref-26-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-26\">26 32</a> Other key observations focused on the quality of translations and the lack of resources in minimal English for those in the community with low literacy levels.<a id=\"xref-ref-29-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-29\">29 37</a> One author postulated that the lack of culturally responsive and tailored materials increased mistrust and misunderstanding among community members.<a id=\"xref-ref-30-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30</a></p>\\n<h4>Poor quality of information</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-34\">Concerns were raised over the ‘information overload’ (also termed infodemic), where the overabundance of information from government sources lead to further confusion,<a id=\"xref-ref-27-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-27\">27 29</a> and the related anxieties over community leaders filtering down or incorrect interpretation/translation of information.<a id=\"xref-ref-38-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-38\">38</a> For example, Ezidi service providers reported difficulty finding accurate COVID-19-related information because of inconsistent messaging, despite having high literacy and being native English speakers.<a id=\"xref-ref-24-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-24\">24</a> In relation to vaccine hesitancy, studies reported conflicting information, poor communication from trusted sources and an overall lack of information about the vaccine all contributed to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in ethnic minority communities.<a id=\"xref-ref-28-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28 33</a> In addition, misinformation regarding the COVID-19 vaccine, symptom management and prevention was reported as typical in participants due to commonly experiencing information barriers and contributed to vaccine hesitancy and following health guidance.<a id=\"xref-ref-30-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30 35 39</a></p>\\n<h4>Poor engagement and communication</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-35\">A lack of engagement and collaboration with ethnic minority communities, government advisory groups and community member voices within policy and decision-making was cited as a significant challenge to effectively communicating and engaging with communities during the COVID-19 pandemic.<a id=\"xref-ref-13-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-13\">13 25 30 37 40</a> For example, a qualitative review of six pandemic plans in Australia found significant gaps in engaging with ethnic minority communities, specifically a lack of focus on the need for engagement activities in all the plans assessed.<a id=\"xref-ref-13-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-13\">13</a></p>\\n<h3>Strategies implemented during COVID-19 to enhance communication and engagement efforts</h3>\\n<h4>Filling the void: community controlled organisations</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-36\">The findings from a study by Weng <em>et al</em> highlighted the significant role that community and religious organisations played in supporting community members and international students during COVID-19.<a id=\"xref-ref-31-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-31\">31</a> In interviews with CEOs and other stakeholders from community organisations, it became clear that a broad spectrum of measures had been taken to address the digital divide that is evident among certain ethnic minority groups. This included lending or donating laptops and Wi-Fi dongles to their community members, offering online sessions to teach the use of Zoom, FaceTime and other online platforms and offering older community members weekly telephone calls.<a id=\"xref-ref-38-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-38\">38</a></p>\\n<p id=\"p-37\">Further research revealed that this assistance extended beyond the practicalities of food and shelter to include emotional and financial support. This ensured that even those who were ineligible for social welfare had access to vital coping mechanisms during the pandemic.<a id=\"xref-ref-31-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-31\">31</a></p>\\n<h4>Trusted gateways: community/religious leaders and bilingual health workers</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-38\">With trust being cited as fundamental to relationship building and information sharing, community members and multicultural stakeholders within many of the studies have repeatedly referenced the critical role that community leaders, service providers, community organisations, health professionals and young community members play in engagement and communication during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.<a id=\"xref-ref-24-5\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-24\">24–26 30–33 35 38 41–45</a> Community and religious leaders were frequently cited as necessary in supporting communities during the COVID-19 pandemic and being the trusted gateway to engagement and communication of critical information.<a id=\"xref-ref-26-5\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-26\">26 41 42</a> This support included adapting information to ensure public health messages reached communities and those vulnerable to low literacy and digital literacy levels, such as the elderly.<a id=\"xref-ref-26-6\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-26\">26</a> In some settings, community and religious leaders also set up support networks for their members, public information sessions, homework groups and online sessions focused on community-nominated topics.<a id=\"xref-ref-30-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30</a></p>\\n<p id=\"p-39\">One study highlighted the types of support (including emotional) provided by a community leader during the Melbourne lockdown via this quote:</p>\\n<p id=\"p-40\">In early July 2020, in my capacity as a community leader, I assisted communities such as Vietnamese, Somalis, Middle Eastern communities and South Sudanese during the residential lockdown in North Melbourne and Flemington Estates. I coordinated culturally appropriate food delivery, including medicines. In addition, I provided Department of Health, and Human Services (DHHS) translated materials in various languages to assure and educate the residents about COVID-19 testing and safe social distancing practice. As a result, I was able to calm down the resident’s fear, anxiety, and depression related to the COVID-19 lockdown<em>.</em> (25, p.1707).</p>\\n<p id=\"p-41\">In the context of COVID-19 information gaps, local service providers, including health professionals, have been identified as playing a key role in communicating health information to the community.<a id=\"xref-ref-24-6\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-24\">24 26 32 41</a> Health professionals were cited as a trusted source of COVID-19 communication for community members during COVID-19, as they have previously developed relationships based on rapport and interpersonal communication.<a id=\"xref-ref-26-7\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-26\">26</a></p>\\n<h4>Young people</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-42\">Findings highlight the importance of young people during the COVID pandemic, specifically in supporting community needs in communication, mental health, racism, employment, income support and emergency relief.<a id=\"xref-ref-23-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-23\">23 33 35</a> Although currently underused, young ethnic minority young people have already been an essential resource in designing COVID-19 messaging to ensure cultural appropriateness during COVID-19.<a id=\"xref-ref-35-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-35\">35</a> A great example of this is shown in a case study presented in a report by the NSW Council of Social Services, where the Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District codesigned a community engagement and education programme, ‘Be a COVID Warrior’ where bicultural high school students were successfully provided with education aimed at increasing their health literacy. They, in turn, were encouraged to communicate with their families to raise health literacy and confidence in applying infection control measures.<a id=\"xref-ref-33-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-33\">33</a> Further examples were shown in a study by Couch <em>et al</em>, where young refugee people reported creating video clips to share COVID-19-related information in their native languages, shared information through WhatsApp and went door-knocking to pass on COVID-19 information, accompanied by a nurse.<a id=\"xref-ref-43-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-43\">43</a></p>\\n<h3>Recommendations for future crisis</h3>\\n<h4>Collaboration and consultation</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-43\">Collaboration and consultation were the most frequently cited recommendations for ensuring successful engagement and communication between government, government organisations, settlement agencies, charities and communities during COVID-19 and beyond.<a id=\"xref-ref-27-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-27\">27 32 33 35 37 41 42 46–50</a> This includes collaboration and consultation with influential ethnic minority community members, advocates, community and religious leaders, and community organisations in governance and health service management.<a id=\"xref-ref-49-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-49\">49</a> These partnerships could be harnessed to (1) support the development of public health campaigns and messaging<a id=\"xref-ref-50-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-50\">50</a>; (2) to ensure that service delivery approaches are culturally responsive<a id=\"xref-ref-41-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-41\">41</a>; support the implementation of research and the collection of relevant data<a id=\"xref-ref-37-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-37\">37</a>; support the development of policies and programmes<a id=\"xref-ref-41-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-41\">41</a> and lastly to enhance online and social media communication efforts.<a id=\"xref-ref-47-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-47\">47</a></p>\\n<p id=\"p-44\">The Victorian Government’s guidebook on ‘How to engage with CaLD communities in Victoria’<a id=\"xref-ref-42-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-42\">42</a> recommends specific collaboration and consultation activities essential for community member engagement. First, consulting with stakeholders to determine communities’ locations is crucial in ensuring better results and a broader reach of engagement activities. This is similar to how the Priority Communities Engagement team consulted with community groups to determine the best locations for COVID-19 vaccinations.<a id=\"xref-ref-42-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-42\">42</a> Second, it recommends approaching each community’s leaders before attempting to talk with the community. For example, rates of COVID-19 vaccination uptake in the Congolese community in Victoria were slow. By reaching out to the community’s religious leader, the Priority Communities Engagement team could address this group’s specific concerns in a tailored manner.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-45\">Outcomes from these collaborations and consultation processes might support agencies to address institutional racism,<a id=\"xref-ref-49-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-49\">49</a> support vaccine acceptance and uptake,<a id=\"xref-ref-33-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-33\">33</a> ensure appropriate cultural tones and delivery of public health messaging,<a id=\"xref-ref-35-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-35\">35</a> improve information dissemination at the community level, and better community service delivery,<a id=\"xref-ref-32-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32</a> enable health service use in patient’s preferred language,<a id=\"xref-ref-48-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-48\">48</a> improve community trust in public health professionals,<a id=\"xref-ref-46-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-46\">46</a> improve access to COVID-19 vaccination and testing clinics<a id=\"xref-ref-42-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-42\">42</a> and the establishment of community reference groups to guide implantation of resources and communication.<a id=\"xref-ref-27-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-27\">27 37</a></p>\\n<h4>Representation in the workforce</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-46\">An identified and identifiable bicultural workforce is needed on the front line to increase trust and confidence in health agencies within ethnic minority communities<a id=\"xref-ref-25-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-25\">25</a> and to improve services’ cultural responsiveness in order to meet the needs of Australia’s multicultural population.<a id=\"xref-ref-41-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-41\">41</a> This review identified several strategies that would support this, including:</p>\\n<p id=\"p-47\">Harnessing cultural knowledge to communicate in the most culturally appropriate and efficient way.<a id=\"xref-ref-32-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32</a></p>\\n<p id=\"p-48\">Creating an identified pool of workers and volunteers to consult in future.<a id=\"xref-ref-25-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-25\">25</a></p>\\n<p id=\"p-49\">Increasing the number of ethnic minority community members who are engaged in formal health worker, social work and community development training and education.<a id=\"xref-ref-25-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-25\">25</a></p>\\n<p id=\"p-50\">Increasing the number of bicultural workers within government, vaccine promotion and mainstream providers is needed to enhance vaccine acceptance, especially for individuals and groups with those of low literacy, low health literacy and low digital literacy.<a id=\"xref-ref-29-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-29\">29 31 46</a></p>\\n<h4>Supporting community-led communication efforts</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-51\">One of the key recommendations made by the authors (as well as by the stakeholders and community members interviewed in these studies) was to provide more opportunities for community members to participate in forums (face-to-face and online) and other outreach events. The authors emphasised the need to provide occasions for dialogue between health experts, community leaders, community stakeholders and members of the public.<a id=\"xref-ref-33-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-33\">33 38 50</a> While many community organisations reported running information sessions, especially early in the pandemic and at the start of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, the organisers spoke about not having access to the technology or support to maximise these opportunities.<a id=\"xref-ref-38-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-38\">38</a></p>\\n<p id=\"p-52\">An important consideration when working with community/religious leaders and other community stakeholders in engaging communities and communicating crisis information is the need for training, reflected in sentiments from leaders and other stakeholders within the literature examined.<a id=\"xref-ref-38-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-38\">38</a> This training should include education and tool kits for increasing health literacy, communicating about COVID-19, vaccinations and tackling misinformation.</p>\\n<h4>Small grants schemes and sector funding</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-53\">As a solution to the issues highlighted above, many of the reviewed documents proposed that the Australian Government needs to provide funding/small grants to local community organisations.<a id=\"xref-ref-38-5\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-38\">38 50</a> Overall, increased funding was at the core of many suggested improvements, specifically in building sustainable funding models for projects and programmes delivered by community-based organisations.<a id=\"xref-ref-50-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-50\">50</a> This included funding for bilingual caseworkers to provide COVID-19 information directly to community members and supporters. Importantly, given the level of uncertainty and change during pandemics, funding must be flexible and recognise the range of activities being provided by community-controlled organisations and the wider multicultural sector.</p>\\n<h4>Translation and interpretation services</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-54\">Improving the translation and interpretation of COVID-19 messaging and developing best-practice communication materials are commonly cited to strengthen communication and integrate ethnic minority communities in public health crisis management and communication.<a id=\"xref-ref-24-7\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-24\">24 26 29 32 37 41 46</a> This means engaging translators and interpreters throughout a public health crisis,<a id=\"xref-ref-46-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-46\">46</a> ensuring timely and accurate translations of televised broadcasts and other essential health information,<a id=\"xref-ref-26-8\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-26\">26 29</a> increasing transparency and accessibility of translations on government health websites<a id=\"xref-ref-29-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-29\">29</a> and collaborating with community ambassadors to ensure the translation is inappropriate dialects and address culturally specific misconceptions.<a id=\"xref-ref-37-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-37\">37</a> According to the studies, communication materials should be designed with minimal language and should prioritise accessibility for individuals with different levels of health literacy, assessed through the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool.<a id=\"xref-ref-46-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-46\">46</a> Additionally, official government messages should be presented in appropriate languages using visual aids and audio formats.<a id=\"xref-ref-24-8\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-24\">24 32</a></p>\\n<h4>Culturally responsive communication strategies</h4>\\n<p id=\"p-55\">Several studies have provided guidelines on how to effectively communicate with ethnic minority communities in times of public health crises such as COVID-19.<a id=\"xref-ref-24-9\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-24\">24 33 36 39 42 46 51–54</a> It is crucial to consider all relevant languages and communities before developing public health messages, and this information should be easily accessible. Additionally, the messaging should be culturally sensitive, taking into account factors such as age, location, religion, technological proficiency and gender, to ensure that the communication is appropriate for the culture and to increase COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.<a id=\"xref-ref-53-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-53\">53</a> Pickles <em>et al</em> suggest involving young people in developing COVID-19 messaging by testing communications, running focus groups and ensuring representation within public health communication teams.<a id=\"xref-ref-35-3\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-35\">35</a></p>\\n<p id=\"p-56\">Many studies highlight the importance of considering multiple methods of communication dissemination to reach communities, especially those who may be more vulnerable to missing the information (eg, newly arrived migrants/refugees, the elderly).<a id=\"xref-ref-24-10\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-24\">24 26 29 33 37 38 41 46 53 55</a> Public health messages require delivery using appropriate and accessible channels. This means considering the demographic mix and variation among different community groups by sharing public health information and other essential crisis communication on all platforms, including websites, emails, social media, streaming video, radio and print media, and through trusted sources, as discussed above.</p>\\n<h2 class=\"\">Discussion</h2>\\n<p id=\"p-57\">This scoping review has provided an analysis and synthesis of data derived from 38 empirical studies and reports focused specifically on the issues linked with communication and engagement approaches in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we describe a range of reported experiences related to the CaLD population during COVID-19 and claims advanced in relation to these experiences. The results of this review largely align with global findings during emergencies like COVID-19. Kalocsányiová <em>et al</em> identified 11 studies worldwide that examined both the challenges of reaching disadvantaged populations and their messaging behaviours.<a id=\"xref-ref-56-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-56\">56</a> In their review, similar issues were found, including a lack of access to COVID-19 information, translation barriers, government neglect of minority populations and a need for tailored communications for specific subgroups. Additionally, a study in the UK found that ethnic minorities faced language and health literacy barriers during COVID-19 communication.<a id=\"xref-ref-57-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-57\">57</a></p>\\n<p id=\"p-58\">With respect to the first review focus area (ie, factors impacting the communities’ ability to access and act on public health messaging), the results largely focused on the inadequacy of the materials developed, the delays in translation, accessibility, as well as the ineffective communication channels used by the Australian Government. Potential strategies to address these issues often centre on ensuring that translated materials are available, that information is provided at appropriate readability levels, or introducing tailored social media campaigns.<a id=\"xref-ref-58-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-58\">58</a> These strategies are essential but not enough and often fraught with issues. For example, while generic preparedness information may remain relevant for a long time and can therefore be made available in various languages ahead of disasters, it is not always possible to translate ‘live’ emergency information. The availability of information in language often depends on the language community. Speakers of languages with sizeable numbers of practitioners—Mandarin, Arabic, Vietnamese, Cantonese or Greek—may glean information from radio stations, national organisations, newspapers, etc. But other communities are classified as linguistic minorities, which do not have these local outreach services. Within Australia, there are certain communities which have been identified as ‘high need’ groups (ie, Rohingya, Afghan or Burmese communities). While established communities (often the high volume that is, Greek, Italian and Chinese communities) have the infrastructure in the form of community organisations, new and emerging communities may lack established networks, community structures and resources and may not be familiar with mainstream services. It is critical that research is undertaken to understand the factors that impacted on communication and engagement efforts with these groups, as well as those in regional and remote areas. One area of focus is around the role of community-led translation efforts and the role that community-controlled organisations and community stakeholders have in providing communication materials in the language.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-59\">The second focus of this review was to identify strategies that have been implemented to reach, engage and communicate with CaLD communities. A theme across nearly all included studies was the role of community leaders in the development of communication materials or as trusted messengers. This is consistent in the literature<a id=\"xref-ref-59-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-59\">59–61</a> including studies in low resource settings,<a id=\"xref-ref-62-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-62\">62 63</a> where faith leaders and indigenous community leaders were key partnerships in using models and other stakeholder engagement approaches to strengthen public health systems and to message within multicultural communities. Beyond the focus on traditional leaders in the community, there was a strong recognition of the need to work with young people to support community participation in public health activities during pandemics and emergencies. Previous research has already started to highlight the role of young people, specifically the child–parent communication and behaviour intentions to health decisions around vaccinations and organ donations<a id=\"xref-ref-64-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-64\">64</a> and more recently in the USA, with family communication from young people being the strongest predictor of COVID-19 vaccine intention.<a id=\"xref-ref-65-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-65\">65</a> Research has only begun exploring further impacts of young people in broader health domains, with new insights from research in this review into the role of young people during COVID-19 about designing and communicating culturally appropriate messaging, and assisting healthcare workers with engagement efforts, highlighting an underutilised resource for communication and engagement within communities.<a id=\"xref-ref-23-4\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-23\">23 33 35 43</a> Future research could evaluate the impacts of young people in strengthening communication and engagement efforts in ethnic minority communities.</p>\\n<p id=\"p-60\">Going forward and focused on the final focus area (recommendations for future crisis) is the need to address the gaps and strengthen pandemic efforts in the future. The WHO in their planning guidelines to support preparedness and response during pandemics highlights the need for countries to focus on community engagement.<a id=\"xref-ref-66-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-66\">66</a> Despite this strong message from the WHO, most of the studies included in this review called out the absence of community voices within policy and decision-making during COVID. We have previously highlighted the gaps in Australia’s pandemic plan, prior to COVID-19 and the limited attention given to CaLD community members.<a id=\"xref-ref-13-5\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-13\">13</a> Not only has there been limited recognition of the particular needs of these CaLD communities in regard to the development and dissemination of information, as well as social support, there was limited consideration about the need for community partnerships and input in government processes and policies.<a id=\"xref-ref-38-6\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-38\">38</a> We are not the only group to identify this gap and the urgent need to address how we approach community engagement activities with people from CaLD backgrounds during emergency situations.<a id=\"xref-ref-13-6\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-13\">13</a></p>\\n<h3>Limitations</h3>\\n<p id=\"p-61\">This review has several limitations. First, our search strategy was restricted to studies published in English, and although this is the primary language spoken in Australia, we may need to include valuable literature. In addition, only studies conducted in Australia were included in this review; hence, our findings may not be directly transferable to ethnic minority groups in other countries and would require further research. Further, this review also encompasses literature in the public domain which may have yet to be subject to prior peer review, including reports and preprints. Similarly, although we aimed to minimise bias by having at least two researchers involved in the review process, preference and quality were not formally assessed due to the nature of scoping reviews not critically appraising a body of evidence. Finally, there may have also been additional articles (1) not available to the public, (2) taken down or replaced and (3) published after the data collection that should have been included, and therefore the themes identified may not fully cover the gaps in communication and engagement for these groups and solutions to these issues. Although the focus is on Australian literature, the information this review provides could be used by other countries, who may have experienced similar communication and engagement gaps with their ethnic minority groups, to explore the openings and solutions in a larger international context.</p>\\n<h2 class=\"\">Conclusion</h2>\\n<p id=\"p-62\">The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed significant communication and engagement deficits within ethnic minority communities. These problems have contributed to misinformation susceptibility, vaccination hesitancy, understanding of public health messaging and adherence to public health measures. To effectively address the inequalities experienced by these minority groups and improve future communication and engagement strategies, the experiences from the COVID-19 pandemic and proposed strategies reported on in this review should be reflected on and infused in future interventions and policy. These improvements will support community members to respond and adapt to events where complex health information and guidance change rapidly far beyond the current pandemic.</p>\\n<h2 class=\"\">Data availability statement</h2>\\n<p id=\"p-70\">Data are available upon reasonable request.

       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Objective</strong> To summarise current international guideline recommendations for hand hygiene in community settings and to assess to what extent they are consistent and evidence based.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Eligibility criteria</strong> We included international guidelines with one or more recommendations on hand hygiene in community settings—categorised as domestic, public or institutional—published by international organisations, in English or French, between 1 January 1990 and 15 November 2021.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Data sources</strong> To identify relevant guidelines, we searched the WHO Institutional Repository for Information Sharing Database, Google, websites of international organisations, and contacted expert organisations and individuals.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Charting methods</strong> Recommendations were mapped to four areas related to hand hygiene: (1) effective hand hygiene; (2) minimum requirements; (3) behaviour change and (4) government measures. Recommendations were assessed for consistency, concordance and whether supported by evidence.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> We identified 51 guidelines containing 923 recommendations published between 1999 and 2021 by multilateral agencies and international non-governmental organisations. Handwashing with soap is consistently recommended as the preferred method for hand hygiene across all community settings. Most guidelines specifically recommend handwashing with plain soap and running water for at least 20 s; single-use paper towels for hand drying; and alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) as a complement or alternative to handwashing. There are inconsistent and discordant recommendations for water quality for handwashing, affordable and effective alternatives to soap and ABHR, and the design of handwashing stations. There are gaps in recommendations on soap and water quantity, behaviour change approaches and government measures required for effective hand hygiene. Less than 10% of recommendations are supported by any cited evidence.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusion</strong> While current international guidelines consistently recommend handwashing with soap across community settings, there remain gaps in recommendations where clear evidence-based guidance might support more effective policy and investment.</p>\n",

Among analysed responses, 499 (34%) women reported currently using cannabis and 978 (66%) indicated ever using cannabis. Of the 499 current cannabis users, over 75% were using cannabis for medical purposes. Most common reasons for current use were sleep (65%), anxiety (45%) and muscle/joint achiness (33%). In current users, 74% indicated that cannabis was helpful for symptoms. Current cannabis users were more likely to report experiencing menopause symptoms compared with non-users. History of smoking and general health status were associated with current cannabis use.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> Some women are using cannabis for symptoms related to menopause. Further research is required to assess safety and efficacy of cannabis for managing menopause and develop clinical resources for women on cannabis and menopause.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objectives</strong> This review examined the factors influencing communication and engagement with ethnic and racial minority groups in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic. It aimed to answer two main questions: (1) what communication problems people from these communities typically faced during the pandemic? and (2) what strategies and recommendations were suggested to enhance communication and engagement for ethnic and racial minorities during the current COVID-19 pandemic and any similar events in the future?</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> Scoping review.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Data sources</strong> PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PsychINFO and CINAHL. Grey literature was searched within organisations’ websites and a Google search of key terms.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Eligibility criteria for selecting studies</strong> We included original research, case studies, reports (including government and charity reports), systematic and scoping articles and literature reviews in English, published from January 2020 to August 2022.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Data extraction and synthesis</strong> Two researchers independently assessed the literature for eligibility and extracted data from the included literature. The selected papers were analysed and summarised into themes relevant to the research questions. The final review included 38 studies combining published academic papers and grey literature.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> Key themes relating to communication and engagement issues included a lack of trust in authority, a lack of access to information and ineffective communication channels and a lack of timely and culturally responsive materials. To reduce the issues, the papers spoke about the key role of community organisations to provide local support and community leaders as trusted spokespersons. Lastly, key recommendations to reduce inequity and strengthen future pandemic responses focused on the need for collaborations and consultations, increasing the number of bilingual workers and supporting community-led communication efforts.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> The insights gained from the activities and experiences documented in this review during the COVID-19 pandemic should be incorporated into future decision-making and interventions to enhance communication and engagement strategies.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objectives</strong> To investigate incident cataract surgery and to investigate determinants of cataract surgery uptake in Chinese adults.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> This nationally representative longitudinal study recorded self-reported incident cataract surgery, and measured biological, clinical and socioeconomical characteristics at baseline and endline.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Setting</strong> In the first stage, 150 county-level units were randomly chosen with a probability-proportional-to-size sampling technique from a sampling frame containing all county-level units. The sample was stratified by region and within region by urban district or rural county and per capita gross domestic product. The final sample of 150 counties fell within 28 provinces of China.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Participants</strong> Urban and rural Chinese persons aged 45 years and older.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Primary and secondary outcome measures</strong> Incident cataract surgery (primary outcome) and the factors associated with incident cataract surgery (secondary outcome).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> Among 16 663 people enrolled in 2011, 13 705 (82.2%) attended follow-up in 2015. Among these, 167 (1.22%) reported incident cataract surgery. Those receiving surgery were significantly older (66.2±8.79 vs 58.3±9.18, p≤0.001) and more likely to report: illiteracy (44.9% vs 27.1%, p&lt;0.001), poor baseline distance vision (49.7% vs 20.0%, p≤0.001), poor baseline near vision (37.1% vs 21.8%, p≤0.001), baseline visual impairment (15.6% vs 5.5%, p≤0.001), diabetes (12.0% vs 7.42%, p≤0.05) and higher baseline depression scores (9.7 vs 8.4 on a scale of 0–30, p≤0.05). In linear regression models, older age, worse distance vision, hypertension or diabetes, illiteracy and lower depression score were significantly associated with undergoing surgery. Results were similar in models including only persons aged ≥60 years, except that urban residence was also associated with surgery. When only those aged ≥60 years with poor vision were included, results were again the same, except that higher household expenditure was also associated with surgery.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> In China, cataract surgical rates remain low; underserved groups such as rural dwellers are less likely to receive cataract surgery.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objectives</strong> We sought to compare the temporal trends in the incidence of death and rehospitalisation for congestive heart failure (CHF) following anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in a Medicare cohort of beneficiaries treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in 2005 (n=1479) with those treated in 2016 through quarter (Q) 2 of 2017 (n=22 432).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> This retrospective analysis examined outcomes using both descriptive and regression analysis to control for differences in patient clinical characteristics over time.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Primary outcome measures</strong> The primary outcomes are 1 year and 2 year rates of mortality and re-hospitalisation for CHF.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Results</strong> The 1 year mortality rate was numerically higher in the 2016 cohort at 10.3% (95% CI 9.9 to 10.7) versus 8.9% (CI 7.4 to 10.3; p=0.068). The 2 year mortality rate was significantly higher in the 2016 cohort at 14.5% (CI 13.9 to 15.1) versus 11.4% (CI 9.2 to 13.6; p&lt;0.01). The 1 year rehospitalisation for CHF was lower in the 2016 cohort at 10.6% (CI 10.0 to 11.2) versus 16.7% (CI 14.0 to 19.4; p&lt;0.001), but the 2 year rate was not significantly different at 19.3% (CI 17.7 to 20.9) versus 20.7% (CI 16.4 to 24.9; p=0.55). After adjustment for covariates with two models, the 1 year mortality increased by 2.3% (CI 0.8 to 3.7; p&lt;0.01) and 4.1% (CI 2.6 to 5.6; p&lt;0.001) in the 2016 cohort. The 2 year adjusted mortality also increased by 4.2% (CI 2.0 to 6.4; p&lt;0.001) and 6.5% (CI 4.2 to 8.7; p&lt;0.001) in the 2016 cohort. The risk adjusted trends for rehospitalisation for CHF were similar to the unadjusted findings.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> Despite prior improvements in STEMI outcomes in the reperfusion era related to the broad adoption of timely PCI, there is a persistent high mortality and CHF burden in Medicare beneficiaries with anterior STEMI. New strategies that address reperfusion injury and enhance myocardial salvage are needed.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objective</strong> A scoping review was undertaken to determine the extent to which existing studies have examined factors influencing healthcare providers’ use of clinical guidelines in low and middle-income country (LMIC) settings and determine which factors constrain or facilitate the use of clinical guidelines by healthcare providers.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> Scoping review.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Data sources</strong> The literature search was conducted using PubMed in January 2021.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Eligibility criteria</strong> We identified empirical studies, published between 2011–2021 in English, which included clinicians and/or nurses as healthcare providers, used a health facility as the study site, and were located in an LMIC.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Data extraction and synthesis</strong> Information extracted from the literature review was organised using themes and the findings synthesised using thematic analysis.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> The review identified five types of interacting factors that influence healthcare providers’ use of and compliance with clinical guidelines. The factors identified are organisational factors, factors relating to individual healthcare providers, attributes of the clinical guidelines, patient-related factors and institutional factors. Organisational factors can be further divided into the physical work environment, organisational culture and working conditions. The effective use of clinical guidelines in LMIC settings is greatly impacted by the contextualisation of clinical guidelines, end-user engagement and alignment of the implementation of clinical guidelines with the institutional arrangements in the broader health system.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusion</strong> The development and evaluation of concrete interventions is vital to facilitate the implementation of clinical guidelines and improve healthcare service quality. Further studies are necessary to examine the relative importance of the five identified factors on the effective use of clinical guidelines in different contexts.</p>\n",

Many activities of daily living can be affected, including ability to drive. Currently there are no guidelines regarding safe return to driving following upper limb surgery. This scoping review aims to systematically review the current literature on the topic of driving following surgery to the upper limb.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Methods and analysis</strong> Informed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses—Scoping Review extension guidelines, this protocol details the scoping review’s methodological and analytical approaches. The review will consider all primary and secondary source articles that examine return to driving following surgery to the upper limb, including the impact of orthoses on functional ability to drive. All studies will be included regardless of methodology and text and opinion pieces will also be considered. Studies conducted in any geographical location or setting will be included in the review. Systematic searches of scientific databases such as OVID (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane), NCBI (PubMed), Scopus, PsycINFO, EBSCOhost (CINAHL), Web of Science, Google Scholar and ProQuest will be conducted. In addition, relevant organisational websites, dissertations, theses from university repositories and grey literature will be included. Further articles will be identified by searching references of relevant studies. Studies conducted in English in any year will be included. Two independent reviewers will screen identified literature sources based on predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Discrepancies will be resolved through discussion, therefore, negating the need for a third reviewer. Article data will be presented in tabular or graphical format along with a narrative summary.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Introduction</strong> Spinal cord infarction (SCInf) is a rare ischaemic event that manifests with acute neurological deficits. It is typically classified as either spontaneous, defined as SCInf without any inciting event, or periprocedural, which typically occur in conjunction with vascular surgery with aortic manipulations. While periprocedural SCInf has recently been the subject of intensified research, especially focusing on the primary prevention of this complication, spontaneous SCInf remains less studied.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Methods and analysis</strong> Electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science and Embase, will be searched using the keywords “spinal cord”, “infarction”, “ischemia” and “spontaneous”. The search will be set to provide only English studies published from database inception. Editorials, letters and reviews will also be excluded. Reference lists of relevant records will also be searched. Identified studies will be screened for inclusion, by one reviewer in the first step and then three in the next step to decrease the risk of bias. The synthesis will address several topics of interest including epidemiology, presentation, diagnostics, treatment strategies, outcomes and predictors. The review aims to gather the body of evidence to summarise the current knowledge on SCInf. This will lead to a better understanding of the condition, its risk factors, diagnosis and management. Moreover, the review will also provide an understanding of the prognosis of patients with SCInf with respect to neurological function, quality of life and mortality. Finally, this overview of the literature will allow the identification of knowledge gaps to help guide future research efforts.</p>\n",

Regular structured, comprehensive health assessments are available to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as annual health checks funded through the Medicare Benefits Schedule. This realist review aims to identify context-specific enablers and tensions and contribute to developing an evidence framework to guide the implementation of health checks in the prevention and early detection of chronic diseases for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Methods and analysis</strong> The review will involve the following steps: (1) Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander engagement and research governance; (2) defining the scope of the review; (3) search strategy; (4) screening, study selection and appraisal; (5) data extraction and organisation of evidence; (6) data synthesis and drawing conclusions. This realist review will follow the Realist and MEta-narrative Evidence Syntheses: Evolving Standards guidance and will be reported as set up by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols statement. The realist programme theory will be developed through a literature review using multiple database searches from 1 November 1999 to 31 June 2022, limited to the English language, and stakeholder consultation, which will be refined throughout the review process. The study findings will be reported by applying the context–mechanism–outcome configuration to gain a deeper understanding of context and underlying mechanisms that influence the implementation of health checks in the prevention and early detection of chronic diseases among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objectives</strong> To systematically synthesise the results of primary qualitative studies on how community-dwelling older adults experience shared decision-making processes, express preferences and actively participate in care.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> Systematic review of qualitative studies and qualitative meta-synthesis.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Methods</strong> We focused on studies about community-dwelling participants aged ≥65 undergoing a health-disease process circumscribed to a primary healthcare setting, and the central theme should focus on either shared decision-making, expressing preferences or patient participation. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus and PsycINFO (time publication frame 2012–2022). We excluded studies in those cases where the qualitative results were not analysed or unrelated to the phenomenon addressed, phenomena were not clear enough to be included or the setting did not occur in the community.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Results</strong> A total of 12 studies were included in this meta-synthesis. We appraised the quality of the selected studies through Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) Checklist. The metasummary comprised the frequency and intensity of qualitative patterns across the included studies. The meta-synthesis revealed four influential elements in their interaction: recognising personal qualities, facing professional characteristics, experiences of discrimination and a double-edged context.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> The phenomena studied were influenced by how older people approached their role in their binomial relationship with healthcare professionals. Those with a reinforced self-concept were better aware of health-disease-related situations regarding shared decision-making and the importance of being communicatively assertive. Professional characteristics were also crucial in how older people modulated their acting ability through their personality, communication skills and the approach healthcare professionals used towards older adults. Situations of discrimination generated through an imbalance of power inhibited the expression of preferences and hindered the active participation of older people. The context surrounding the participants influenced all these situations, key in tipping the balance between a therapeutic and a harmful side.</p>\n",

Acupuncture has shown potential in correcting hemiplegic gait patterns and improving motor function recovery after stroke. However, controversial findings and a lack of supportive evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture for post-stroke hemiplegia. The intelligent gait analysis system provides a new perspective for the study of hemiparetic gait. This systematic review aims to collect relevant studies and critically evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in alleviating gait disturbance of post-stroke hemiplegia based on quantified gait parameters.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Methods and analysis</strong> A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane stroke group trials register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, AMED, three Chinese databases (Chinese Biomedical Literatures database (CBM), National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wan fang Digital Periodicals), four trails registries (The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, The Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, and The Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry) will be conducted to identify randomised controlled trials of acupuncture for gait disturbance in post-stroke patients. No restrictions on language or publication status. The primary outcomes are gait temporospatial parameters (eg, step length, stride length, step width, step frequency (cadence), walking speed, etc), and gait kinematic parameters (eg, hip peak flex/extend angle, knee peak flex/extend angle, ankle peak dorsi/plantar-flexion angle, etc). We will assess bias using the approach recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

Application of medical adhesives to the skin can lead to skin stripping, mild or severe allergic reactions and skin irritation that may manifest as redness, itching or rash. Adhesive-related skin injury can lead to infection, delayed wound healing and an increased risk of scarring. These injuries can cause severe discomfort and pain, and can affect the patient’s quality of life. A systematic review summarising patient’s experiences on this topic will contribute to informing adhesive producers and policy makers, and guiding further development and improvement of available technologies.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> A cross-sectional study was conducted from 6 July 2022 to 17 August 2022. The data were collected using a standardised American Thoracic Society questionnaire. The collected data were entered into EpiData V.4.6 and analysed using Stata V.14. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with occupational respiratory morbidity. The association was determined using an adjusted OR (AOR) with a 95% CI at a p value of &lt;0.05.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Setting</strong> The study was conducted in Gondar city, Northwestern Ethiopia.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Participants</strong> A total of 403 hairdressers participated in this study.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Outcome measures</strong> The primary outcome is the prevalence of occupational respiratory morbidity.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> The total response rate was 95.5%. The majority, 250 (62%) of the respondents were women. The mean age (±SD) of the respondents was 27 (±6.0) years. The overall prevalence of occupational respiratory morbidity during the past 12 months was found to be 134 (33.3%) (95% CI (28.7% to 38.1%)). Female hairdressers (18.6%) showed greater respiratory morbidity than male hairdressers (14.7%). Working experience 3–5 years (AOR: 3.05; 95% CI (1.76 to 5.30)) and working experience &gt;5 years (AOR: 6.22; 95% CI (2.73 to 14.16)), overweight (body mass index (BMI)) (AOR: 3.01; 95% CI (1.19 to 7.58)) and working near roadsides (AOR: 2.15; 95% CI (1.33 to 3.37)) were risk factors of occupational respiratory morbidity among hairdressers.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> This study concluded that one-third of hairdressers experienced occupational respiratory morbidity. Longer work experience, higher BMI and working near roadsides were identified as significant risk factors for respiratory morbidity in hairdressers. Dietary calorie restrictions for overweight individuals and the development and implementation of air pollution mitigation measures targeted at roadside workers are advised to curb the problem.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objectives</strong> Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming the leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. However, treatment of NAFLD is potentially influenced by psychological conditions. Using the simplified version of the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA-SV) scale, this study aimed to evaluate the stage of psychological change as a prerequisite to refining implementation strategies for psychological change.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> A multicentre cross-sectional survey.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Setting</strong> Ninety hospitals in China.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Participants</strong> 5181 patients with NAFLD were included in this study.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Outcome measures</strong> All patients completed the URICA-SV questionnaire and were assigned to one of the three stages of change (precontemplation, contemplation or action) according to their readiness scores. A stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent factors associated with the stage of psychological change.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> A total of 4832 (93.3%) patients were included in the precontemplation stage and only 349 (6.7%) considered making a change or preparing to make one. There were significant differences in gender (Cohen’s d=0.039, p=0.005), age (Cohen’s d=−0.327, p&lt;0.001), waist circumference (Cohen’s d=0.143, p=0.003), alanine transaminase (Cohen’s d=0.347, p=0.001), triglyceride (Cohen’s d=0.351, p=0.002), body mass index (BMI; Cohen’s d=0.056, p&lt;0.001), proportion of hyperlipidaemia (Cohen’s d=0.068, p&lt;0.001) and cardiovascular disease (Cohen’s d=0.032, p=0.029), therapeutic regimen (Cohen’s d=0.136, p&lt;0.001), and Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire-Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease overall score (Cohen’s d=−0.420, p&lt;0.001) between patients with NAFLD in the precontemplation stage and those in the contemplation/action stage. Logistic regression identified BMI (HR 0.659, 95% CI 0.469 to 0.928, p=0.017), cardiovascular disease (HR 2.161, 95% CI 1.089 to 4.287, p=0.027) and triglyceride (HR 0.751, 95% CI 0.591 to 0.955, p=0.020) as independent factors predicting psychological change.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> The results demonstrated that very few patients with NAFLD presented psychological condition in the stage of action. Psychological condition was found to be significantly related to BMI, cardiovascular disease and triglyceride factors. Integrated diversity considerations for evaluating psychological change are necessary.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Participants</strong> Participants with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus irrespective of age, sex and comorbidities.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Interventions</strong> Drug interventions authorised by EMA or FDA.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Primary outcome measures</strong> Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and serious adverse events.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> We included 17 clinical trials randomising 16 257 participants to 8 different interventions authorised by EMA or FDA. 15/17 of the included trials (88.2%) were assessed at high risk of bias. Only molnupiravir and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir seemed to improve both our primary outcomes. Meta-analyses showed that molnupiravir reduced the risk of death (relative risk (RR) 0.11, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.64; p=0.0145, 2 trials; very low certainty of evidence) and serious adverse events (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.84; p=0.0018, 5 trials; very low certainty of evidence). Fisher’s exact test showed that ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir reduced the risk of death (p=0.0002, 1 trial; very low certainty of evidence) and serious adverse events (p<em>&lt;</em>0.0001, 1 trial; very low certainty of evidence) in 1 trial including 2246 patients, while another trial including 1140 patients reported 0 deaths in both groups.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> The certainty of the evidence was very low, but, from the results of this study, molnupiravir showed the most consistent benefit and ranked highest among the approved interventions for prevention of COVID-19 progression to severe disease in outpatients. The lack of certain evidence should be considered when treating patients with COVID-19 for prevention of disease progression.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objective</strong> To summarise the available evidence on the risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, compared with the risk among unvaccinated individuals in the absence of COVID-19 infection.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> Systematic review and meta-analysis.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Data sources</strong> Electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Web of Science and WHO Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease), preprint repositories (medRxiv and bioRxiv), reference lists and grey literature were searched from 1 December 2020 until 31 October 2022.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Study selection</strong> Epidemiological studies of individuals of any age who received at least one dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, reported a risk of myo/pericarditis and compared the risk of myo/pericarditis to individuals who did not receive any dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Data extraction and synthesis</strong> Two reviewers independently conducted screening and data extraction. The rate of myo/pericarditis among vaccinated and unvaccinated groups was recorded, and the rate ratios were calculated. Additionally, the total number of individuals, case ascertainment criteria, percentage of males and history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were extracted for each study. Meta-analysis was done using a random-effects model.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> Seven studies met the inclusion criteria, of which six were included in the quantitative synthesis. Our meta-analysis indicates that within 30-day follow-up period, vaccinated individuals were twice as likely to develop myo/pericarditis in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to unvaccinated individuals, with a rate ratio of 2.05 (95% CI 1.49–2.82).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusion</strong> Although the absolute number of observed myo/pericarditis cases remains quite low, a higher risk was detected in those who received mRNA COVID-19 vaccinations compared with unvaccinated individuals in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in preventing severe illnesses, hospitalisations and deaths, future research should focus on accurately determining the rates of myo/pericarditis linked to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, understanding the biological mechanisms behind these rare cardiac events and identifying those most at risk.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objectives</strong> We examined age, residence, education and wealth inequalities and their combinations on cervical precancer screening probabilities for women. We hypothesised that inequalities in screening favoured women who were older, lived in urban areas, were more educated and wealthier.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> Cross-sectional study using Population-Based HIV Impact Assessment data.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Setting</strong> Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Differences in screening rates were analysed using multivariable logistic regressions, controlling for age, residence, education and wealth. Inequalities in screening probability were estimated using marginal effects models.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Participants</strong> Women aged 25–49 years, reporting screening.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Outcome measures</strong> Self-reported screening rates, and their inequalities in percentage points, with differences of 20%+ defined as high inequality, 5%–20% as medium, 0%–5% as low.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> The sample size of participants ranged from 5882 in Ethiopia to 9186 in Tanzania. The screening rates were low in the surveyed countries, ranging from 3.5% (95% CI 3.1% to 4.0%) in Rwanda to 17.1% (95% CI 15.8% to 18.5%) and 17.4% (95% CI 16.1% to 18.8%) in Zambia and Zimbabwe. Inequalities in screening rates were low based on covariates. Combining the inequalities led to significant inequalities in screening probabilities between women living in rural areas aged 25–34 years, with a primary education level, from the lowest wealth quintile, and women living in urban areas aged 35–49 years, with the highest education level, from the highest wealth quintile, ranging from 4.4% in Rwanda to 44.6% in Zimbabwe.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> Cervical precancer screening rates were inequitable and low. No country surveyed achieved one-third of the WHO’s target of screening 70% of eligible women by 2030. Combining inequalities led to high inequalities, preventing women who were younger, lived in rural areas, were uneducated, and from the lowest wealth quintile from screening. Governments should include and monitor equity in their cervical precancer screening programmes.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Introduction</strong> The key tools for mitigating the impact of COVID-19 and reducing its transmission include testing, quarantine and isolation, as well as telemonitoring. Primary healthcare (PHC) can be essential in increasing access to these tools. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to implement and expand an intervention consisting of COVID-19 testing, isolation, quarantine and telemonitoring (TQT) strategies and other prevention measures at PHC services in highly socioeconomically vulnerable neighbourhoods of Brazil.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Methods and analysis</strong> This study will implement and expand COVID-19 testing in PHC services in two large Brazilian capital cities: Salvador and Rio de Janeiro. Qualitative formative research was conducted to understand the testing context in the communities and at PCH services. The TQT strategy was structured in three subcomponents: (1) training and technical support for tailoring the work processes of health professional teams, (2) recruitment and demand creation strategies and (3) TQT. To evaluate this intervention, we will conduct an epidemiological study with two stages: (1) a cross-sectional sociobehavioural survey among individuals from these two communities covered by PHC services, presenting symptoms associated with COVID-19 or being a close contact of a patient with COVID-19, and (2) a cohort of those who tested positive, collecting clinical data.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Ethics and dissemination</strong> The WHO Ethics Research Committee (ERC) (#CERC.0128A and #CERC.0128B) and each city’s local ERC approved the study protocol (Salvador, ISC/UFBA: #53844121.4.1001.5030; and Rio de Janeiro, INI/Fiocruz: #53844121.4.3001.5240, ENSP/Fiocruz: #53844121.4.3001.5240 and SMS/RJ #53844121.4.3002.5279). Findings will be published in scientific journals and presented at meetings. In addition, informative flyers and online campaigns will be developed to communicate study findings to participants, members of communities and key stakeholders.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objective</strong> To assess implementation status of public health emergency operations centres (PHEOCs) in all countries in Africa.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> Cross-sectional.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Setting</strong> Fifty-four national PHEOC focal points in Africa responded to an online survey between May and November 2021. Included variables aimed to assess capacities for each of the four PHEOC core components. To assess the PHEOCs’ functionality, criteria were defined from among the collected variables by expert consensus based on PHEOC operations’ prioritisation. We report results of the descriptive analysis, including frequencies of proportions.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Results</strong> A total of 51 (93%) African countries responded to the survey. Among these, 41 (80%) have established a PHEOC. Twelve (29%) of these met 80% or more of the minimum requirements and were classified as fully functional. Twelve (29%) and 17 (41%) PHEOCs that met 60%–79% and below 60% the minimum requirements were classified as functional and partially functional, respectively.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> Countries in Africa made considerable progress in setting up and improving functioning of PHEOCs. One-third of the responding countries with a PHEOC have one fulfilling at least 80% of the minimum requirements to operate the critical emergency functions. There are still several African countries that either do not have a PHEOC or whose PHEOCs only partially meet these minimal requirements. This calls for significant collaboration across all stakeholders to establish functional PHEOCs in Africa.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Setting</strong> A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted in public and tertiary hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 15 January 2022 to 30 July 2022.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Participants</strong> A total of 326 adult hypertensive patients who visited the chronic diseases clinic for follow-up were included in the study.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Primary and secondary outcome measures</strong> A high predicted 10-year CVD risk level was assessed using an interviewer-administered questionnaire and physical measurement (primary data) and reviews of medical data records (secondary data) by using a non-laboratory WHO risk prediction chart. Logistic regression with an adjusted OR (AOR) using a 95% CI was calculated for independent variables associated with 10-year CVD risk.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Results</strong> The prevalence of a high predicted 10-year CVD risk level was 28.2% (95% CI 10.34% to 33.2%) among the study participants. A higher CVD risk level was found to be associated with age (AOR 4.2 for age 64–74, 95% CI 1.67 to 10.66), being male (AOR 2.1, 95% CI 1.18, 3.67), unemployment (AOR 3.2, 95% CI 1.06 to 6.25) and stage 2 systolic blood pressure (AOR 11.32; 95% CI 3.43 to 37.46).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Conclusion</strong> The study showed that the respondent’s age, gender, occupation and high systolic blood pressure were determinant factors for CVD risks. Therefore, routine screening for the presence of CVD risk factors and assessment of CVD risk are recommended for hypertensive patients for CVD risk reduction.</p>\n",

The primary outcomes will be symptoms of aggressive behaviour, quality of life for the individual or their careers, and discontinuation or dropouts/withdrawals of antipsychotics due to adverse events. The secondary outcomes are other not serious adverse events and adherence to pharmacotherapy. Selection, data extraction, and quality assessment will be performed by pairs of reviewers, independently. The Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) and Risk of Bias in Non-Randomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tools will be used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. If appropriate, a meta-analysis and network meta-analysis will be conducted to synthesise the results.

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Introduction</strong> Evidence indicates that, compared with their non-disabled counterparts, disabled people are likely to face greater mental health challenges as well as significant inequalities in accessing appropriate therapeutic support. Currently, little is known about how disabled people perceive and experience counselling and psychotherapy, what barriers/facilitators to therapy delivery and/or therapy participation exist for disabled clients and whether clinicians sufficiently adapt their practice to meet the needs of this diverse but marginalised population. In this paper, we outline a proposal for undertaking a scoping review that aims to identify and synthesise current research relating to disabled individuals’ perceptions of accessibility and experiences of counselling and psychotherapy. The review aims to identify current gaps in the evidence base and inform how future research, practice and policy may develop and foster inclusive strategies and approaches which will support the psychological well-being of disabled clients accessing counselling and psychotherapy.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Methods and analysis</strong> The undertaking and reporting of the proposed scoping review will be guided by the framework outlined by Arksey and O’Malley and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Systematic searches of the PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, EBSCO and Cochrane Library electronic databases will be conducted. Reference lists of relevant studies will be reviewed to identify additional studies. Eligible studies will be limited to those published from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2022 and in the English language. Empirical studies involving disabled individuals receiving and/or who have received a form of therapeutic intervention will be included. Data will be extracted, collated and charted, and will be summarised quantitatively through descriptive numerical analysis and qualitatively through a narrative synthesis.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Ethics and dissemination</strong> The proposed scoping review of published research will not require ethical approval. Results will be disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-7\">The proposed review will be coproduced with a disabled researcher and academic, as well as involve consultation with four disabled people, all of whom have lived or personal experience of participating in and delivering counselling, psychotherapy or mental health services and/or of living with/caring for someone else using similar services. These collaborators were involved in shaping the design of this current protocol and their perspectives will be central to ensuring that the findings and potential recommendations emerging from the full scoping review resonate and reflect the lived experience of disabled people.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Purpose</strong> The purpose of the Radiotherapy Dataset (RTDS) is to collect consistent and comparable data across all providers of National Health Service (NHS)-funded radiotherapy and to provide intelligence for service planning, commissioning, clinical practice and research.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Participants</strong> The RTDS is a mandated dataset requiring providers to collect and submit data monthly for patients treated in England. Data is available from 01 April 2009 to 2 months behind the calendar month.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\">The National Disease Registration Service (NDRS) started receiving data from 01 April 2016. Prior to this, the National Clinical Analysis and Specialised Applications Team (NATCANSAT) were responsible for the RTDS. NDRS holds a copy of the NATCANSAT data for English NHS providers.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\">The RTDS contains clinical information on the primary disease being treated, modality and intent of treatment, dose fractionation and hospital appointment details. Due to constraints in RTDS coding, linkage to the English National Cancer Registration dataset is beneficial.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Findings to date</strong> The RTDS has been linked to the English National Cancer Registration and Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy (SACT) datasets and to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) to provide a more complete picture of the patient cancer pathway. Findings include a study to compare outcomes for patients treated with radical radiotherapy, an investigation of factors influencing 30-day mortality, assessing sociodemographic variation in the use of treatment and a study to assess the service impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A range of other studies have been completed or are ongoing currently.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Future plans</strong> The RTDS can be used for a variety of functions including cancer epidemiological studies to investigate inequalities in treatment access; provide service planning intelligence; monitor clinical practice; and support clinical trial design and recruitment. Collection is to continue indefinitely, with regular updates to the data specification to enable capture of more detailed information on radiotherapy planning and delivery.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Introduction</strong> In the new revised National Institute for Health &amp; Care Excellence (NICE, TA566, 2019) guidelines for cochlear implantation (CI) have clearly stipulated that the hearing loss must be bilateral. Prior to this revision, children and young people (CYP) with asymmetrical thresholds have been considered for unilateral CI when one ear was in audiological criteria. Children with asymmetrical hearing loss represent an important cohort of potential CI candidates, who will continue to be prevented from benefiting from CI unless evidence is produced to support implantation and maximise subsequent benefit.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\">The aim of this study is to evaluate the ‘real-life’ hearing performance in a group of children who have received a unilateral CI and who have hearing thresholds in the contralateral ear that are outside the current UK NICE 2019 audiological criteria for CI. The contralateral ear will be aided using a conventional hearing aid (HA). The outcomes from this ‘bimodal’ group will be compared with a group of children who have received bilateral CI, and a group of children using bilateral HA, to extend the current knowledge about the different performance levels between bilateral CI, bilateral HA and bimodal hearing in CYP.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Methods and analysis</strong> Thirty CYP aged 6–17 years old, 10 bimodal users, 10 bilateral HA users and 10 bilateral cochlear implant users will be subjected to a test battery consisting of: (1) spatial release from masking, (2) complex pitch direction discrimination, (3) melodic identification, (4) perception of prosodic features in speech and (5) TEN test. Subjects will be tested in their optimal device modality. Standard demographic and hearing health information will be collected. In the absence of comparable published data to power the study, sample size was determined on pragmatic grounds. Tests are exploratory and for hypothesis generating purposes. Therefore, the standard criterion of p&lt;0.05 will be used.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Ethics and dissemination</strong> This has been approved by the Health Research Authority and NHS REC within the UK (22/EM/0104). Industry funding was secured via a competitive researcher-led grant application process. Trial results will be subject to publication according to the definition of the outcome presented in this protocol.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Introduction</strong> Intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) is a common cause of stroke worldwide. However, whether the treatment options for symptomatic ICAS is stent placement or medical therapy alone is still controversial. At present, three multicentre randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been published, but their research designs are also slightly different and the conclusions are not completely consistent. Therefore, we plan to conduct a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials to ascertain safety and efficacy of stenting versus medical therapy alone for symptomatic patients with intracranial arterial stenosis.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Methods and analyses</strong> We will identify RCTs comparing stenting vs medical therapy alone in patients with symptomatic ICAS stenosis (70%–99%) through a systematic search, mainly including PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov. Individual-level patient data for a prespecified list of variables will be sought from authors of all eligible studies. The primary outcome was a composite of stroke or death within 30 days, or stroke in territory of qualifying artery beyond 30 days after randomisation. IPD meta-analysis will be conducted with a one-stage approach.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Ethics and dissemination</strong> Ethical approval and individual patient consent will not be required in most cases since this IPD meta-analysis will use pseudoanonymised data from RCTs. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and international conferences.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objectives</strong> There are few reports on regional differences in the supply/utilisation balance and provision of rehabilitation services. This study analysed those regional differences in Japan to help policymakers provide more uniform and efficient rehabilitation services and optimally allocate related resources.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> An ecological study.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Setting</strong> 47 prefectures and 9 regions in Japan in 2017.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Primary and secondary outcome measures</strong> Primary measures were ‘supply/utilisation (S/U) ratio’, calculated by dividing rehabilitation supply converted to service units, by rehabilitation utilisation and ‘utilisation/expected utilisation (U/EU) ratio’, calculated by dividing utilisation by EU. The EU was defined as utilisation expected from the demography in each area. Data required to calculate these indicators were collected from open sources such as the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan Open Data Japan.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Results</strong> The S/U ratios were higher in Shikoku, Kyusyu, Tohoku and Hokuriku regions, and lower in Kanto and Tokai regions. The number of rehabilitation providers per population was higher mostly in the western part of Japan and lower mostly in the eastern part. The U/EU ratios were also higher mostly in the western part, and lower mostly in the eastern part such as Tohoku and Hokuriku regions. The same trend was seen for cerebrovascular disease and musculoskeletal disorder rehabilitation, which accounted for approximately 84% of rehabilitation services. For disuse syndrome rehabilitation, such a trend did not exist, and the U/EU ratio differed by prefectures.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> The large surplus in rehabilitation supply in the western part was attributed to the greater number of providers, while the smaller surplus in Kanto and Tokai regions was due to the smaller amount of supply. The number of rehabilitation services used was lesser in the eastern part such as Tohoku and Hokuriku regions, indicating regional differences in the provision of rehabilitation services.</p>\n",

However, an article with low reporting quality may mislead both experts and the general public into an erroneous decision. Data sharing can contribute to the truthfulness and transparency of trials. Acupuncture RCTs have been increasing rapidly these years, but the reporting quality and data-sharing level of acupuncture RCTs are not clear. Thus, this study will provide the current status of the reporting quality and data-sharing level of acupuncture RCTs.</p>\n",

The seven databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CBM, CNKI, Wanfang Database and VIP will be searched between 1 January 2012 and 15 October 2022 to identify acupuncture RCTs. The basic characteristics of included trials will be summarised. The reporting quality for included RCTs will be assessed by the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials 2010 statement and the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture. The data-sharing level will be assessed by open science practices.</p>\n",

       "<h2 class=\"\">Background</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-11\">According to the second global survey in 2012 conducted by WHO,<a id=\"xref-ref-1-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-1\">1</a> acupuncture is being used as the most common therapy of traditional and complementary medicine practice reported by 113 member states among 133 replied countries. As it gained more attention, existing academic research in acupuncture has been steadily increasing<a id=\"xref-ref-2-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-2\">2</a> and the diverse applications of acupuncture are extensive from pain syndrome<a id=\"xref-ref-3-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-3\">3</a> to multiple medical disciplines<a id=\"xref-ref-4-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-4\">4</a> including neuroscience,<a id=\"xref-ref-5-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-5\">5</a> obstetrics and gynaecology,<a id=\"xref-ref-6-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-6\">6</a> as well as rehabilitation.<a id=\"xref-ref-7-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-7\">7</a></p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-12\">Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), at the top of the pyramid of the highest strength of clinical evidence,<a id=\"xref-ref-8-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-8\">8</a> are often considered the gold standard for evaluating the efficacy of interventions. However, only adequate reporting of RCTs can provide reliable information and credible conclusions that may aid in policy and medical decision-making. Acupuncture therapies are typically complex during the implementation of RCTs. For an acupuncture RCT, there are many key points needed to be strengthened reporting, which are different from other RCTs, for example, the participants’ compliance, the setting of blinding, the standardisation of acupoint location and the method of needle insertion.<a id=\"xref-ref-9-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-9\">9</a> Despite the increasing number of acupuncture RCTs published in international high-impact journals,<a id=\"xref-ref-10-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-10\">10–13</a> the reporting quality and data-sharing level of these RCTs are not clear.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-13\">To improve transparency and accuracy of the interpretation and replication of RCTs, the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) was first published in 1996,<a id=\"xref-ref-14-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-14\">14</a> updated in 2001<a id=\"xref-ref-15-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-15\">15 16</a> and the latest version was published in 2010,<a id=\"xref-ref-17-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-17\">17 18</a> comprising a checklist, a flow diagram, and an Explanation and Elaboration document. The Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) was drafted in 2001<a id=\"xref-ref-19-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-19\">19</a>and revised in 2010,<a id=\"xref-ref-20-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-20\">20</a> designed as an extension of the CONSORT for acupuncture to increase the reporting for accurate and standardised acupuncture interventions in detail. These two reporting guidelines have the goal of improving research transparency and completeness of reporting, which can help editors and readers fully understand the study process and results.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-14\">In 2004,<a id=\"xref-ref-21-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-21\">21</a> the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) proposed to adopt a trial registration policy requiring investigators to register in a public repository before patient enrolment. Then ICMJE published a proposal<a id=\"xref-ref-22-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-22\">22</a> that clinical trials must contain a data-sharing statement both in the registration and manuscript submission. These proposals establish a favourable environment for clinical trial data disclosure, which can promote evidence dissemination and reusage and avoid research waste.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-15\">The aim of this study is to assess the reporting quality and the data-sharing level of acupuncture RCTs published between 2012 and 2022 by using the CONSORT 2010 checklist and STRICTA, and open science practices, respectively.</p>\n",
       "<h2 class=\"\">Methods</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-16\">This protocol is registered and publicly available via Open Science Framework<a id=\"xref-ref-23-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-23\">23</a> (registration DOI: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/2WTE6\">https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/2WTE6</a>). This cross-sectional study will be written according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology.<a id=\"xref-ref-24-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-24\">24</a> The study is expected to be conducted between 22 November 2022 and 31 December 2024.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Eligibility criteria</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-17\">All published RCTs with two parallel study groups applied to humans that only used acupuncture therapy in the intervention group will be included. The types of the control group include (1) no intervention or waiting list, (2) sham acupuncture or placebo, (3) western medicine, and (4) other interventions such as psychotherapy or rehabilitation and physical therapy guided by modern medical theory. It will also be included if there is a combination with any usual care or conventional therapy in both groups.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-18\">We define the term ‘acupuncture therapy’ as the interventions stimulating specific body areas (called acupoints) by needling, which is based on the traditional Chinese medicine theories, regardless of the difference in instrument size, stimulating spots and needling manipulation, such as body acupuncture, electroacupuncture, auricular acupuncture and acupotomy.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-19\">The following studies will be excluded: (1) if the intervention is acupoint stimulation, and the stimulation does not pierce the skin (such as auricular pressure, acupoint application); (2) the sample size of the study is less than or equal to 10 in each group; (3) authors of the trial are fewer than three; (4) unavailable or no full-text studies (such as conference abstracts, protocols, preprint articles); (5) duplicative articles.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Databases and search strategy</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-20\">A systematic search will be conducted on three English databases (MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica Database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) and four Chinese databases (Chinese Biomedical Literature Service System, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data and VIP Chinese Medical Journal Database) on 15 October 2022. There is no restriction to the language of publication. The time range will be limited from 1 January 2012 to 15 October 2022. The detailed search strategy is shown in <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-1-1\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC1\">online supplemental material 1</a>.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"\">Supplemental material</h3>\n",
       "<h3>Literature screening</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-22\">EndNote (V.X7.1) and Rayyan (<a href=\"https://www.rayyan.ai/\">https://www.rayyan.ai/</a>) will be used to screen the Chinese and non-Chinese literature records, respectively.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-23\">The titles and abstracts of included RCTs will be screened by two researchers (XL and PZ) independently based on eligibility criteria. Then, the full texts will be screened by two researchers (XL and PZ) independently based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Discrepancies will be resolved through discussion or by asking two senior investigators (YD and LY).</p>\n",
       "<h3>Basic characteristics extraction</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-24\">An information extraction table with a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel V.2019 MSO 2210 Build 16.0.15726.20188 32) will be made for data extraction.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-25\">The basic information includes the: (1) title, (2) authors, (3) language, (4) publication (year and the journal), (5) country and region where the research was carried out, (6) study design (superiority, non-inferiority or equivalence), (7) sample size, (8) participants (including age, gender), (9) disease system and detailed disease, (10) types of intervention and controls (dose, frequency and duration), (11) study and follow-up period, (12) outcome measures, (13) adverse event (number, type, severity), (14) the main research purpose, (15) funding (industry, independent or none) (16) conflict of interest and (17) registration information.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-26\">The data will be extracted by two researchers (ZX and PZ) independently, and two senior investigators (YD and LY) may make a decision if there exist any differences.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Assessment and data analysis</h3>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-27\">The overall reporting scores will be analysed using descriptive statistics (mean and 95% CI). The categorical data will be presented as a number (n) and per cent (%).</p>\n",
       "<h4>Pretest</h4>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-28\">Before the formal evaluation, evaluators will be trained and three rounds of pretests will be performed to improve the consistency and accuracy between the investigators. Only when the kappa coefficients &gt;0.75 will we enter the formal evaluation.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-29\">Two researchers will complete the formal evaluation independently (ZX and XL). When disagreement happens, the judgement will be discussed or arbitrated by two senior investigators (YD and LY).</p>\n",
       "<h4>CONSORT statement and STRICTA checklist reporting scores</h4>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-30\">The CONSORT 2010 statement and STRICTA checklist will be used for assessing the reporting quality of included acupuncture RCTs. The specific rules for 37 items of CONSORT scoring will be made according to CONSORT Explanation and Elaboration document. The 17 items of the STRICTA checklist will be scored based on the revised STRICTA. Each item is scored in terms of two possibilities: ‘1’ for ‘reported’ or ‘not applicable’, ‘0’ for ‘insufficiently reported’ or ‘unreported’. Each item score of two checklists for each trial will be summed to provide a total score severally, and the percentage of items reported will be also calculated. The detailed evaluation criteria are shown in <a id=\"xref-supplementary-material-2-1\" class=\"xref-supplementary-material\" href=\"#DC2\">online supplemental material 2</a>.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"\">Supplemental material</h3>\n",
       "<h4>Open science practices</h4>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-32\">The data-sharing level will be assessed by open science practices, including the following items:</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-33\">Whether there is registration information, including registration number, with accessible protocol. Whether there is a completion date in the registration.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-34\">Whether there is a data-sharing statement, and whether the statement fulfils the ICMJE requirements.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-35\">Will individual participant data be available (including data dictionaries)?</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-36\">What data will be shared?</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-37\">What other documents will be available?</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-38\">When will data be available (start and end dates)?</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-39\">Whether there is a contact person for the data.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-40\">For what types of analyses?</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-41\">By what mechanism will data and code/algorithm/software be made available?</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-42\">Whether there is a direct link to the data (such as a data citation).</p>\n",
       "<h2 class=\"\">Discussion</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-43\">Several systematic reviews of the use of CONSORT and STRICTA checklists<a id=\"xref-ref-25-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-25\">25–28</a> have demonstrated an increase in all the items over time since the introduction and influence of the conception of reporting quality. Svenkerud and MacPherson<a id=\"xref-ref-29-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-29\">29</a> revealed that the mean STRICTA score increased from 4.27 in the 1994–1995 period to 5.53 in 2014–2015 with an 18% improvement, while the mean CONSORT score rose from 1.01 to 3.32 with an increment of 46%.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-44\">Previous researchers have evaluated the reporting quality in RCTs concerning various diseases such as cancer<a id=\"xref-ref-30-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30</a> and its complications,<a id=\"xref-ref-31-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-31\">31</a> stroke and post-stroke rehabilitation,<a id=\"xref-ref-32-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-32\">32 33</a> pain,<a id=\"xref-ref-34-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-34\">34 35</a> primary insomnia,<a id=\"xref-ref-36-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-36\">36</a> diabetes,<a id=\"xref-ref-37-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-37\">37</a> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,<a id=\"xref-ref-38-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-38\">38</a> herpes zoster<a id=\"xref-ref-39-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-39\">39</a> and vascular dementia<a id=\"xref-ref-40-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-40\">40</a> among different languages.<a id=\"xref-ref-41-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-41\">41</a> A systematic review by Ma <em>et al</em><a id=\"xref-ref-27-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-27\">27</a> investigated published RCTs between 2004 and 2012 in China and found that the reporting of the sample estimate (1.2%), ethical committee approval (less than 1%) and conflicts of interest (0%) was inadequate. An assessment of 88 papers<a id=\"xref-ref-30-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-30\">30</a> on acupuncture for patients with cancer resulted in a conclusion that the reporting of STRICTA items in present studies was generally good but there were weaknesses related to details of other interventions administered to the acupuncture group and details of the acupuncturists administering treatments. Similarly, another systematic review<a id=\"xref-ref-41-2\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-41\">41</a> of Korean literature drew a conclusion that the completeness of reporting of Korean RCTs of acupuncture was suboptimal, especially the items of sample size calculation (2.9%), allocation concealment (5.8%), ancillary analyses (0.0%) and generalisability of findings (1.9%) in CONSORT as well as the items of setting/context (24.6%) and practitioner background (27.9%) in the STRICTA. Recently, Xiu <em>et al</em><a id=\"xref-ref-28-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-28\">28</a> compared the reporting quality of Chinese and English RCTs and emphasised the urgency of the improvement of Chinese articles.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-45\">Open science can be used to assess the credibility and rigour of the articles by preregistration and transparency for replication of studies.<a id=\"xref-ref-42-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-42\">42</a> Preregistration is thought to reduce publication bias toward significant findings. Replication supports researchers to ensure the programmes do not deviate significantly from the desired plan. Besides, it can enhance knowledge innovation based on previous data and code from others, even to correct mistakes. However, there is limited evidence in this field, which is concentrated in a very small number of diseases such as eating disorders,<a id=\"xref-ref-43-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-43\">43</a> traumatic stress<a id=\"xref-ref-44-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-44\">44</a> and gambling,<a id=\"xref-ref-45-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-45\">45</a> with the findings suggesting a large potential for growth in open science practice usage. To our knowledge, there is no formal study that has explored the data-sharing level of the published acupuncture RCTs to date.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-46\">Hence, our study is the first comprehensive study to evaluate the reporting quality and data sharing on articles comprising acupuncture RCTs across all types of diseases according to the CONSORT 2010 and STRICTA, and the open science practices.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-47\">The principles in the Declaration of Helsinki<a id=\"xref-ref-46-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-46\">46</a> require researchers involving human experimentation to perform ethical responsibility to make their findings publicly available with complete and accurate description. However, the problem of poor research reporting is not unusual and can be subdivided into several types including missing or incomplete information, misleading or selective presentation, obscure language or inconsistent argument with a logical fallacy.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-48\">Among 50% of the research, the reporting was insufficient or incomplete, which is a barrier to the generalisation of strong evidence from research results to support clinical practice.<a id=\"xref-ref-47-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-47\">47</a> Since acupuncture is a practitioner-dependent, experience-required intervention,<a id=\"xref-ref-48-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-48\">48</a> the use of acupuncture in different regions<a id=\"xref-ref-49-1\" class=\"xref-bibr\" href=\"#ref-49\">49</a> can vary from regional characteristics, cultural differences, economic restrictions, value orientations or religions; sufficient details of technical manipulation and study contexts should be delivered to enable readers to understand and replicate the operational processes in other research or practices. Adequate and accurate reporting of acupuncture RCTs can not only guarantee the reliability of both the published study and systematic reviews, or clinical practice guidelines based on them but also improve transparency and reduce the risk of interpretation bias, which is essential to medical decision-making and scientific advancement.</p>\n",

       "'<h2>1 Introduction</h2>\\n<p>Nowadays, the utilization of blockchain technology is in increase day after day [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>]. Person use of blockchain technology has also remarkably increased since 2016. The statistics published by several sources in 2020 show that there were more than 40 million blockchain wallets this year in comparison to 10 million blockchain wallets in 2016. The blockchain is integrated into several areas. Indeed, cryptocurrencies are used in a large way the blockchain technology. The security of cryptocurrencies in blockchain technology is studied giving state-of-art challenges and future prospects in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. Various category is presented in the latter work to show the importance of the blockchain applied to cryptocurrencies.</p>\\n<p>In the face of multiple transactions and a huge number of transactions, good management of these transactions optimize the use of the blocks to reply rapidly to all requested demands. Each transaction is characterized by its estimated execution time. In this paper, we focus on the load balancing of the transactions to the different blocks. The problem addressed in this paper is novel because the work reported has not been proposed or studied anywhere else in the literature. A solution is proposed for a new industrial problem that can be used to balance blocks into blockchain technology.</p>\\n<p>This paper proposes nine algorithms to find the best way to assign the big number of transactions in the given blocks, ensuring fair time execution between blocks. These algorithms are based on the dispatching-rules method, randomization approach, clustering algorithms, and iterative method. The proposed algorithms return approximate solutions in a remarkable time.</p>\\n<p>The choice to use heuristics rather than other methodologies is based on the following advantages provided by heuristic-based algorithms:</p>\\n<p>A comparative study was discussed to measure and show the effectiveness of each developed algorithm compared to the best solutions among all proposed algorithms.</p>\\n<p>The essential contributions of this work are detailed in the following points:</p>\\n<p>The rest of the paper is organized into six sections. A stat of the art is detailed and analysed in Section 2. The second section is reserved for the architecture composed of blocks. In this section, a novel architecture is given and details the different components. A new component called “Balancer” is proposed. The third section defines the problem formulation. All used variables and the modernization of the objective function are detailed in this section. The fourth section presents approximate solutions through different proposed algorithms. Nine algorithms are proposed and illustrated. Section 6 reports the results and discussions. Three classes of instances are tested to compare the performance of the proposed algorithms. Finally, the paper concludes with a summary in Section 7.</p>\\n<h2>2 State of the art</h2>\\n<p>In [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>], the authors give different national and international perspectives regarding the use of cryptocurrencies. The discussion of the cryptocurrency innovations such as Bitcoin is detailed in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. A discussion of the non-trusted blockchain technology called Bitcoin. These authors presented three characterizations of digital money Bitcoin. In [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>] authors give an overview and future perspectives on the utilization of the blockchain in cryptocurrency. In addition, the authors analyze current cryptocurrency projects and give different examples. In this same context authors in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>] studied another literature review regarding the blockchain in cryptocurrency. Blockchain technology is applied in different domains. Indeed, several works treated the application of blockchain technology. In [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>] authors presented a survey of blockchain applications in different domains. Offered contracts that apply or perform fully or partially automatically without human intervention. These contracts are called smart contracts [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. Several works treated blockchain-based smart contracts. Indeed, in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>], the authors extracted 24 papers from several scientific databases to track the smart contract issues and analyses the impact of this utilization. Different smart contract applications are illustrated and future studies are provided. In [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>], the authors analyze 468 research papers that studied the smart contract and their 20,188 references. Six major streams related to the studied research area are identified using factor analysis. Authors in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>] explained the diverse components and working fundamentals of the smart contract. In addition, the authors identified and analyzed the diverse use cases of smart contracts with the interest of utilizing smart contracts in blockchain in several domains. Different algorithms are illustrated related to the use of logic in smart contracts with blockchain systems [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. In healthcare management, several existing in previous research work and applications studied for the healthcare domain using the blockchain approach [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]. Other surveys regarding the contracts with blockchain are studied by several researchers [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]. In [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>], authors explain the combination between the blockchain and the IoT. The authors based the work on the sharing of services and resources and a cryptographically verifiable manner. In fact, this latter work shows that the blockchain-IoT combination can give the new world a new vision regarding real-life manipulation. Another domain that the blockchain technology is applied is financial services. In this context, the blockchain and its effect on financial sectors are treated in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>]. The load balancing is the main core of the studied problem. The load balancing algorithms are largely studied in the literature in different domains in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>].</p>\\n<p>A comprehensive study of the previous research work regarding this issue is presented in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>]. Several works detailed the financial services related with blockchain in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>]. The supply chain with the utilization of the blockchain is also studied in the literature. In [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>], authors show how the boundary conditions must be met before blockchain can be applied. Eighteen boundary conditions were proposed. The shifting trust in the creation of supply chains via blockchain is studied in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>]. A case study of the data management in supply chains using blockchain is presented in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>]. In our work, several algorithms are proposed to solve the load balancing in the blockchain. On the other hand, several works in literature treated the load balancing or as also known as the fair distribution or the equity distribution [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>].</p>\\n<p>Several papers treated the blockchain used different methods that can exploit the proposed algorithms to extend their works [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref046\" class=\"ref-tip\">46</a>].</p>\\n<p>The proposed algorithms can be adopted to solve the parallel machine problem studied in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref047\" class=\"ref-tip\">47</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref052\" class=\"ref-tip\">52</a>].</p>\\n<p>\\n<a href=\"#pone-0286667-t001\">Table 1</a> provides a summary of the related works detailed previously.</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_target\"></p>\\n<p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286667.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286667.t001</a></p>\\n<p>Several other works treating the blockchain problem can be considered [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref046\" class=\"ref-tip\">46</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref053\" class=\"ref-tip\">53</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref054\" class=\"ref-tip\">54</a>].</p>\\n<p>Other scheduling algorithms treated in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref055\" class=\"ref-tip\">55</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref057\" class=\"ref-tip\">57</a>] can be exploited to deal with the studied problem.</p>\\n<p>These previous works give many limitations that can be detailed as follows:</p>\\n<p>To surmount these limitations, this paper proposes nine novel algorithms for efficacy manage the very high number of transactions to the different offered blocks. These algorithms are based on the dispatching-rules method, randomization approach, clustering algorithms, and iterative method. The proposed algorithms return approximate solutions in a remarkable time.</p>\\n<h2>3 Architecture composed of blocks</h2>\\n<p>The studied problem is based on the assignment of the different transactions to different blocks. <a href=\"#pone-0286667-g001\">Fig 1</a> illustrates an overview of this problem. As shown in this latter figure, the component “Balancer” is a novel component that is added to the proposed architecture. This component is responsible to run the proposed algorithms and choose the best one to decide how to assign the given transactions to different blocks. The “Balancer” solve an NP-hard problem. For this reason, the execution time of the algorithm is very crucial and must be considered as one of the metrics to choose the effeminacy of the algorithm.</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_target\"></p>\\n<p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286667.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286667.g001</a></p>\\n<p>The proposed architecture is composed of three components detailed as follows:</p>\\n<p>The transactions component is the engine that is responsible to collect all the given transactions that must be executed. In addition, this component collects also all information on each transaction essentially the estimated running time of each transaction. The second component is the “Balancer”. This is the core of the architecture. Several algorithms are called to solve the problem constituted by the given transactions. Finally, the component “Blocks” is composed of the available blocks.</p>\\n<h2>4 Problem formulation</h2>\\n<p>Let <em>Tr</em> be a set of <em>n</em><sub><em>T</em></sub> transactions to be assigned to <em>n</em><sub><em>b</em></sub> blocks into a blockchain.

Nine algorithms are proposed. The first algorithm is called “Longest Transactions Time” and is denoted by <em>LTT</em>. This algorithm is based on the dispatching rule. The second algorithm is called “Smallest Transactions Time” and is denoted by <em>STT</em>. This algorithm is based on the dispatching rule. A probabilistic algorithm called “Iterative Multi-choice Longest-Transactions Time” and denoted by <em>IML</em> is presented as the third algorithm. The fourth algorithm is called “Iterative Multi-choice Smallest-Transactions Time” and is denoted by <em>IMS</em>. This algorithm is based on the iterative method. The fifth algorithm is called “Block-transaction Iterative Longest-Multi-choice” and is denoted by <em>BIL</em>. This algorithm is based on the probabilistic approach. The “Block-transaction Iterative Smallest-Multi-choice” algorithm is denoted by <em>BIS</em> and constitutes the sixth algorithm. The seventh algorithm is called “Mi-transactions Iterative Longest-Multi-choice” and is denoted by <em>MIL</em>. The “Mi-transactions Iterative Smallest-Multi-choice” algorithm is denoted by <em>MIS</em> and is the eighth one. The last algorithm is called “Best-mi-transactions Iterative Multi-choice” and is denoted by <em>BIM</em>. All algorithms receive as inputs the number of blocks <em>n</em><sub><em>b</em></sub>, the number of transactions <em>n</em><sub><em>T</em></sub>, and the values of the estimated running time <em>rt</em><sub><em>j</em></sub> for each transaction. The proposed algorithms are independent and different from each other.</p>\\n<h3>5.1 Longest Transactions Time (<em>LTT</em>)</h3>\\n<p>This algorithm uses the dispatching rule method by sorting all transactions according to the non-increasing order of their estimated running time. After the sorting, the scheduling will be on the block that has the minimum total workload. The sorting algorithm used for the dispatching rule is the heapsort algorithm. The complexity of this algorithm is <em>O</em>(<em>nlogn</em>) [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref057\" class=\"ref-tip\">57</a>].</p>\\n<h3>5.2 Smallest Transactions Time (<em>STT</em>)</h3>\\n<p>This algorithm is the same as <em>LTT</em>, the difference is to sort all transactions according to the non-increasing order of their estimated running time.</p>\\n<h3>5.3 Iterative Multi-choice Longest-Transactions Time (<em>IML</em>)</h3>\\n<p>The transaction that has the first longest running time and the transaction that has the second longest running time. This is meaning that the choice will be between the two first elements in the table of transactions after sorting. This choice will be based on the application of the probability <em>μ</em>. In fact, for <em>μ</em> probability, the choice is for the transaction that has the first longest running time and for 1 − <em>μ</em> probability for the transaction that has the second longest running time. In the practice, <em>μ</em> = 0.4. The choice will be repeated <em>itn</em> = 800 times and the best solution will be chosen.

However, optimizing the utilization of technological information is very important to save time and money. This paper dealt with the solution to the problem related to the transactions that can be treated in the blocks of the blockchain. This problem is an NP-hard one. This problem can be solved by proposing an approximate solution. It is important to give an approximate solution to the studied problem in polynomial time. Nine algorithms are proposed to solve the studied problem in polynomial time. These algorithms are based on the dispatching-rules method, randomization approach, clustering algorithms, and iterative method. The results show that the best algorithm proposed in this paper is best-mi-transactions iterative multi-choice with 93.9% in an average running time of 0.003 s. The proposed algorithms give several approximate solutions in a remarkable running time. The limitation of this work is the comparison of the best-proposed algorithm to a valid lower bound of the studied problem. Four future axes can be extended for this research. The first axe is to develop an optimal solution to the studied problem. The proposed algorithms can be utilized to obtain the exact solution in a decision tree. The second future axe is to test the proposed algorithms over extended classes of instances and determine some hard classes of instances. The third future axe is to use the proposed algorithms in several meta-heuristics to enhance the solutions.

       "'<h2>1 Introduction</h2>\\n<p>Nowadays, the utilization of blockchain technology is in increase day after day [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>]. Person use of blockchain technology has also remarkably increased since 2016. The statistics published by several sources in 2020 show that there were more than 40 million blockchain wallets this year in comparison to 10 million blockchain wallets in 2016. The blockchain is integrated into several areas. Indeed, cryptocurrencies are used in a large way the blockchain technology. The security of cryptocurrencies in blockchain technology is studied giving state-of-art challenges and future prospects in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>]. Various category is presented in the latter work to show the importance of the blockchain applied to cryptocurrencies.</p>\\n<p>In the face of multiple transactions and a huge number of transactions, good management of these transactions optimize the use of the blocks to reply rapidly to all requested demands. Each transaction is characterized by its estimated execution time. In this paper, we focus on the load balancing of the transactions to the different blocks. The problem addressed in this paper is novel because the work reported has not been proposed or studied anywhere else in the literature. A solution is proposed for a new industrial problem that can be used to balance blocks into blockchain technology.</p>\\n<p>This paper proposes nine algorithms to find the best way to assign the big number of transactions in the given blocks, ensuring fair time execution between blocks. These algorithms are based on the dispatching-rules method, randomization approach, clustering algorithms, and iterative method. The proposed algorithms return approximate solutions in a remarkable time.</p>\\n<p>The choice to use heuristics rather than other methodologies is based on the following advantages provided by heuristic-based algorithms:</p>\\n<p>A comparative study was discussed to measure and show the effectiveness of each developed algorithm compared to the best solutions among all proposed algorithms.</p>\\n<p>The essential contributions of this work are detailed in the following points:</p>\\n<p>The rest of the paper is organized into six sections. A stat of the art is detailed and analysed in Section 2. The second section is reserved for the architecture composed of blocks. In this section, a novel architecture is given and details the different components. A new component called “Balancer” is proposed. The third section defines the problem formulation. All used variables and the modernization of the objective function are detailed in this section. The fourth section presents approximate solutions through different proposed algorithms. Nine algorithms are proposed and illustrated. Section 6 reports the results and discussions. Three classes of instances are tested to compare the performance of the proposed algorithms. Finally, the paper concludes with a summary in Section 7.</p>\\n<h2>2 State of the art</h2>\\n<p>In [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>], the authors give different national and international perspectives regarding the use of cryptocurrencies. The discussion of the cryptocurrency innovations such as Bitcoin is detailed in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>]. A discussion of the non-trusted blockchain technology called Bitcoin. These authors presented three characterizations of digital money Bitcoin. In [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref005\" class=\"ref-tip\">5</a>] authors give an overview and future perspectives on the utilization of the blockchain in cryptocurrency. In addition, the authors analyze current cryptocurrency projects and give different examples. In this same context authors in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>] studied another literature review regarding the blockchain in cryptocurrency. Blockchain technology is applied in different domains. Indeed, several works treated the application of blockchain technology. In [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>] authors presented a survey of blockchain applications in different domains. Offered contracts that apply or perform fully or partially automatically without human intervention. These contracts are called smart contracts [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>]. Several works treated blockchain-based smart contracts. Indeed, in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>], the authors extracted 24 papers from several scientific databases to track the smart contract issues and analyses the impact of this utilization. Different smart contract applications are illustrated and future studies are provided. In [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>], the authors analyze 468 research papers that studied the smart contract and their 20,188 references. Six major streams related to the studied research area are identified using factor analysis. Authors in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>] explained the diverse components and working fundamentals of the smart contract. In addition, the authors identified and analyzed the diverse use cases of smart contracts with the interest of utilizing smart contracts in blockchain in several domains. Different algorithms are illustrated related to the use of logic in smart contracts with blockchain systems [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>]. In healthcare management, several existing in previous research work and applications studied for the healthcare domain using the blockchain approach [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref018\" class=\"ref-tip\">18</a>]. Other surveys regarding the contracts with blockchain are studied by several researchers [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]. In [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>], authors explain the combination between the blockchain and the IoT. The authors based the work on the sharing of services and resources and a cryptographically verifiable manner. In fact, this latter work shows that the blockchain-IoT combination can give the new world a new vision regarding real-life manipulation. Another domain that the blockchain technology is applied is financial services. In this context, the blockchain and its effect on financial sectors are treated in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>]. The load balancing is the main core of the studied problem. The load balancing algorithms are largely studied in the literature in different domains in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>].</p>\\n<p>A comprehensive study of the previous research work regarding this issue is presented in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>]. Several works detailed the financial services related with blockchain in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>]. The supply chain with the utilization of the blockchain is also studied in the literature. In [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref033\" class=\"ref-tip\">33</a>], authors show how the boundary conditions must be met before blockchain can be applied. Eighteen boundary conditions were proposed. The shifting trust in the creation of supply chains via blockchain is studied in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>]. A case study of the data management in supply chains using blockchain is presented in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>]. In our work, several algorithms are proposed to solve the load balancing in the blockchain. On the other hand, several works in literature treated the load balancing or as also known as the fair distribution or the equity distribution [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>].</p>\\n<p>Several papers treated the blockchain used different methods that can exploit the proposed algorithms to extend their works [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref046\" class=\"ref-tip\">46</a>].</p>\\n<p>The proposed algorithms can be adopted to solve the parallel machine problem studied in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref047\" class=\"ref-tip\">47</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref052\" class=\"ref-tip\">52</a>].</p>\\n<p>\\n<a href=\"#pone-0286667-t001\">Table 1</a> provides a summary of the related works detailed previously.</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_target\"></p>\\n<p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286667.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286667.t001</a></p>\\n<p>Several other works treating the blockchain problem can be considered [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref046\" class=\"ref-tip\">46</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref053\" class=\"ref-tip\">53</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref054\" class=\"ref-tip\">54</a>].</p>\\n<p>Other scheduling algorithms treated in [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref055\" class=\"ref-tip\">55</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref057\" class=\"ref-tip\">57</a>] can be exploited to deal with the studied problem.</p>\\n<p>These previous works give many limitations that can be detailed as follows:</p>\\n<p>To surmount these limitations, this paper proposes nine novel algorithms for efficacy manage the very high number of transactions to the different offered blocks. These algorithms are based on the dispatching-rules method, randomization approach, clustering algorithms, and iterative method. The proposed algorithms return approximate solutions in a remarkable time.</p>\\n<h2>3 Architecture composed of blocks</h2>\\n<p>The studied problem is based on the assignment of the different transactions to different blocks. <a href=\"#pone-0286667-g001\">Fig 1</a> illustrates an overview of this problem. As shown in this latter figure, the component “Balancer” is a novel component that is added to the proposed architecture. This component is responsible to run the proposed algorithms and choose the best one to decide how to assign the given transactions to different blocks. The “Balancer” solve an NP-hard problem. For this reason, the execution time of the algorithm is very crucial and must be considered as one of the metrics to choose the effeminacy of the algorithm.</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_target\"></p>\\n<p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286667.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286667.g001</a></p>\\n<p>The proposed architecture is composed of three components detailed as follows:</p>\\n<p>The transactions component is the engine that is responsible to collect all the given transactions that must be executed. In addition, this component collects also all information on each transaction essentially the estimated running time of each transaction. The second component is the “Balancer”. This is the core of the architecture. Several algorithms are called to solve the problem constituted by the given transactions. Finally, the component “Blocks” is composed of the available blocks.</p>\\n<h2>4 Problem formulation</h2>\\n<p>Let <em>Tr</em> be a set of <em>n</em><sub><em>T</em></sub> transactions to be assigned to <em>n</em><sub><em>b</em></sub> blocks into a blockchain.

Nine algorithms are proposed. The first algorithm is called “Longest Transactions Time” and is denoted by <em>LTT</em>. This algorithm is based on the dispatching rule. The second algorithm is called “Smallest Transactions Time” and is denoted by <em>STT</em>. This algorithm is based on the dispatching rule. A probabilistic algorithm called “Iterative Multi-choice Longest-Transactions Time” and denoted by <em>IML</em> is presented as the third algorithm. The fourth algorithm is called “Iterative Multi-choice Smallest-Transactions Time” and is denoted by <em>IMS</em>. This algorithm is based on the iterative method. The fifth algorithm is called “Block-transaction Iterative Longest-Multi-choice” and is denoted by <em>BIL</em>. This algorithm is based on the probabilistic approach. The “Block-transaction Iterative Smallest-Multi-choice” algorithm is denoted by <em>BIS</em> and constitutes the sixth algorithm. The seventh algorithm is called “Mi-transactions Iterative Longest-Multi-choice” and is denoted by <em>MIL</em>. The “Mi-transactions Iterative Smallest-Multi-choice” algorithm is denoted by <em>MIS</em> and is the eighth one. The last algorithm is called “Best-mi-transactions Iterative Multi-choice” and is denoted by <em>BIM</em>. All algorithms receive as inputs the number of blocks <em>n</em><sub><em>b</em></sub>, the number of transactions <em>n</em><sub><em>T</em></sub>, and the values of the estimated running time <em>rt</em><sub><em>j</em></sub> for each transaction. The proposed algorithms are independent and different from each other.</p>\\n<h3>5.1 Longest Transactions Time (<em>LTT</em>)</h3>\\n<p>This algorithm uses the dispatching rule method by sorting all transactions according to the non-increasing order of their estimated running time. After the sorting, the scheduling will be on the block that has the minimum total workload. The sorting algorithm used for the dispatching rule is the heapsort algorithm. The complexity of this algorithm is <em>O</em>(<em>nlogn</em>) [<a href=\"#pone.0286667.ref057\" class=\"ref-tip\">57</a>].</p>\\n<h3>5.2 Smallest Transactions Time (<em>STT</em>)</h3>\\n<p>This algorithm is the same as <em>LTT</em>, the difference is to sort all transactions according to the non-increasing order of their estimated running time.</p>\\n<h3>5.3 Iterative Multi-choice Longest-Transactions Time (<em>IML</em>)</h3>\\n<p>The transaction that has the first longest running time and the transaction that has the second longest running time. This is meaning that the choice will be between the two first elements in the table of transactions after sorting. This choice will be based on the application of the probability <em>μ</em>. In fact, for <em>μ</em> probability, the choice is for the transaction that has the first longest running time and for 1 − <em>μ</em> probability for the transaction that has the second longest running time. In the practice, <em>μ</em> = 0.4. The choice will be repeated <em>itn</em> = 800 times and the best solution will be chosen. The procedure <em>NIO</em>() is responsible for the ordering of the transactions given in input according to the non-increasing order of its running time. The procedure <em>SHE</em>() is responsible for the scheduling of the transactions given in input on the most available block. In addition, <em>Tr</em><sub>1</sub> represents the first transaction that has the longest running time and <em>Tr</em><sub>2</sub> represents the second transaction that has the longest running time. Algorithm 1 represents the algorithm of <em>IML</em>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Algorithm 1</strong> Iterative Multi-choice Longest-Transactions Time Algorithm (<em>IML</em>)</p>\\n<p>1: Call <em>NIO</em>(<em>Tr</em>)</p>\\n<p>2: <strong>for</strong> (<em>h</em> = 1 to <em>itn</em>) <strong>do</strong></p>\\n<p>3: \\u2003<strong>for</strong> (<em>k</em> = 1 to <em>n</em><sub><em>T</em></sub> − 1) <strong>do</strong></p>\\n<p>4: \\u2003\\u2003Determine <em>Tr</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>Tr</em><sub>2</sub></p>\\n<p>5: \\u2003\\u2003<strong>if</strong> (<em>μ</em>) <strong>then</strong></p>\\n<p>6: \\u2003\\u2003\\u2003Call <em>SHE</em>(<em>Tr</em><sub>1</sub>)</p>\\n<p>7: \\u2003\\u2003<strong>else</strong></p>\\n<p>8: \\u2003\\u2003\\u2003<strong>if</strong> (<em>k</em> = <em>n</em><sub><em>T</em></sub> − 1) <strong>then</strong></p>\\n<p>9: \\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003<strong>if</strong> (<em>Tr</em><sub>1</sub> is not scheduled) <strong>then</strong></p>\\n<p>10: \\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003Call <em>SHE</em>(<em>Tr</em><sub>1</sub>)</p>\\n<p>11: \\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003<strong>else</strong></p>\\n<p>12: \\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003Call <em>SHE</em>(<em>Tr</em><sub>2</sub>)</p>\\n<p>13: \\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003<strong>end if</strong></p>\\n<p>14: \\u2003\\u2003\\u2003<strong>end if</strong></p>\\n<p>15: \\u2003\\u2003<strong>end if</strong></p>\\n<p>16: \\u2003<strong>end for</strong></p>\\n<p>17: \\u2003Calculate <em>Gtw</em><sub><em>h</em></sub></p>\\n<p>18: <strong>end for</strong></p>\\n<p>19: Calculate <span class=\"inline-formula\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0286667.e006\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"></span></p>\\n<p>20: Return <em>Gtw</em></p>\\n<h3>5.4 Iterative Multi-choice Smallest-Transactions Time (<em>IMS</em>)</h3>\\n<p>This algorithm is similar to <em>IML</em>. The difference is to sort the transactions in the first step according to the non-decreasing order of its <em>rt</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>.</p>\\n<h3>5.5 Block-transaction Iterative Longest-Multi-choice (<em>BIL</em>)</h3>\\n<p>This algorithm uses the randomization method. The first step is to sort all transactions according to the non-increasing order of its <em>rt</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>. Next, the second step is to schedule the <em>n</em><sub><em>b</em></sub> transactions that have the longest running time to the blocks. The third step is concerning the remaining transactions. The remaining transactions will be scheduled with a probability <em>ϑ</em>. This probability is based on the choice of the transaction. In fact, for <em>ϑ</em> probability, the choice is for the transaction that has the first longest running time and for 1 − <em>ϑ</em> probability for the transaction that has the second longest running time.

However, optimizing the utilization of technological information is very important to save time and money. This paper dealt with the solution to the problem related to the transactions that can be treated in the blocks of the blockchain. This problem is an NP-hard one. This problem can be solved by proposing an approximate solution. It is important to give an approximate solution to the studied problem in polynomial time. Nine algorithms are proposed to solve the studied problem in polynomial time. These algorithms are based on the dispatching-rules method, randomization approach, clustering algorithms, and iterative method. The results show that the best algorithm proposed in this paper is best-mi-transactions iterative multi-choice with 93.9% in an average running time of 0.003 s. The proposed algorithms give several approximate solutions in a remarkable running time. The limitation of this work is the comparison of the best-proposed algorithm to a valid lower bound of the studied problem. Four future axes can be extended for this research. The first axe is to develop an optimal solution to the studied problem. The proposed algorithms can be utilized to obtain the exact solution in a decision tree. The second future axe is to test the proposed algorithms over extended classes of instances and determine some hard classes of instances. The third future axe is to use the proposed algorithms in several meta-heuristics to enhance the solutions. The last future axe is the incorporation of the proposed algorithm in the future to solve other kinds of problems in cloud management or network routing.</p>\\n<h2>References'"

Introduction</h2>\\n<p>Photo catalysis is the hottest field having large applications of nanomaterials as photo catalysts especially in water treatment and hydrogen generation from water splitting [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref001\" class=\"ref-tip\">1</a>]. In green hydrogen production, photo catalysis can be used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, providing a clean and renewable source of energy. The photons from the light excite the electrons in a semiconductor photocatalyst, allowing them and the corresponding formed holes to participate in the reaction. As a result, water molecules are broken down into hydrogen and oxygen. This process is considered green because it does not generate greenhouse gases or other pollutants [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref002\" class=\"ref-tip\">2</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref003\" class=\"ref-tip\">3</a>].</p>\\n<p>In the degradation of organic pollutants, photo catalysis is used to break down organic pollutants in the environment [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref004\" class=\"ref-tip\">4</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref006\" class=\"ref-tip\">6</a>]. This is particularly useful for pollutants that are resistant to conventional treatment methods, such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref007\" class=\"ref-tip\">7</a>]. Among the reported wastewater treatment processes, photo degradation of the organic pollutants is the simplest and cheapest treatment strategy [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref008\" class=\"ref-tip\">8</a>]. In this process, a highly reactive species (e.g. OH radical and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) are formed due to photons absorption by the semiconductor photo catalysts [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref009\" class=\"ref-tip\">9</a>]. Consequently, the photodegradable organic molecules are oxidized and broken down to simple and environmentally safe molecules. This process can be performed both in water and air, making it a versatile tool for environmental remediation [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref010\" class=\"ref-tip\">10</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref011\" class=\"ref-tip\">11</a>]. Moreover, photo degradation can also be brought on by other types of electromagnetic radiation [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref012\" class=\"ref-tip\">12</a>]. Overall, photo catalysis is a promising technology for both producing green hydrogen and mitigating environmental pollution.</p>\\n<p>The surface area of the utilized photo catalyst is a key factor. Accordingly, due to the extremely high surface area, the nanomaterials showed excellent performance. The high surface area allows for a larger number of active sites, which increases the rate of reaction. The increased active sites also increase the probability of collisions between the reactants and the catalyst, leading to improved reaction efficiency. In addition to the high surface area, the nanoscale size of photo catalysts also allows for improved light absorption and increased light penetration, leading to more efficient utilization of light energy. Furthermore, the small size of nanomaterials also enhances the mass transport of reactants to and from the surface, leading to a faster reaction rate.</p>\\n<p>Accordingly, in the field of green hydrogen production from water splitting, several functional nanomaterials offered a distinct performance [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref013\" class=\"ref-tip\">13</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref014\" class=\"ref-tip\">14</a>]. In the same fashion, nanomaterials exhibit an excellent performance as photo catalysts in organic pollutants removal by photo catalysis technique [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref015\" class=\"ref-tip\">15</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref016\" class=\"ref-tip\">16</a>]. Paradoxically, exploiting the nanomaterials photo catalysts still applicable in a lab scale because most of the researchers ignored separation of the used function nanomaterials from the reactions media. Therefore, in wastewater treatment, indeed, the nanomaterials showed an excellent performance as photo catalysts in dye degradation, these nanocatalysts create a secondary pollution.</p>\\n<p>Immobilization of these catalysts can address this issue if an appropriate support and a suitable fixation technique are employed [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref017\" class=\"ref-tip\">17</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref019\" class=\"ref-tip\">19</a>]. This would ensure that the catalyst remains stable throughout its intended use and provide effective results with minimal wastage or loss of material over time [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref020\" class=\"ref-tip\">20</a>]. In addition, catalyst immobilization minimizes costs by enabling reuse, increasing stability, preventing catalyst self-destruction, and controlling the reaction media [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref021\" class=\"ref-tip\">21</a>]. In this regard, different supports for functional photo catalysts have been investigated including hydrogels, carbon nanotubes [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref022\" class=\"ref-tip\">22</a>], polymers [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref023\" class=\"ref-tip\">23</a>], silk fibroin [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref024\" class=\"ref-tip\">24</a>] and other inorganic materials [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref025\" class=\"ref-tip\">25</a>].</p>\\n<p>Silica is a highly sought-after support material due to its impressive thermal and chemical stability, as well as its large surface area. This makes it an ideal support matrix for numerous functional materials, allowing reactants to access the active sites of the catalyst more easily than with other materials. In this regard, this promised support has been utilized for immobilizing several catalysts such as metalloporphyrins [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref026\" class=\"ref-tip\">26</a>], rhodium [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref027\" class=\"ref-tip\">27</a>] and methylaluminoxane [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref028\" class=\"ref-tip\">28</a>].</p>\\n<p>In recent years due to their high efficiency and environmental sustainability, TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs drew the most attention as an effective photocatalyst [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref029\" class=\"ref-tip\">29</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref030\" class=\"ref-tip\">30</a>]. These semiconductor nanoparticles have been widely used as photo catalysts due to several advantages including high photocatalytic activity, non-toxicity and high stability toward heat, chemical reactions, and environmental degradation which making TiO<sub>2</sub> suitable for use in a wide range of applications. Moreover, TiO<sub>2</sub> is a widely available and low-cost material, making it a suitable choice for large-scale environmental cleaning applications [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref031\" class=\"ref-tip\">31</a>]. In addition, this fantastic semiconductor can be modified with various materials to improve its photocatalytic performance and make it suitable for different applications [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref032\" class=\"ref-tip\">32</a>–<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>]. As a result, TiO<sub>2</sub>‒based nanoparticles are the most widely used photo catalysts in wastewater treatment and green hydrogen production that creates an important step towards a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future. However, to our best knowledge, immobilization of this highly important semiconductor has not yet been introduced.</p>\\n<p>In this study, R25 (commercial grade of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs) was successfully immobilized on the surface of silica granules using the high solubility power of the subcritical water[<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>]. Typically, hydrothermal treatment of R25 and silica granules resulted in partial solubility of the semiconductor NPs and deposition on the surface of the proposed support. Calcination of the coated granules was performed to enhance the adhesion forces between the two oxides. The activated silica granules showed good activity as a packed bed for continuous dye removal as well as in wastewater photo splitting for hydrogen production.</p>\\n<h2>2. Experimental part</h2>\\n<h3>2.1 Materials and methods</h3>\\n<p>Specific amounts from TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (R25, Sigma Aldrich, USA) and washed commercial silica granules (average size 1±0.3mm, obtained from local market in Minya, Egypt) were hydrothermally treated in a Teflon-lined hydrothermal reactor (200 ml volume) at different temperatures (140, 150, 170 and 185°C) for 10 h. The reaction time has been selected based on previous studies to ensure maximum reaction yield. For instance, Tai Thien Huynh et al. have reported very good results when the hydrothermal treatment has been done at 8.0 h [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref035\" class=\"ref-tip\">35</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref036\" class=\"ref-tip\">36</a>]. Based on TiO<sub>2</sub>: sand weight ratio, different samples were prepared; 1:5, 1:10 and 1:20. The filtered granules were washed and calcined at 700°C for 2 h holding time. A 5 mm internal diameter and 12 cm height glass tube was filled with the functionalized silica granules and utilized as a packed bed for dye removal (10 ppm) with a flow rate of 3.53 ml/min under 2000 W halogen lamp. 0.5 g of the prepared catalyst was used in hydrogen generation experiment using 100 ml of a scavenger-free domestic wastewater under direct sunlight in September from 11:00 to 14:00. The granules have been separated and reused in a successive run. In these experiments, the wastewater/granules suspension was placed in a well-sealed round-bottom flask with one opening from which a rubber pipe was fixed. Then the rubber pipe was immersed in a water-filled inverted graduated glass tube; the evolved gases were collected over the water surface. The accumulated gas consists mainly of H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> with a molar ratio of 2:1. The number of moles of accumulated hydrogen was calculated by recording the change in the volume above the water level using the following equation:\\n<a name=\"pone.0287424.e001\" id=\"pone.0287424.e001\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.e001\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(1)</span></span>\\nwhere <em>n</em> is the number of moles of H<sub>2</sub> [mmol/g], <em>V</em> is the volume of the gas (mL), and <em>T</em> is the temperature of the solution (K). Then, a linear regression analysis for the collected data between the time and the number of moles of the collected hydrogen was done.</p>\\n<h3>2.2 Characterizations</h3>\\n<p>The characterizations have been performed in the Central lab for Microanalysis and Nanotechnology, Minia University. The surface morphology of the functionalized silica particles was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM JSM-IT200, JEOL, Japan) equipped with EDX analyzer. X-ray diffractometer from Rigaku (XRD, Japan) was utilized to investigate the chemical composition of the modified silica after the calcination process. High resolution optical microscope with DP73 Digital Camera, Olympus LS was used to get 2D and 3D high resolution images. In El-Minya governorate, Egypt, there is a long (135 Km) water drain (MASRAF Al-MOHEET (, receiving around 9000 m<sup>3</sup>/day industrial, municipal and agriculture wastewaters. For water photo splitting process, samples were collected from this water drain and characterized in Sanitation and Drinking Water Company Labs, El-Minya, Egypt. The samples were withdrawn from the drain during August and September from several locations. Characteristics of the used water are summarized in <a href=\"#pone-0287424-t001\">Table 1</a>.</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_target\"></p>\\n<p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.t001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.t001</a></p>\\n<h2>3. Results and discussion</h2>\\n<h3>3.1 Characterization of the produced catalyst</h3>\\n<p>The dissolution of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (NPs) refers to the process of breaking down the solid NPs into smaller particles or ions in a liquid solution. The rate of dissolution is influenced by several factors including surface area, size, and structure of the NPs, as well as the properties of the solvent. It was proved that, during the hydrothermal treatment, TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs can be broken down to H<sub>2</sub>Ti<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.<em>x</em>H<sub>2</sub>O nanocrystals which can be adsorbed at the surface of the used silica granules. In other words, the subcritical water does have the capability to convert the chemical structure of this important semiconductor to be an absorbable species. Later on, during the cooling process H<sub>2</sub>Ti<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.<em>x</em>H<sub>2</sub>O nanocrystals are hydrolyzed to TiO<sub>2</sub> thin layer covering the supporting material through a sequence of transformation series [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref037\" class=\"ref-tip\">37</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref038\" class=\"ref-tip\">38</a>]:\\n<a name=\"pone.0287424.e002\" id=\"pone.0287424.e002\" class=\"link-target\"></a><span class=\"equation\"><img src=\"article/file?type=thumbnail&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.e002\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"inline-graphic\"><span class=\"note\">(2)</span></span></p>\\n<p>Therefore, the preparation process is carried out in different steps which were graphically illustrated in <a href=\"#pone-0287424-g001\">Fig 1</a>. Briefly, due the new properties of the subcritical water, the R25 NPs are breaking down to H<sub>2</sub>Ti<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.<em>x</em>H<sub>2</sub>O nanocrystals which could be adsorbed on the surface of silica granules. Upon cooling, the formed hydrogen titanate is hydrolyzed (<a href=\"#pone.0287424.e002\">Eq 2</a>) into titanium oxide NPs. However, to increase the adhesion force between the adsorbed TiO<sub>2</sub> crystals and the sand granules, calcination process is required.</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_target\"></p>\\n<p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.g001\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.g001</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"#pone-0287424-g002\">Fig 2A</a> displays optical electronic microscope image for the used pristine sand molecules. As shown, the surface is almost clean. <a href=\"#pone-0287424-g002\">Fig 2B</a> represents 3D image for the pristine surface. It is clear that the surface is rough as the image shows bumps and ridges on the surface. This irregular texture provides high surface area for adsorption of function materials. <a href=\"#pone-0287424-g002\">Fig 2C</a> demonstrates SEM image for the used TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles. It can be concluded that the average diameter of this metal oxide particles is about 7±0.3 μm.</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig2.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig2.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p>\\n<p>High resolution electronic optical microscope for the used sand; (A), 3D image of the pristine sand surface; (B) and SEM image of the used titanium oxide particles; (C).</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.g002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.g002</a></p>\\n<p>The electronic microscope images of the produced coated sand granules, prepared at 170°C hydrothermal temperature using TiO<sub>2</sub>:sand ratio of 1:10 and calcined at 700°C, are displayed in <a href=\"#pone-0287424-g003\">Fig 3</a>. As shown in <a href=\"#pone-0287424-g003\">Fig 3A and 3B</a>, the sand surface was decorated by large and small white spots. The high resolution image in <a href=\"#pone-0287424-g003\">Fig 3C</a> concludes that these spots have smooth and cracked-free surfaces. This finding was further supported by the 3D image (<a href=\"#pone-0287424-g003\">Fig 3D</a>), it can be seen that the white spots are thin and tightly stuck with the sand surface. Considering the large particle size of the used titanium oxide particles (<a href=\"#pone-0287424-g002\">Fig 2C</a>), it can be claimed that formation these white spots were achieved due to an extreme deformation of TiO<sub>2</sub> particles. In other words, formation of these continuous thin white spots was a result of adsorption of very small crystals and/or large molecules. Accordingly, it is highly expected that the relatively large used TiO<sub>2</sub> particles were partially dissolved during the hydrothermal treatment process which supports the aforementioned proposed mechanism.</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig3.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig3.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p>\\n<p>High resolution electronic optical microscope image for the prepared TiO<sub>2</sub>-coated sand granules; (A), two magnifications images for the coated granules surface; (B) and (C), and 3D image for the surface; (D).

Numerically, the surface of the modified silica contains titanium, silicon and oxygen with atomic percentage of 19.58, 3.49 and 76.49%, respectively. This finding was expected due to the observed surface of the treated silica granules; <a href=\"#pone-0287424-g003\">Fig 3</a>.</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig4.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig4.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p>\\n<p>EDX spectrum; (A) and the mass and atomic analyses; B.

Sand cannot be considered a single compound. Indeed, quartz (SiO<sub>2</sub>) represents the major constituent (93–95 wt.%), there are several other oxides are incorporated in the natural sand such as iron oxides (FeO, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), aluminum oxide, lime (CaO), soda (Na<sub>2</sub>O), potash (Kro)… etc. [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref039\" class=\"ref-tip\">39</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref040\" class=\"ref-tip\">40</a>]. On the other hand, the used TiO<sub>2</sub> R25 composes of a single constituent; rutile phase titanium oxide. Accordingly, the observed diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 25.45°, 36.24°, 41.27°, 54.35°, 56.65°, 62.23° and 69.12° corresponding to the crystal planes (110), (101), (111), (211), (220), (002) and (301), respectively represent the rutile phase in the investigated samples [JCPDS #21–1276]. It is noteworthy mentioning that most of the diffraction peaks of quartz and rutile are close and almost overlapped. For the hydrothermally treated sample, the highest peak in the pattern at two theta angle of ~ 60.1° corresponding to <em>d</em> spacing of 0.152 nm can be assigned to (211) crystal plane in the quartz (SiO<sub>2</sub>) crystal according to ICDD #46–1045 [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref041\" class=\"ref-tip\">41</a>]. This peak can be considered a fingerprint for the quartz in the sample as there is no a close rutile peak to this peak. Therefore, decreasing the intensity of this peak in the pattern of the sintered samples can be explained as change in the crystal structure of the quartz during the sintering process and/or covering the silica granules by a highly crystalline layer. Practically, the quartz crystal can be subjected to little deformation upon heating, however this deformation does not lead to destroying a high density crystal plane [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref042\" class=\"ref-tip\">42</a>]. Therefore, it can be claimed that the very low decrease in the intensity of this peak, in the patterns representing the sintered samples, is mainly attributed to coating of the sand granules by a highly crystalline layer; TiO<sub>2</sub>. On the other hand, the main peak of rutile phase at 2theat value of 27.4° corresponding to (110) crystal plane and <em>d</em> spacing of 0.325 nm is close to quartz crystal diffraction peak at 26.6° (<em>d</em> = 0.334 and (101) crystal plane) which resulted in merging these two peaks in the obtained patterns. It is clear that the resultant peak of merging these two standard peaks became predominant after the calcination process; <a href=\"#pone-0287424-g005\">Fig 5</a>. This finding reveals that the crystallinity of the deposited TiO<sub>2</sub> layer was enhanced due to applying the thermal treatment process. In details, XRD results further support the aforementioned proposed mechanism. Typically, as it was explained in the proposed mechanism that, during the hydrothermal treatment process, the used TiO<sub>2</sub> particles were dissolute to form H<sub>2</sub>Ti<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> nanocrystals which were adsorbed on the silica surface. Consequently, for the thermally untreated sample, the intensities of the rutile representative peaks were very small. However, after the calcination process, rutile in the sample was the main phase and its peaks even overlaid the quartz peaks. Therefore, it is safe to claim that, during the calcination process, the adsorbed H<sub>2</sub>Ti<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> nanocrystals were thermally decomposed to TiO<sub>2</sub> thin and dense layer attaching the sand surface. Moreover, increasing the calcination temperature from 500 to 700°C led to improve the crystallinity of the deposited layer as can be concluded from increasing the intensity of the rutile peaks.</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_target\"></p>\\n<p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.g005\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.g005</a></p>\\n<p>The band gap energy of a material is a crucial factor that determines its photo catalytic activity. In photo catalysis, a material absorbs light energy to excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, creating electron-hole pairs that can participate in chemical reactions. The energy required to excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band is determined by the band gap energy of the material. A material with a narrow band gap energy absorbs light of lower energy, while a material with a wide band gap energy absorbs light of higher energy [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>].</p>\\n<p>The band gap energy of a material can be determined by different ways. It can be estimated from its UV-Vis absorption spectrum. In the UV-Vis spectrum, the absorption edge corresponds to the energy required to excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref043\" class=\"ref-tip\">43</a>]. Moreover, the band gap energy can be estimated from a plot of photon energy versus absorption coefficient (α) or absorption wavelength (λ) using the Tauc plot method. The Tauc plot is a linear regression analysis of the absorption coefficient (α) as a function of photon energy (hν) in the vicinity of the absorption edge [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref045\" class=\"ref-tip\">45</a>]. Tauc proposed utilizing optical absorption spectra to estimate the band gap energy of amorphous semiconductors[<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref046\" class=\"ref-tip\">46</a>]. Davis and Mott explored his concept further[<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref047\" class=\"ref-tip\">47</a>]. This method has been invoked to estimate the band gap of TiO<sub>2</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub>-SiO<sub>2</sub> as shown in the insets of <a href=\"#pone-0287424-g006\">Fig 6</a> which displays the UV-vis spectra for pristine TiO<sub>2</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub>, and their composite. Numerically, the band energies for the pristine and modified TiO<sub>2</sub> nanofibers are 3.187 and 3.265 eV, respectively. This finding can conclude both formulations are more efficient under UV radiation. This hypothesis might be valid for the pure semiconductor. However, in case of composite semiconductor, the interaction between the constituents’ band gaps can result in generating high photocatalytic activity under visible radiation [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref044\" class=\"ref-tip\">44</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref048\" class=\"ref-tip\">48</a>]. This supposition was experimentally supported as it will be shown in this study.</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig6.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec1.fig6.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p>\\n<p>The insets represent Tauc plots for determination the band gap energies for the pristine TiO<sub>2</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub>-TiO<sub>2</sub> composite.</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.g006\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.g006</a></p>\\n<h3>3.2 Water photo splitting</h3>\\n<p>In a photo splitting reaction, light energy is used to separate water into its constituent parts: hydrogen and oxygen. However, the reaction can produce excess electron holes or electrons that can quickly recombine and reduce the efficiency of the reaction [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref034\" class=\"ref-tip\">34</a>]. Scavengers are substances that are added to the reaction mixture to remove these excess electron holes or electrons and prevent them from recombining [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref049\" class=\"ref-tip\">49</a>]. Moreover, the scavenger can prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and superoxide (O<sup>-2</sup>). Other scavengers can act as electron donors instead of water to neutralize the excess charge and prevent recombination [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref050\" class=\"ref-tip\">50</a>]. Overall, scavengers play a crucial role in ensuring the success and efficiency of water photo splitting reactions. However, from the economical point of view, scavenger-less water photo splitting process is highly preferable as it will save the scavenger cost.</p>\\n<p>Some organic pollutants can be exploited as photo sensitizers for a scavenger-free water photo splitting reaction under visible light [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref045\" class=\"ref-tip\">45</a>]. These pollutants absorb light and generate electron-hole pairs that promote the reduction and oxidation reactions of water. The use of organic pollutants as photo-sensitizers makes the process environmentally friendly, as these pollutants are typically present in wastewater and can be recovered and used instead of being disposed of. The aforementioned hypotheses were proved by investigation the photocatalytic activity of the proposed material toward water splitting using domestic wastewater as it contains several kinds of organic pollutants. Typically, the sewage wastewater can contain saccharides, amino acids, fatty acids, hydroxyacids, aromatic compounds and steroids [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref051\" class=\"ref-tip\">51</a>]. Therefore, the analysis of the utilized sewage wastewater, as indicated in <a href=\"#pone-0287424-t001\">Table 1</a>, reveals high COD and BOD contents. Moreover, there are considerable amount of phosphorous and nitrogen ‒containing compounds. <a href=\"#pone-0287424-g007\">Fig 7</a> shows the hydrogen generation rate, in a scavenger-less wastewater solution, using the hydrothermally treated modified silica granules and after the calcination process under the direct sunlight. The investigated samples were prepared at 170 and 700°C hydrothermal and calcination temperatures, respectively and 1:20 TiO<sub>2</sub>:sand ratio. Moreover, for comparison, the photo catalytic activity of the used TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles and bared silica granules toward water photosplitting was investigated as well. It is noteworthy mentioning that gas analysis indicates that the obtained gas is CO<sub>2</sub>-free which assures that the collected gas was generated from water splitting. As shown in the figure, a hydrogen production rate of 93×10<sup>−3</sup> mmol/s could be achieved from the hydrothermally treated TiO<sub>2</sub>‒deposited sand granules. Applying the calcination process has a negative impact on the photocatalytic activity as can be observed from the figure. Typically, the hydrogen production rate has been decreased to be ~ 75×10<sup>−3</sup> mmol/s. This finding can be attributed releasing of some TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs from the thermally untreated sand granules surface due the weak adhesion forces. 25 mg from TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles was used during checking the photocatalytic activity of the utilized precursor which almost matches the used amount during preparation of the investigated amount from the functionalized sand granules. As shown, the free TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs have the highest photo catalytic activity among the investigated samples; 227×10<sup>−3</sup> mmol/s hydrogen production rate was observed. Finally, the uncovered sand granules have shown trivial photo catalytic activity toward water splitting reaction. Certainly, the surface area of the titanium oxide nanoparticles has decreased due to the proposed fixation strategy, however the influence on the photo catalytic activity was not upsetting. This result might be assigned to the thinness of deposited layer and/or the role of SiO<sub>2</sub> in enhancing the photo catalytic activity of titanium oxide [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref052\" class=\"ref-tip\">52</a>].</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_target\"><a id=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1\" name=\"article1.body1.sec3.sec2.fig1.caption1.p1\" class=\"link-target\"></a></p>\\n<p>For comparison, hydrogen generation rate was investigated using TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs and naked sand granules under similar conditions.</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.g007\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.g007</a></p>\\n<p>The reusability of a photocatalyst is an important factor to consider in practical applications. It refers to the ability of the photocatalyst to maintain its photocatalytic activity after multiple cycles of use [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref053\" class=\"ref-tip\">53</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref054\" class=\"ref-tip\">54</a>]. In the hydrogen production experiments, the photo catalyst granules/domestic wastewater slurry was stirred at at 500 rpm. Therefore, if the adhesion force between the adsorbed TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles and the surface of the sand molecules is low, the TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles will be detached during the mixing process. Indeed, the hydrothermal treatment could be successfully utilized to coat the sand granules by a thin layer from TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, however strong adhesion is not guaranteed. Therefore, the calcination process was carried out to make a sintering between the two oxides. To scientifcially prove this hypothesis, the calcined granules were used in two successive runs; <a href=\"#pone-0287424-g008\">Fig 8</a>. After the first run, the granules were separated, washed and used in the second run. It can be claimed that obtaining almost similar performance in two successive cycles confirms strong stability of the modified silica granules. This conclusion is also supported by the relatively higher photocatalytic activity of the thermally untreated samples (<a href=\"#pone-0287424-g007\">Fig 7</a>) which was explained as release of some attached TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles due to the low adhesion force with the surface of the sand granules.</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_target\"></p>\\n<p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.g008\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.g008</a></p>\\n<p>Influnce of the hydrothermal treatment temperature on the photocatalytic activity toward water splitting reaction was investigated. The proposed TiO<sub>2</sub>-coated sand granules were prepared at different temperatures; 130, 150, 170 and 185°C. The results are displayed in <a href=\"#pone-0287424-g009\">Fig 9</a>. The results indicated that increasing the hydrothermal temperature enhances the photo catalytic activity in the form of increasing the hydrogen production rate. However, the improvement is not high which concludes that the dissolution of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles in the subcritical water can be carried out at relatively low temperature.</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_target\"></p>\\n<p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.g009\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.g009</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"#pone-0287424-t002\">Table 2</a> summarizes the hydrogen production rate for some recently reported photo catalysts using chemicals as scavangers. As shown in the table, the proposed catalyst shows good activity comparatively. Beside, the proposed catalsyst possesses two main advanatages; the catalyst is fixed on the surface of large granules, and organic pollutants were exploited as scavanger.</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_target\"></p>\\n<p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.t002\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.t002</a></p>\\n<p>Based on previous reports, the good photocatalytic activity of the proposed composite can be attributed to the role of silica in remedation of the fast electrons/holes recombination problem [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref064\" class=\"ref-tip\">64</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref065\" class=\"ref-tip\">65</a>]. Silica can act as an electron acceptor, promoting electron transfer from TiO<sub>2</sub> to the SiO<sub>2</sub> surface. The SiO<sub>2</sub> layer on the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface also serves as a barrier that prevents electron-hole recombination, leading to longer charge carrier lifetimes and improved photocatalytic efficiency. For isnatnce, deposition of SiO<sub>2</sub> on TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotube arrays improved the efficiency of hydrogen production from water splitting. The SiO<sub>2</sub> layer was found to improve the charge transfer properties of TiO<sub>2</sub> by reducing the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref066\" class=\"ref-tip\">66</a>]. Moreover, SiO<sub>2</sub> layer on the surface of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes improved the photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methylene blue under visible light irradiation. The SiO<sub>2</sub> layer was found to act as a barrier that prevented electron-hole recombination and improved the charge transfer properties of TiO<sub>2</sub> [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref067\" class=\"ref-tip\">67</a>].</p>\\n<h3>3.3 Continuous mode dye photo degradation</h3>\\n<p>A packed bed dye photodegradation system consists of a packed bed filled with a photocatalytic material that is exposed to light energy. The <em>S</em> curve is a common plot used to describe the continuous adsorption process. It shows the relationship between the breakthrough time and the adsorbate concentration in the effluent stream. At the beginning of the adsorption process, the concentration of the adsorbate in the effluent stream is low, and the adsorbent bed is able to effectively remove the adsorbate. As the adsorption process continues, the concentration of the adsorbate in the effluent stream increases, and eventually reaches a point where the adsorbent bed becomes saturated and is no longer able to effectively remove the adsorbate. This point is known as the breakthrough point. The <em>S</em> curve shows a gradual increase in the effluent concentration of the adsorbate until the breakthrough point is reached, at which point the concentration rapidly increases. The shape of the curve resembles an \"S\", with a gradual increase in the early stages followed by a steep increase as the breakthrough point is reached. <a href=\"#pone-0287424-g010\">Fig 10</a> demonstrates the breakthrough (<em>S</em> shape) curves for methylene blue dye removal using a packed bed from the modified silica prepared at different TiO<sub>2</sub>: sand ratios at a flow rate of 3.53 ml/min. In contrast to the normal adsorption process, theoretically, in the photodegradation removal of dye, the used catalyst is not exhausted with time. Instead, the removal effecinecy is going constantly with time. However, in the packed bed, the dye degrdation products are not removed fastly from the reaction media especially at low stream flow rate. Moreover, some by products might have adsorption affinity on the catalyst surface. Consequently, the photodegrdation efficeincy decreases with time and also give breakthrough plot [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref068\" class=\"ref-tip\">68</a>]. Considering ~ 95% removal effeciency is an acceptable thereshold, it is clear that the exhaustion point, the elapsed time that correspondig to the desired removal percentage, is strongly affected by TiO<sub>2</sub>: Sand weight ratio. In details, as shown in <a href=\"#pone-0287424-g010\">Fig 10</a>, the exhaustion point was 12.3, 17.4 and 21.3 min for the modified sand granules prepared from a mixture having TiO<sub>2</sub>: sand ratio of 1:20, 1:10 and 1:5, respectively. This finding is acceptable as increasing TiO<sub>2</sub> content leads to enlarge the deposited active spots on the sand surface.</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_target\"></p>\\n<p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.g010\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.g010</a></p>\\n<p>Influence of the thermal treatment step was also investigated in case of utilizing the proposed coated sand granules in a continuous dye degradation process. <a href=\"#pone-0287424-g011\">Fig 11</a> demonstrates the breakthrough curves dye removal process using a packed bed from TiO<sub>2</sub> ‒coated sand granules prepared at 170°C using a slurry contains 20% TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs with respect to sand particles before and after calcination at 700°C. It is clear from the results that the exhaustion point increased distinctly which indicates high photo catalytic activity for the sintered silica compared to the thermally untreated ones.</p>\\n<p class=\"caption_target\"></p>\\n<p class=\"caption_object\"><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.g011\">\\n              https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287424.g011</a></p>\\n<p>As aforementioned, when a photon is absorbed by the TiO<sub>2</sub>, it can create an electron-hole pair. The electron can move to the conduction band of the material, while the hole moves to the valence band. However, if the electron and hole recombine before they can participate in a chemical reaction, the energy from the photon will be wasted and the photocatalytic efficiency of the material will be reduced. An effective approach is to modify the surface of the TiO<sub>2</sub> material with co-catalysts or sensitizers. Co-catalysts can help to facilitate the transfer of electrons or holes to the surface of the material, while sensitizers can absorb photons and transfer the excited electron to the TiO<sub>2</sub> material, reducing the recombination rate of the electron-hole pairs [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref045\" class=\"ref-tip\">45</a>, <a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref069\" class=\"ref-tip\">69</a>]. In this regard, SiO<sub>2</sub> showed good activity as a co-catalyst [<a href=\"#pone.0287424.ref069\" class=\"ref-tip\">69</a>]. Therefore, the higher photo catalytic activity of the sintered sample might be attributed to good adhesion of the titanium oxide nanoparticles on the surface of the sand granules which eleminates the interfacial resistances between the two oxides that enhances the role of SiO<sub>2</sub> in remedation of the electrons/holes recombination problem. Finally, it is noteworthy mentioning that the chosen flow rate was selected to be consistent with the cross section area of the used bed. Numerically, the selected flow rate matches around 180 liter/m<sup>2</sup>.min which is considered high flux rate and highly accepted from the industrial point of view. However, it is planned to study the effect of flow rate in a separate study.</p>\\n<h2>4. Conclusions</h2>\\n<p>Hydrothermal treatment of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs/silica granules mixture at high temperature results in deposition the photo catalyst NPs on the surface of the used support. The hydrothermal treatment temperature relatively affects the performance of the proposed catalyst; 170°C is the best value. Calcination is required to enhance the adhesion force. The modified silica can be utilized as a packed bed for continuous removal of the organic pollutants-containing wastewaters. The exhaustion point in the dye removal breakthrough curves strongly increases in case of the sintered sample due to overcoming the electrons/holes recombination problem. Moreover, the introduced activated silica is a good and stable photo catalyst for water splitting from a scavenger-less wastewater medium under visible light.</p>\\n<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>\\n<p>The authors would like to thank the Deanship of Scientific Research, Qasim University, for funding the publication of this paper.</p>\\n<h2>References'"

       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> is the most common pathogen causing neonatal infections, leading to high mortality worldwide. Along with increasing antimicrobial use in neonates, carbapenem-resistant <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> (CRKP) has emerged as a severe challenge for infection control and treatment. However, no comprehensive systematic review is available to describe the global epidemiology of neonatal CRKP infections. We therefore performed a systematic review of available data worldwide and combined a genome-based analysis to address the prevalence, clonal diversity, and carbapenem resistance genes of CRKP causing neonatal infections.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We performed a systematic review of studies reporting population-based neonatal infections caused by CRKP in combination with a genome-based analysis of all publicly available CRKP genomes with neonatal origins. We searched multiple databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane, bioRxiv, and medRxiv) to identify studies that have reported data of neonatal CRKP infections up to June 30, 2022. We included studies addressing the prevalence of CRKP infections and colonization in neonates but excluded studies lacking the numbers of neonates, the geographical location, or independent data on <em>Klebsiella</em> or CRKP isolates. We used narrative synthesis for pooling data with JMP statistical software. We identified 8,558 articles and excluding those that did not meet inclusion criteria. We included 128 studies, none of which were preprints, comprising 127,583 neonates in 30 countries including 21 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) for analysis. We found that bloodstream infection is the most common infection type in reported data. We estimated that the pooled global prevalence of CRKP infections in hospitalized neonates was 0.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2% to 0.3%). Based on 21 studies reporting patient outcomes, we found that the pooled mortality of neonatal CRKP infections was 22.9% (95% CI, 13.0% to 32.9%). A total of 535 neonatal CRKP genomes were identified from GenBank including Sequence Read Archive, of which 204 were not linked to any publications. We incorporated the 204 genomes with a literature review for understanding the species distribution, clonal diversity, and carbapenemase types. We identified 146 sequence types (STs) for neonatal CRKP strains and found that ST17, ST11, and ST15 were the 3 most common lineages. In particular, ST17 CRKP has been seen in neonates in 8 countries across 4 continents. The vast majority (75.3%) of the 1,592 neonatal CRKP strains available for analyzing carbapenemase have genes encoding metallo-β-lactamases and NDM (New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase) appeared to be the most common carbapenemase (64.3%). The main limitation of this study is the absence or scarcity of data from North America, South America, and Oceania.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>CRKP contributes to a considerable number of neonatal infections and leads to significant neonatal mortality. Neonatal CRKP strains are highly diverse, while ST17 is globally prevalent and merits early detection for treatment and prevention. The dominance of <em>bla</em><sub>NDM</sub> carbapenemase genes imposes challenges on therapeutic options in neonates and supports the continued inhibitor-related drug discovery.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Reducing antibiotic treatment duration is a key component of hospital antibiotic stewardship interventions. However, its effectiveness in reducing antimicrobial resistance is uncertain and a clear theoretical rationale for the approach is lacking. In this study, we sought to gain a mechanistic understanding of the relation between antibiotic treatment duration and the prevalence of colonisation with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospitalised patients.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We constructed 3 stochastic mechanistic models that considered both between- and within-host dynamics of susceptible and resistant gram-negative bacteria, to identify circumstances under which shortening antibiotic duration would lead to reduced resistance carriage. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis of antibiotic treatment duration trials, which monitored resistant gram-negative bacteria carriage as an outcome. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for randomised controlled trials published from 1 January 2000 to 4 October 2022, which allocated participants to varying durations of systemic antibiotic treatments. Quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials. The meta-analysis was performed using logistic regression. Duration of antibiotic treatment and time from administration of antibiotics to surveillance culture were included as independent variables. Both the mathematical modelling and meta-analysis suggested modest reductions in resistance carriage could be achieved by reducing antibiotic treatment duration. The models showed that shortening duration is most effective at reducing resistance carriage in high compared to low transmission settings. For treated individuals, shortening duration is most effective when resistant bacteria grow rapidly under antibiotic selection pressure and decline rapidly when stopping treatment. Importantly, under circumstances whereby administered antibiotics can suppress colonising bacteria, shortening antibiotic treatment may increase the carriage of a particular resistance phenotype. We identified 206 randomised trials, which investigated antibiotic duration. Of these, 5 reported resistant gram-negative bacteria carriage as an outcome and were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis determined that a single additional antibiotic treatment day is associated with a 7% absolute increase in risk of resistance carriage (80% credible interval 3% to 11%). Interpretation of these estimates is limited by the low number of antibiotic duration trials that monitored carriage of resistant gram-negative bacteria, as an outcome, contributing to a large credible interval.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>In this study, we found both theoretical and empirical evidence that reducing antibiotic treatment duration can reduce resistance carriage, though the mechanistic models also highlighted circumstances under which reducing treatment duration can, perversely, increase resistance. Future antibiotic duration trials should monitor antibiotic-resistant bacteria colonisation as an outcome to better inform antibiotic stewardship policies.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Single-centre studies suggest that successive Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related “lockdown” restrictions in England may have led to significant changes in the characteristics of major trauma patients. There is also evidence from other countries that diversion of intensive care capacity and other healthcare resources to treating patients with COVID-19 may have impacted on outcomes for major trauma patients. We aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number, characteristics, care pathways, and outcomes of major trauma patients presenting to hospitals in England.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We completed an observational cohort study and interrupted time series analysis including all patients eligible for inclusion in England in the national clinical audit for major trauma presenting between 1 January 2017 and 31 of August 2021 (354,202 patients). Demographic characteristics (age, sex, physiology, and injury severity) and clinical pathways of major trauma patients in the first lockdown (17,510 patients) and second lockdown (38,262 patients) were compared to pre-COVID-19 periods in 2018 to 2019 (comparator period 1: 22,243 patients; comparator period 2: 18,099 patients). Discontinuities in trends for weekly estimated excess survival rate were estimated when lockdown measures were introduced using segmented linear regression.</p>\n",
       "<p>The first lockdown had a larger associated reduction in numbers of major trauma patients (−4,733 (21%)) compared to the pre-COVID period than the second lockdown (−2,754 (6.7%)). The largest reductions observed were in numbers of people injured in road traffic collisions excepting cyclists where numbers increased. During the second lockdown, there were increases in the numbers of people injured aged 65 and over (665 (3%)) and 85 and over (828 (9.3%)).</p>\n",
       "<p>In the second week of March 2020, there was a reduction in level of major trauma excess survival rate (−1.71%; 95% CI: −2.76% to −0.66%) associated with the first lockdown. This was followed by a weekly trend of improving survival until the lifting of restrictions in July 2020 (0.25; 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.35). Limitations include eligibility criteria for inclusion to the audit and COVID status of patients not being recorded.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>This national evaluation of the impact of COVID on major trauma presentations to English hospitals has observed important public health findings: The large reduction in overall numbers injured has been primarily driven by reductions in road traffic collisions, while numbers of older people injured at home increased over the second lockdown. Future research is needed to better understand the initial reduction in likelihood of survival after major trauma observed with the implementation of the first lockdown.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Migraine carries risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. The risk of premature MI (i.e., among young adults) and stroke differs between men and women; previous studies indicate that migraine is mainly associated with an increased risk of stroke among young women. The aim of this study was to examine impact of migraine on the risk of premature (age ≤60 years) MI and ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke among men and women.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>Using Danish medical registries, we conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study (1996 to 2018). Redeemed prescriptions for migraine-specific medication were used to identify women with migraine (<em>n =</em> 179,680) and men with migraine (<em>n</em> = 40,757). These individuals were matched on sex, index year, and birth year 1:5 with a random sample of the general population who did not use migraine-specific medication. All individuals were required to be between 18 and 60 years old. Median age was 41.5 years for women and 40.3 years for men.</p>\n",
       "<p>The main outcome measures to assess impact of migraine were absolute risk differences (RDs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of premature MI, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke, comparing individuals with migraine to migraine-free individuals of the same sex. HRs were adjusted for age, index year, and comorbidities. The RD of premature MI for those with migraine versus no migraine was 0.3% (95% CI [0.2%, 0.4%]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) for women and 0.3% (95% CI [−0.1%, 0.6%]; <em>p</em> = 0.061) for men. The adjusted HR was 1.22 (95% CI [1.14, 1.31]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) for women and 1.07 (95% CI [0.97, 1.17]; <em>p</em> = 0.164) for men. The RD of premature ischemic stroke for migraine versus no migraine was 0.3% (95% CI [0.2%, 0.4%]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) for women and 0.5% (95% CI [0.1%, 0.8%]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) for men. The adjusted HR was 1.21 (95% CI [1.13, 1.30]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) for women and 1.23 (95% CI [1.10, 1.38]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) for men. The RD of premature hemorrhagic stroke for migraine versus no migraine was 0.1% (95% CI [0.0%, 0.2%]; <em>p</em> = 0.011) for women and −0.1% (95% CI [−0.3%, 0.0%]; <em>p</em> = 0.176) for men. The adjusted HR was 1.13 (95% CI [1.02, 1.24]; <em>p</em> = 0.014) for women and 0.85 (95% CI [0.69, 1.05]; <em>p</em> = 0.131) for men.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Hospital-associated infections (HAIs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality around the world. Many HAIs are caused by drug-resistant bacterial pathogens, but there are major gaps in our understanding of the number of hospital-associated drug-resistant infections (HARIs) worldwide. As such, we estimated trends in prevalence of HARIs caused by high priority pathogens (<em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Acinetobacter</em> spp., <em>Klebsiella</em> spp., <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Enterobacter</em> spp., and <em>Pseudomonas</em> spp.) in 195 countries.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>Resistance prevalence estimates were extracted from 474-point prevalence surveys (PPS) from 99 countries published between 2010 and 2020 coupled with country-level estimates of hospitalization rates and length of stay. Prevalence estimates were transformed in yearly incidence of HARIs per year by country and income group. We estimate the global number of HARIs per year to be 136 million (95% credible interval (CI) 26 to 246 million) per year, with the highest burden in China (52 million, 95% CI 10 to 95 million), Pakistan (10 million, 95% CI 2 to 18 million), and India (9 million, 95% CI 3 to 15 million). Among income groups, middle-income countries bore the highest burden of HARIs per year (119 million, 95% CI 23 to 215 million). Our analysis was constrained by the limited number of PPS for HARIs, lack of community-associated data on antibiotic-resistant infections, and our population level analysis.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>In this study, we observe, in the absence of systematic surveillance systems for HARIs, a baseline overview of their rates. Our yearly estimates highlight the global threat of HARIs and may help define strategies to tackle resistance in hospital settings.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We conducted an open-label trial among adults with TB symptoms at initial HIV diagnosis at GHESKIO in Haiti; participants were recruited and randomized on the same day. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to same-day treatment (same-day TB testing with same-day TB treatment if TB diagnosed; same-day ART if TB not diagnosed) versus standard care (initiating TB treatment within 7 days and delaying ART to day 7 if TB not diagnosed). In both groups, ART was initiated 2 weeks after TB treatment. The primary outcome was retention in care with 48-week HIV-1 RNA &lt;200 copies/mL, with intention to treat (ITT) analysis. From November 6, 2017 to January 16, 2020, 500 participants were randomized (250/group); the final study visit occurred on March 1, 2021. Baseline TB was diagnosed in 40 (16.0%) in the standard and 48 (19.2%) in the same-day group; all initiated TB treatment. In the standard group, 245 (98.0%) initiated ART at median of 9 days; 6 (2.4%) died, 15 (6.0%) missed the 48-week visit, and 229 (91.6%) attended the 48-week visit. Among all who were randomized, 220 (88.0%) received 48-week HIV-1 RNA testing; 168 had &lt;200 copies/mL (among randomized: 67.2%; among tested: 76.4%). In the same-day group, 249 (99.6%) initiated ART at median of 0 days; 9 (3.6%) died, 23 (9.2%) missed the 48-week visit, and 218 (87.2%) attended the 48-week visit. Among all who were randomized, 211 (84.4%) received 48-week HIV-1 RNA; 152 had &lt;200 copies/mL (among randomized: 60.8%; among tested: 72.0%). There was no difference between groups in the primary outcome (60.8% versus 67.2%; risk difference: −0.06; 95% CI [−0.15, 0.02]; <em>p</em> = 0.14). Two new grade 3 or 4 events were reported per group; none were judged to be related to the intervention. The main limitation of this study is that it was conducted at a single urban clinic, and the generalizability to other settings is uncertain.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>There is limited data on antibiotic treatment in hospitalized neonates in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We aimed to describe patterns of antibiotic use, pathogens, and clinical outcomes, and to develop a severity score predicting mortality in neonatal sepsis to inform future clinical trial design.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>Hospitalized infants &lt;60 days with clinical sepsis were enrolled during 2018 to 2020 by 19 sites in 11 countries (mainly Asia and Africa). Prospective daily observational data was collected on clinical signs, supportive care, antibiotic treatment, microbiology, and 28-day mortality. Two prediction models were developed for (1) 28-day mortality from baseline variables (baseline NeoSep Severity Score); and (2) daily risk of death on IV antibiotics from daily updated assessments (NeoSep Recovery Score). Multivariable Cox regression models included a randomly selected 85% of infants, with 15% for validation.</p>\n",
       "<p>A total of 3,204 infants were enrolled, with median birth weight of 2,500 g (IQR 1,400 to 3,000) and postnatal age of 5 days (IQR 1 to 15). 206 different empiric antibiotic combinations were started in 3,141 infants, which were structured into 5 groups based on the World Health Organization (WHO) AWaRe classification. Approximately 25.9% (<em>n</em> = 814) of infants started WHO first line regimens (Group 1—Access) and 13.8% (<em>n</em> = 432) started WHO second-line cephalosporins (cefotaxime/ceftriaxone) (Group 2—“Low” Watch). The largest group (34.0%, <em>n</em> = 1,068) started a regimen providing partial extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)/pseudomonal coverage (piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, or fluoroquinolone-based) (Group 3—“Medium” Watch), 18.0% (<em>n</em> = 566) started a carbapenem (Group 4—“High” Watch), and 1.8% (<em>n</em> = 57) a Reserve antibiotic (Group 5, largely colistin-based), and 728/2,880 (25.3%) of initial regimens in Groups 1 to 4 were escalated, mainly to carbapenems, usually for clinical deterioration (<em>n</em> = 480; 65.9%).</p>\n",
       "<p>A total of 564/3,195 infants (17.7%) were blood culture pathogen positive, of whom 62.9% (<em>n</em> = 355) had a gram-negative organism, predominantly <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> (<em>n</em> = 132) or <em>Acinetobacter</em> spp. (<em>n</em> = 72). Both were commonly resistant to WHO-recommended regimens and to carbapenems in 43 (32.6%) and 50 (71.4%) of cases, respectively. MRSA accounted for 33 (61.1%) of 54 <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> isolates.</p>\n",
       "<p>Overall, 350/3,204 infants died (11.3%; 95% CI 10.2% to 12.5%), 17.7% if blood cultures were positive for pathogens (95% CI 14.7% to 21.1%, <em>n</em> = 99/564). A baseline NeoSep Severity Score had a C-index of 0.76 (0.69 to 0.82) in the validation sample, with mortality of 1.6% (3/189; 95% CI: 0.5% to 4.6%), 11.0% (27/245; 7.7% to 15.6%), and 27.3% (12/44; 16.3% to 41.8%) in low (score 0 to 4), medium (5 to 8), and high (9 to 16) risk groups, respectively, with similar performance across subgroups. A related NeoSep Recovery Score had an area under the receiver operating curve for predicting death the next day between 0.8 and 0.9 over the first week. There was significant variation in outcomes between sites and external validation would strengthen score applicability.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n",
       "<p>Antibiotic regimens used in neonatal sepsis commonly diverge from WHO guidelines, and trials of novel empiric regimens are urgently needed in the context of increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The baseline NeoSep Severity Score identifies high mortality risk criteria for trial entry, while the NeoSep Recovery Score can help guide decisions on regimen change. NeoOBS data informed the NeoSep1 antibiotic trial (ISRCTN48721236), which aims to identify novel first- and second-line empiric antibiotic regimens for neonatal sepsis.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>An increased risk of myocarditis or pericarditis after priming with mRNA Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines has been shown but information on the risk post-booster is limited. With the now high prevalence of prior Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we assessed the effect of prior infection on the vaccine risk and the risk from COVID-19 reinfection.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We conducted a self-controlled case series analysis of hospital admissions for myocarditis or pericarditis in England between 22 February 2021 and 6 February 2022 in the 50 million individuals eligible to receive the adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1-S) for priming or an mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) for priming or boosting. Myocarditis and pericarditis admissions were extracted from the Secondary Uses Service (SUS) database in England and vaccination histories from the National Immunisation Management System (NIMS); prior infections were obtained from the UK Health Security Agency’s Second-Generation Surveillance Systems. The relative incidence (RI) of admission within 0 to 6 and 7 to 14 days of vaccination compared with periods outside these risk windows stratified by age, dose, and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection for individuals aged 12 to 101 years was estimated. The RI within 27 days of an infection was assessed in the same model. There were 2,284 admissions for myocarditis and 1,651 for pericarditis in the study period. Elevated RIs were only observed in 16- to 39-year-olds 0 to 6 days postvaccination, mainly in males for myocarditis. Both mRNA vaccines showed elevated RIs after first, second, and third doses with the highest RIs after a second dose 5.34 (95% confidence interval (CI) [3.81, 7.48]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) for BNT162b2 and 56.48 (95% CI [33.95, 93.97]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) for mRNA-1273 compared with 4.38 (95% CI [2.59, 7.38]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) and 7.88 (95% CI [4.02, 15.44]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001), respectively, after a third dose. For ChAdOx1-S, an elevated RI was only observed after a first dose, RI 5.23 (95% CI [2.48, 11.01]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). An elevated risk of admission for pericarditis was only observed 0 to 6 days after a second dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine in 16 to 39 year olds, RI 4.84 (95% CI [1.62, 14.01]; <em>p</em> = 0.004). RIs were lower in those with a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection than in those without, 2.47 (95% CI [1.32,4.63]; <em>p</em> = 0.005) versus 4.45 (95% [3.12, 6.34]; <em>p</em> = 0.001) after a second BNT162b2 dose, and 19.07 (95% CI [8.62, 42.19]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) versus 37.2 (95% CI [22.18, 62.38]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) for mRNA-1273 (myocarditis and pericarditis outcomes combined). RIs 1 to 27 days postinfection were elevated in all ages and were marginally lower for breakthrough infections, 2.33 (95% CI [1.96, 2.76]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) compared with 3.32 (95% CI [2.54, 4.33]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) in vaccine-naïve individuals respectively.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>We observed an increased risk of myocarditis within the first week after priming and booster doses of mRNA vaccines, predominantly in males under 40 years with the highest risks after a second dose. The risk difference between the second and the third doses was particularly marked for the mRNA-1273 vaccine that contains half the amount of mRNA when used for boosting than priming. The lower risk in those with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, and lack of an enhanced effect post-booster, does not suggest a spike-directed immune mechanism. Research to understand the mechanism of vaccine-associated myocarditis and to document the risk with bivalent mRNA vaccines is warranted.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Antibiotic resistance is a global public health issue, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where antibiotics required to treat resistant infections are not affordable. LMICs also bear a disproportionately high burden of bacterial diseases, particularly among children, and resistance jeopardizes progress made in these areas. Although outpatient antibiotic use is a major driver of antibiotic resistance, data on inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in LMICs are scarce at the community level, where the majority of prescribing occurs. Here, we aimed to characterize inappropriate antibiotic prescribing among young outpatient children and to identify its determinants in 3 LMICs.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We used data from a prospective, community-based mother-and-child cohort (BIRDY, 2012 to 2018) conducted across urban and rural sites in Madagascar, Senegal, and Cambodia. Children were included at birth and followed-up for 3 to 24 months. Data from all outpatient consultations and antibiotics prescriptions were recorded. We defined inappropriate prescriptions as antibiotics prescribed for a health event determined not to require antibiotic therapy (antibiotic duration, dosage, and formulation were not considered). Antibiotic appropriateness was determined a posteriori using a classification algorithm developed according to international clinical guidelines. We used mixed logistic analyses to investigate risk factors for antibiotic prescription during consultations in which children were determined not to require antibiotics. Among the 2,719 children included in this analysis, there were 11,762 outpatient consultations over the follow-up period, of which 3,448 resulted in antibiotic prescription. Overall, 76.5% of consultations resulting in antibiotic prescription were determined not to require antibiotics, ranging from 71.5% in Madagascar to 83.3% in Cambodia. Among the 10,416 consultations (88.6%) determined not to require antibiotic therapy, 25.3% (<em>n</em> = 2,639) nonetheless resulted in antibiotic prescription. This proportion was much lower in Madagascar (15.6%) than in Cambodia (57.0%) or Senegal (57.2%) (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). Among the consultations determined not to require antibiotics, in both Cambodia and Madagascar the diagnoses accounting for the greatest absolute share of inappropriate prescribing were rhinopharyngitis (59.0% of associated consultations in Cambodia, 7.9% in Madagascar) and gastroenteritis without evidence of blood in the stool (61.6% and 24.6%, respectively). In Senegal, uncomplicated bronchiolitis accounted for the greatest number of inappropriate prescriptions (84.4% of associated consultations). Across all inappropriate prescriptions, the most frequently prescribed antibiotic was amoxicillin in Cambodia and Madagascar (42.1% and 29.2%, respectively) and cefixime in Senegal (31.2%). Covariates associated with an increased risk of inappropriate prescription include patient age greater than 3 months (adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) ranged across countries from 1.91 [1.63, 2.25] to 5.25 [3.85, 7.15], <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) and living in rural as opposed to urban settings (aOR ranged across countries from 1.83 [1.57, 2.14] to 4.40 [2.34, 8.28], <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). Diagnosis with a higher severity score was also associated with an increased risk of inappropriate prescription (aOR = 2.00 [1.75, 2.30] for moderately severe, 3.10 [2.47, 3.91] for most severe, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001), as was consultation during the rainy season (aOR = 1.32 [1.19, 1.47], <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). The main limitation of our study is the lack of bacteriological documentation, which may have resulted in some diagnosis misclassification and possible overestimation of inappropriate antibiotic prescription.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n",
       "<p>In this study, we observed extensive inappropriate antibiotic prescribing among pediatric outpatients in Madagascar, Senegal, and Cambodia. Despite great intercountry heterogeneity in prescribing practices, we identified common risk factors for inappropriate prescription. This underscores the importance of implementing local programs to optimize antibiotic prescribing at the community level in LMICs.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>People with comorbidities are underrepresented in clinical trials. Empirical estimates of treatment effect modification by comorbidity are lacking, leading to uncertainty in treatment recommendations. We aimed to produce estimates of treatment effect modification by comorbidity using individual participant data (IPD).</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We obtained IPD for 120 industry-sponsored phase 3/4 trials across 22 index conditions (<em>n</em> = 128,331). Trials had to be registered between 1990 and 2017 and have recruited ≥300 people. Included trials were multicentre and international. For each index condition, we analysed the outcome most frequently reported in the included trials. We performed a two-stage IPD meta-analysis to estimate modification of treatment effect by comorbidity. First, for each trial, we modelled the interaction between comorbidity and treatment arm adjusted for age and sex. Second, for each treatment within each index condition, we meta-analysed the comorbidity–treatment interaction terms from each trial. We estimated the effect of comorbidity measured in 3 ways: (i) the number of comorbidities (in addition to the index condition); (ii) presence or absence of the 6 commonest comorbid diseases for each index condition; and (iii) using continuous markers of underlying conditions (e.g., estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)). Treatment effects were modelled on the usual scale for the type of outcome (absolute scale for numerical outcomes, relative scale for binary outcomes). Mean age in the trials ranged from 37.1 (allergic rhinitis trials) to 73.0 (dementia trials) and percentage of male participants range from 4.4% (osteoporosis trials) to 100% (benign prostatic hypertrophy trials). The percentage of participants with 3 or more comorbidities ranged from 2.3% (allergic rhinitis trials) to 57% (systemic lupus erythematosus trials). We found no evidence of modification of treatment efficacy by comorbidity, for any of the 3 measures of comorbidity. This was the case for 20 conditions for which the outcome variable was continuous (e.g., change in glycosylated haemoglobin in diabetes) and for 3 conditions in which the outcomes were discrete events (e.g., number of headaches in migraine). Although all were null, estimates of treatment effect modification were more precise in some cases (e.g., sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors for type 2 diabetes—interaction term for comorbidity count 0.004, 95% CI −0.01 to 0.02) while for others credible intervals were wide (e.g., corticosteroids for asthma—interaction term −0.22, 95% CI −1.07 to 0.54). The main limitation is that these trials were not designed or powered to assess variation in treatment effect by comorbidity, and relatively few trial participants had &gt;3 comorbidities.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>Assessments of treatment effect modification rarely consider comorbidity. Our findings demonstrate that for trials included in this analysis, there was no empirical evidence of treatment effect modification by comorbidity. The standard assumption used in evidence syntheses is that efficacy is constant across subgroups, although this is often criticised. Our findings suggest that for modest levels of comorbidities, this assumption is reasonable. Thus, trial efficacy findings can be combined with data on natural history and competing risks to assess the likely overall benefit of treatments in the context of comorbidity.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Circulation of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRB) in healthcare facilities is a major public health problem. These settings have been greatly impacted by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, notably due to surges in COVID-19 caseloads and the implementation of infection control measures. We sought to evaluate how such collateral impacts of COVID-19 impacted the nosocomial spread of MRB in an early pandemic context.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We developed a mathematical model in which Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and MRB cocirculate among patients and staff in a theoretical hospital population. Responses to COVID-19 were captured mechanistically via a range of parameters that reflect impacts of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on factors relevant for pathogen transmission. COVID-19 responses include both “policy responses” willingly enacted to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission (e.g., universal masking, patient lockdown, and reinforced hand hygiene) and “caseload responses” unwillingly resulting from surges in COVID-19 caseloads (e.g., abandonment of antibiotic stewardship, disorganization of infection control programmes, and extended length of stay for COVID-19 patients). We conducted 2 main sets of model simulations, in which we quantified impacts of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on MRB colonization incidence and antibiotic resistance rates (the share of colonization due to antibiotic-resistant versus antibiotic-sensitive strains).</p>\n",
       "<p>The first set of simulations represents diverse MRB and nosocomial environments, accounting for high levels of heterogeneity across bacterial parameters (e.g., rates of transmission, antibiotic sensitivity, and colonization prevalence among newly admitted patients) and hospital parameters (e.g., rates of interindividual contact, antibiotic exposure, and patient admission/discharge). On average, COVID-19 control policies coincided with MRB prevention, including 28.2% [95% uncertainty interval: 2.5%, 60.2%] fewer incident cases of patient MRB colonization. Conversely, surges in COVID-19 caseloads favoured MRB transmission, resulting in a 13.8% [−3.5%, 77.0%] increase in colonization incidence and a 10.4% [0.2%, 46.9%] increase in antibiotic resistance rates in the absence of concomitant COVID-19 control policies. When COVID-19 policy responses and caseload responses were combined, MRB colonization incidence decreased by 24.2% [−7.8%, 59.3%], while resistance rates increased by 2.9% [−5.4%, 23.2%]. Impacts of COVID-19 responses varied across patients and staff and their respective routes of pathogen acquisition.</p>\n",
       "<p>The second set of simulations was tailored to specific hospital wards and nosocomial bacteria (methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing <em>Escherichia coli</em>). Consequences of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks were found to be highly context specific, with impacts depending on the specific ward and bacteria evaluated. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks significantly impacted patient MRB colonization only in settings with high underlying risk of bacterial transmission. Yet across settings and species, antibiotic resistance burden was reduced in facilities with timelier implementation of effective COVID-19 control policies.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>Our model suggests that surges in nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission generate selection for the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Timely implementation of efficient COVID-19 control measures thus has 2-fold benefits, preventing the transmission of both SARS-CoV-2 and MRB, and highlighting antibiotic resistance control as a collateral benefit of pandemic preparedness.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Despite possible benefits for growth, milk is costly to include in foods for undernourished children. Furthermore, the relative effects of different milk components, milk protein (MP), and whey permeate (WP) are unclear. We aimed to assess the effects of MP and WP in lipid-based nutrient supplement (LNS), and of LNS itself, on linear growth and body composition among stunted children.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We performed a randomized, double-blind, 2 × 2 factorial trial among 12 to 59 months old stunted children in Uganda. Children were randomized to 4 formulations of LNS with MP or soy protein isolate and WP or maltodextrin (100 g/day for 12 weeks) or no supplementation. Investigators and outcome assessors were blinded; however, participants were only blinded to the ingredients in LNS. Data were analyzed based on intention-to-treat (ITT) using linear mixed-effects models adjusted for age, sex, season, and site. Primary outcomes were change in height and knee-heel length, and secondary outcomes included body composition by bioimpedance analysis (ISRCTN13093195).</p>\n",
       "<p>Between February and September 2020, we enrolled 750 children with a median age of 30 (interquartile range 23 to 41) months, with mean (± standard deviation) height-for-age z-score (HAZ) −3.02 ± 0.74 and 12.7% (95) were breastfed. The 750 children were randomized to LNS (<em>n</em> = 600) with or without MP (<em>n</em> = 299 versus <em>n</em> = 301) and WP (<em>n</em> = 301 versus <em>n</em> = 299), or no supplementation (<em>n</em> = 150); 736 (98.1%), evenly distributed between groups, completed 12-week follow-up. Eleven serious adverse events occurred in 10 (1.3%) children, mainly hospitalization with malaria and anemia, all deemed unrelated to the intervention.</p>\n",
       "<p>Unsupplemented children had 0.06 (95% confidence interval, CI [0.02, 0.10]; <em>p</em> = 0.015) decline in HAZ, accompanied by 0.29 (95% CI [0.20, 0.39]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) kg/m<sup>2</sup> increase in fat mass index (FMI), but 0.06 (95% CI [−0.002; 0.12]; <em>p</em> = 0.057) kg/m<sup>2</sup> decline in fat-free mass index (FFMI).</p>\n",
       "<p>There were no interactions between MP and WP. The main effects of MP were 0.03 (95% CI [−0.10, 0.16]; <em>p</em> = 0.662) cm in height and 0.2 (95% CI [−0.3, 0.7]; <em>p</em> = 0.389) mm in knee-heel length. The main effects of WP were −0.08 (95% CI [−0.21, 0.05]; <em>p</em> = 220) cm and −0.2 (95% CI [−0.7; 0.3]; <em>p</em> = 403) mm, respectively. Interactions were found between WP and breastfeeding with respect to linear growth (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.02), due to positive effects among breastfed and negative effects among non-breastfed children.</p>\n",
       "<p>Overall, LNS resulted in 0.56 (95% CI [0.42, 0.70]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) cm height increase, corresponding to 0.17 (95% CI [0.13, 0.21]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) HAZ increase, and 0.21 (95% CI [0.14, 0.28]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) kg weight increase, of which 76.5% (95% CI [61.9; 91.1]) was fat-free mass. Using height-adjusted indicators, LNS increased FFMI (0.07 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI [0.0001; 0.13]; <em>p</em> = 0.049), but not FMI (0.01 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI [−0.10, 0.12]; <em>p</em> = 0.800). Main limitations were lack of blinding of caregivers and short study duration.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>Adding dairy to LNS has no additional effects on linear growth or body composition in stunted children aged 12 to 59 months. However, supplementation with LNS, irrespective of milk, supports linear catch-up growth and accretion of fat-free mass, but not fat mass. If left untreated, children already on a stunting trajectory gain fat at the expense of fat-free mass, thus nutrition programs to treat such children should be considered.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Despite significant global progress in reducing neonatal mortality, bacterial sepsis remains a major cause of neonatal deaths. <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> (<em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em>) is the leading pathogen globally underlying cases of neonatal sepsis and is frequently resistant to antibiotic treatment regimens recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), including first-line therapy with ampicillin and gentamicin, second-line therapy with amikacin and ceftazidime, and meropenem. Maternal vaccination to prevent neonatal infection could reduce the burden of <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> neonatal sepsis in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), but the potential impact of vaccination remains poorly quantified. We estimated the potential impact of such vaccination on cases and deaths of <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> neonatal sepsis and project the global effects of routine immunization of pregnant women with the <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> vaccine as antimicrobial resistance (AMR) increases.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We developed a Bayesian mixture-modeling framework to estimate the effects of a hypothetical <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> maternal vaccine with 70% efficacy administered with coverage equivalent to that of the maternal tetanus vaccine on neonatal sepsis infections and mortality. To parameterize our model, we used data from 3 global studies of neonatal sepsis and/or mortality—with 2,330 neonates who died with sepsis surveilled from 2016 to 2020 undertaken in 18 mainly LMICs across all WHO regions (Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Uganda, Brazil, Italy, Greece, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Thailand, China, and Vietnam). Within these studies, 26.95% of fatal neonatal sepsis cases were culture-positive for <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em>. We analyzed 9,070 <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> genomes from human isolates gathered globally from 2001 to 2020 to quantify the temporal rate of acquisition of AMR genes in <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> isolates to predict the future number of drug-resistant cases and deaths that could be averted by vaccination.</p>\n",
       "<p>Resistance rates to carbapenems are increasing most rapidly and 22.43% [95th percentile Bayesian credible interval (CrI): 5.24 to 41.42] of neonatal sepsis deaths are caused by meropenem-resistant <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em>. Globally, we estimate that maternal vaccination could avert 80,258 [CrI: 18,084 to 189,040] neonatal deaths and 399,015 [CrI: 334,523 to 485,442] neonatal sepsis cases yearly worldwide, accounting for more than 3.40% [CrI: 0.75 to 8.01] of all neonatal deaths. The largest relative benefits are in Africa (Sierra Leone, Mali, Niger) and South-East Asia (Bangladesh) where vaccination could avert over 6% of all neonatal deaths. Nevertheless, our modeling only considers country-level trends in <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> neonatal sepsis deaths and is unable to consider within-country variability in bacterial prevalence that may impact the projected burden of sepsis.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>A <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> maternal vaccine could have widespread, sustained global benefits as AMR in <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> continues to increase.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends systematic symptom screening for tuberculosis (TB). However, TB prevalence surveys suggest that this strategy does not identify millions of TB patients, globally. Undiagnosed or delayed diagnosis of TB contribute to TB transmission and exacerbate morbidity and mortality. We conducted a cluster-randomized trial of large urban and rural primary healthcare clinics in 3 provinces of South Africa to evaluate whether a novel intervention of targeted universal testing for TB (TUTT) in high-risk groups diagnosed more patients with TB per month compared to current standard of care (SoC) symptom-directed TB testing.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>Sixty-two clinics were randomized; with initiation of the intervention clinics over 6 months from March 2019. The study was prematurely stopped in March 2020 due to clinics restricting access to patients, and then a week later due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) national lockdown; by then, we had accrued a similar number of TB diagnoses to that of the power estimates and permanently stopped the trial. In intervention clinics, attendees living with HIV, those self-reporting a recent close contact with TB, or a prior episode of TB were all offered a sputum test for TB, irrespective of whether they reported symptoms of TB. We analyzed data abstracted from the national public sector laboratory database using Poisson regression models and compared the mean number of TB patients diagnosed per clinic per month between the study arms. Intervention clinics diagnosed 6,777 patients with TB, 20.7 patients with TB per clinic month (95% CI 16.7, 24.8) versus 6,750, 18.8 patients with TB per clinic month (95% CI 15.3, 22.2) in control clinics during study months. A direct comparison, adjusting for province and clinic TB case volume strata, did not show a significant difference in the number of TB cases between the 2 arms, incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.14 (95% CI 0.94, 1.38, <em>p</em> = 0.46). However, prespecified difference-in-differences analyses showed that while the rate of TB diagnoses in control clinics decreased over time, intervention clinics had a 17% relative increase in TB patients diagnosed per month compared to the prior year, interaction IRR 1.17 (95% CI 1.14, 1.19, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). Trial limitations were the premature stop due to COVID-19 lockdowns and the absence of between-arm comparisons of initiation and outcomes of TB treatment in those diagnosed with TB.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>Our trial suggests that the implementation of TUTT in these 3 groups at extreme risk of TB identified more TB patients than SoC and could assist in reducing undiagnosed TB patients in settings of high TB prevalence.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Growing evidence suggests an important contribution of airborne transmission to the overall spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in particular via smaller particles called aerosols. However, the contribution of school children to SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to assess transmission of airborne respiratory infections and the association with infection control measures in schools using a multiple-measurement approach.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We collected epidemiological (cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)), environmental (CO<sub>2</sub>, aerosol and particle concentrations), and molecular data (bioaerosol and saliva samples) over 7 weeks from January to March 2022 (Omicron wave) in 2 secondary schools (<em>n</em> = 90, average 18 students/classroom) in Switzerland. We analyzed changes in environmental and molecular characteristics between different study conditions (no intervention, mask wearing, air cleaners). Analyses of environmental changes were adjusted for different ventilation, the number of students in class, school and weekday effects. We modeled disease transmission using a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model, adjusting for absent students and community transmission.</p>\n",
       "<p>Molecular analysis of saliva (21/262 positive) and airborne samples (10/130) detected SARS-CoV-2 throughout the study (weekly average viral concentration 0.6 copies/L) and occasionally other respiratory viruses. Overall daily average CO<sub>2</sub> levels were 1,064 <em>±</em> 232 ppm (<em>±</em> standard deviation). Daily average aerosol number concentrations without interventions were 177 <em>±</em> 109 1/cm<sup>3</sup> and decreased by 69% (95% CrI 42% to 86%) with mask mandates and 39% (95% CrI 4% to 69%) with air cleaners. Compared to no intervention, the transmission risk was lower with mask mandates (adjusted odds ratio 0.19, 95% CrI 0.09 to 0.38) and comparable with air cleaners (1.00, 95% CrI 0.15 to 6.51).</p>\n",
       "<p>Study limitations include possible confounding by period as the number of susceptible students declined over time. Furthermore, airborne detection of pathogens document exposure but not necessarily transmission.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>Molecular detection of airborne and human SARS-CoV-2 indicated sustained transmission in schools. Mask mandates were associated with greater reductions in aerosol concentrations than air cleaners and with lower transmission. Our multiple-measurement approach could be used to continuously monitor transmission risk of respiratory infections and the effectiveness of infection control measures in schools and other congregate settings.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>The Eastern European country of Georgia initiated a nationwide hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination program in 2015 to address a high burden of infection. Screening for HCV infection through antibody testing was integrated into multiple existing programs, including the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP). We sought to compare the hepatitis C care cascade among patients with and without tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis in Georgia between 2015 and 2019 and to identify factors associated with loss to follow-up (LTFU) in hepatitis C care among patients with TB.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>Using national ID numbers, we merged databases of the HCV elimination program, NTP, and national death registry from January 1, 2015 to September 30, 2020. The study population included 11,985 adults (aged ≥18 years) diagnosed with active TB from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2019, and 1,849,820 adults tested for HCV antibodies between January 1, 2015 and September 30, 2020, who were not diagnosed with TB during that time. We estimated the proportion of patients with and without TB who were LTFU at each step of the HCV care cascade and explored temporal changes. Among 11,985 patients with active TB, 9,065 (76%) patients without prior hepatitis C treatment were tested for HCV antibodies, of which 1,665 (18%) had a positive result; LTFU from hepatitis C care was common, with 316 of 1,557 (20%) patients with a positive antibody test not undergoing viremia testing and 443 of 1,025 (43%) patients with viremia not starting treatment for hepatitis C. Overall, among persons with confirmed viremic HCV infection, due to LTFU at various stages of the care cascade only 28% of patients with TB had a documented cure from HCV infection, compared to 55% among patients without TB. LTFU after positive antibody testing substantially decreased in the last 3 years, from 32% among patients diagnosed with TB in 2017 to 12% among those diagnosed in 2019. After a positive HCV antibody test, patients without TB had viremia testing sooner than patients with TB (hazards ratio [HR] = 1.46, 95% confidence intervals [CI] [1.39, 1.54], <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). After a positive viremia test, patients without TB started hepatitis C treatment sooner than patients with TB (HR = 2.05, 95% CI [1.87, 2.25], <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). In the risk factor analysis adjusted for age, sex, and case definition (new versus previously treated), multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB was associated with an increased risk of LTFU after a positive HCV antibody test (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.41, 95% CI [1.12, 1.76], <em>p</em> = 0.003). The main limitation of this study was that due to the reliance on existing electronic databases, we were unable to account for the impact of all confounding factors in some of the analyses.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>LTFU from hepatitis C care after a positive antibody or viremia test was high and more common among patients with TB than in those without TB. Better integration of TB and hepatitis C care systems can potentially reduce LTFU and improve patient outcomes both in Georgia and other countries that are initiating or scaling up their nationwide hepatitis C control efforts and striving to provide personalized TB treatment.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Self-reported adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been modestly inversely associated with incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in cohort studies. There is uncertainty about the validity and magnitude of this association due to subjective reporting of diet. The association has not been evaluated using an objectively measured biomarker of the Mediterranean diet.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We derived a biomarker score based on 5 circulating carotenoids and 24 fatty acids that discriminated between the Mediterranean or habitual diet arms of a parallel design, 6-month partial-feeding randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted between 2013 and 2014, the MedLey trial (128 participants out of 166 randomised). We applied this biomarker score in an observational study, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-InterAct case-cohort study, to assess the association of the score with T2D incidence over an average of 9.7 years of follow-up since the baseline (1991 to 1998). We included 22,202 participants, of whom 9,453 were T2D cases, with relevant biomarkers from an original case-cohort of 27,779 participants sampled from a cohort of 340,234 people. As a secondary measure of the Mediterranean diet, we used a score estimated from dietary-self report. Within the trial, the biomarker score discriminated well between the 2 arms; the cross-validated C-statistic was 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 0.94). The score was inversely associated with incident T2D in EPIC-InterAct: the hazard ratio (HR) per standard deviation of the score was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.65 to 0.77) following adjustment for sociodemographic, lifestyle and medical factors, and adiposity. In comparison, the HR per standard deviation of the self-reported Mediterranean diet was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86 to 0.95). Assuming the score was causally associated with T2D, higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet in Western European adults by 10 percentiles of the score was estimated to reduce the incidence of T2D by 11% (95% CI: 7% to 14%). The study limitations included potential measurement error in nutritional biomarkers, unclear specificity of the biomarker score to the Mediterranean diet, and possible residual confounding.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>These findings suggest that objectively assessed adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with lower risk of T2D and that even modestly higher adherence may have the potential to reduce the population burden of T2D meaningfully.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Home working has increased since the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic’s onset with concerns that it may have adverse health implications. We assessed the association between home working and social and mental wellbeing among the employed population aged 16 to 66 through harmonised analyses of 7 UK longitudinal studies.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We estimated associations between home working and measures of psychological distress, low life satisfaction, poor self-rated health, low social contact, and loneliness across 3 different stages of the pandemic (T1 = April to June 2020 –first lockdown, T2 = July to October 2020 –eased restrictions, T3 = November 2020 to March 2021 –second lockdown) using modified Poisson regression and meta-analyses to pool results across studies. We successively adjusted the model for sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex), job characteristics (e.g., sector of activity, pre-pandemic home working propensities), and pre-pandemic health. Among respectively 10,367, 11,585, and 12,179 participants at T1, T2, and T3, we found higher rates of home working at T1 and T3 compared with T2, reflecting lockdown periods. Home working was not associated with psychological distress at T1 (RR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.79 to 1.08) or T2 (RR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.88 to 1.11), but a detrimental association was found with psychological distress at T3 (RR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.30). Study limitations include the fact that pre-pandemic home working propensities were derived from external sources, no information was collected on home working dosage and possible reverse association between change in wellbeing and home working likelihood.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>No clear evidence of an association between home working and mental wellbeing was found, apart from greater risk of psychological distress during the second lockdown, but differences across subgroups (e.g., by sex or level of education) may exist. Longer term shifts to home working might not have adverse impacts on population wellbeing in the absence of pandemic restrictions but further monitoring of health inequalities is required.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>While the United Kingdom National Health Service aimed to reduce social inequalities in the provision of joint replacement, it is unclear whether these gaps have reduced. We describe secular trends in the provision of primary hip and knee replacement surgery between social deprivation groups.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We used the National Joint Registry to identify all hip and knee replacements performed for osteoarthritis from 2007 to 2017 in England. The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2015 was used to identify the relative level of deprivation of the patient living area. Multilevel negative binomial regression models were used to model the differences in rates of joint replacement. Choropleth maps of hip and knee replacement provision were produced to identify the geographical variation in provision by Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs).</p>\n",
       "<p>A total of 675,342 primary hip and 834,146 primary knee replacements were studied. The mean age was 70 years old (standard deviation: 9) with 60% and 56% of women undergoing hip and knee replacements, respectively. The overall rate of hip replacement increased from 27 to 36 per 10,000 person-years and knee replacement from 33 to 46. Inequalities of provision between the most (reference) and least affluent areas have remained constant for both joints (hip: rate ratio (RR) = 0.58, 95% confidence interval [0.56, 0.60] in 2007, RR = 0.59 [0.58, 0.61] in 2017; knee: RR = 0.82 [0.80, 0.85] in 2007, RR = 0.81 [0.80, 0.83] in 2017). For hip replacement, CCGs with the highest concentration of deprived areas had lower overall provision rates, and CCGs with very few deprived areas had higher provision rates. There was no clear pattern of provision inequalities between CCGs and deprivation concentration for knee replacement.</p>\n",
       "<p>Study limitations include the lack of publicly available information to explore these inequalities beyond age, sex, and geographical area. Information on clinical need for surgery or patient willingness to access care were unavailable.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>In this study, we found that there were inequalities, which remained constant over time, especially in the provision of hip replacement, by degree of social deprivation. Providers of healthcare need to take action to reduce this unwarranted variation in provision of surgery.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>There remains uncertainty about the impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on mental health. This umbrella review provides a comprehensive overview of the association between the pandemic and common mental disorders. We qualitatively summarized evidence from reviews with meta-analyses of individual study-data in the general population, healthcare workers, and specific at-risk populations.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>A systematic search was carried out in 5 databases for peer-reviewed systematic reviews with meta-analyses of prevalence of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms during the pandemic published between December 31, 2019 until August 12, 2022. We identified 123 reviews of which 7 provided standardized mean differences (SMDs) either from longitudinal pre- to during pandemic study-data or from cross-sectional study-data compared to matched pre-pandemic data. Methodological quality rated with the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews checklist scores (AMSTAR 2) instrument was generally low to moderate. Small but significant increases of depression, anxiety, and/or general mental health symptoms were reported in the general population, in people with preexisting physical health conditions, and in children (3 reviews; SMDs ranged from 0.11 to 0.28). Mental health and depression symptoms significantly increased during periods of social restrictions (1 review; SMDs of 0.41 and 0.83, respectively) but anxiety symptoms did not (SMD: 0.26). Increases of depression symptoms were generally larger and longer-lasting during the pandemic (3 reviews; SMDs depression ranged from 0.16 to 0.23) than those of anxiety (2 reviews: SMDs 0.12 and 0.18). Females showed a significantly larger increase in anxiety symptoms than males (1 review: SMD 0.15). In healthcare workers, people with preexisting mental disorders, any patient group, children and adolescents, and in students, no significant differences from pre- to during pandemic were found (2 reviews; SMD’s ranging from −0.16 to 0.48). In 116 reviews pooled cross-sectional prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms ranged from 9% to 48% across populations. Although heterogeneity between studies was high and largely unexplained, assessment tools and cut-offs used, age, sex or gender, and COVID-19 exposure factors were found to be moderators in some reviews. The major limitations are the inability to quantify and explain the high heterogeneity across reviews included and the shortage of within-person data from multiple longitudinal studies.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>A small but consistent deterioration of mental health and particularly depression during early pandemic and during social restrictions has been found in the general population and in people with chronic somatic disorders. Also, associations between mental health and the pandemic were stronger in females and younger age groups than in others. Explanatory individual-level, COVID-19 exposure, and time-course factors were scarce and showed inconsistencies across reviews. For policy and research, repeated assessments of mental health in population panels including vulnerable individuals are recommended to respond to current and future health crises.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Why was this study done?</h3>\n",
       "<p>The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been one of the greatest global public health challenges of the last century and has impacted multiple aspects of health and public life.</p>\n",
       "<p>An adverse association between the pandemic and global mental health was expected and many research projects have been rapidly developed to assess this.</p>\n",

       "<p>The interpretability of the included systematic reviews was limited by the great variation in prevalence rates and associations between studies and because of the scarcity of longitudinal data.</p>\n",

       "<p>We synthesized evidence from 123 systematic reviews of individual studies on symptoms of common mental disorders, including depression, anxiety, and PTSD, in general and specific populations and in healthcare workers. Seven reviews compared differences in mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic or during implementation of public health and social measures to pre-pandemic periods or periods with minimal restrictions. Another 116 reviews provided combined data on during pandemic prevalence rates of mental health outcomes.</p>\n",
       "<p>Mental health and particularly mood of the general population slightly deteriorated in the first half year of the pandemic, and symptom increases were associated with periods of public health measures and social restrictions. Also, people with preexisting physical health conditions, females, and young people showed pandemic-associated increases in symptoms.</p>\n",
       "<p>Variation in pandemic-associated mental health prevalence rates between individual studies was large and often unexplained. In several reviews, methodological, individual-level, and COVID-19 exposure factors did explain some of the variation but in others this was not the case.

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is associated with a suboptimal intrauterine environment, which may adversely impact fetal neurodevelopment. However, analysing neurodevelopmental outcomes by observed birthweight fails to differentiate between true FGR and constitutionally small infants and cannot account for iatrogenic intervention. This study aimed to determine the relationship between antenatal FGR and mid-childhood (age 5 to 7 years) educational outcomes.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>The Pregnancy Outcome Prediction Study (2008–2012) was a prospective birth cohort conducted in a single maternity hospital in Cambridge, United Kingdom. Clinicians were blinded to the antenatal diagnosis of FGR. FGR was defined as estimated fetal weight (EFW) &lt;10th percentile at approximately 36 weeks of gestation, plus one or more indicators of placental dysfunction, including ultrasonic markers and maternal serum levels of placental biomarkers. A total of 2,754 children delivered at term were divided into 4 groups: FGR, appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) with markers of placental dysfunction, healthy small-for-gestational age (SGA), and healthy AGA (referent). Educational outcomes (assessed at 5 to 7 years using UK national standards) were assessed with respect to FGR status using regression models adjusted for relevant covariates, including maternal, pregnancy, and socioeconomic factors.</p>\n",
       "<p>Compared to healthy AGA (<em>N =</em> 1,429), children with FGR (<em>N</em> = 250) were at higher risk of “below national standard” educational performance at 6 years (18% versus 11%; aOR 1.68; 95% CI 1.12 to 2.48, <em>p</em> = 0.01). By age 7, children with FGR were more likely to perform below standard in reading (21% versus 15%; aOR 1.46; 95% CI 0.99 to 2.13, <em>p</em> = 0.05), writing (28% versus 23%; aOR 1.46; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.07, <em>p</em> = 0.04), and mathematics (24% versus 16%; aOR 1.49; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.15, <em>p</em> = 0.03). This was consistent whether FGR was defined by ultrasound or biochemical markers. The educational attainment of healthy SGA children (<em>N =</em> 126) was comparable to healthy AGA, although this comparison may be underpowered. Our study design relied on linkage of routinely collected educational data according to nationally standardised metrics; this design allowed a high percentage of eligible participants to be included in the analysis (75%) but excludes those children educated outside of government-funded schools in the UK. Our focus on pragmatic and validated measures of educational attainment does not exclude more subtle effects of the intrauterine environment on specific aspects of neurodevelopment.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>Compared to children with normal fetal growth and no markers of placental dysfunction, FGR is associated with poorer educational attainment in mid-childhood.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Some studies have identified declines in mental health during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in different age groups, including older people. As anxiety and depression are common neuropsychiatric symptoms among people with cognitive impairment, the mental health experiences of older people during the pandemic should take cognitive function into consideration, along with assessments made prior to the pandemic. This study addresses evidence gaps to test whether changes in depression and anxiety among older people through the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with cognitive impairment. It also investigates whether associations varied according to key sources of sociodemographic inequality.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>Using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) collected from 2018/2019 to November/December 2020, we estimated changes in depression and anxiety for people aged 50+ in England across 3 cognitive function groups: no impairment, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. Conditional growth curve models were estimated for continuous measures over 3 time points (<em>N =</em> 5,286), with mixed-effects logistic regression used for binary measures. All models adjusted for demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, and cohabiting partnership), socioeconomics (education, wealth, and employment status), geography (urban/rural and English region), and health (self-rated and the presence of multimorbidity).</p>\n",
       "<p>We found that depression (measured with CES-D score) worsened from 2018/2019 to November/December 2020 for people with mild cognitive impairment (1.39 (95% CI: 1.29 to 1.49) to 2.16 (2.02 to 2.30)) or no impairment (1.17 (95%CI: 1.12 to 1.22) to 2.03 (1.96 to 2.10)). Anxiety, using a single-item rating of 0 to 10 also worsened among those with mild cognitive impairment (2.48 (2.30 to 2.66) to 3.14 (2.95 to 3.33)) or no impairment (2.20 (2.11 to 2.28) to 2.85 (2.77 to 2.95)). No statistically significant increases were found for those with dementia. Using a clinical cutoff for likely depression (CES-D ≥4), we found statistically significant increases in the probability of depression between 2018/2019 and November/December 2020 for those with no impairment (0.110 (0.099 to 0.120) to 0.206 (0.191 to 0.222)) and mild impairment (0.139 (0.120 to 0.159) to 0.234 (0.204 to 0.263)).</p>\n",
       "<p>We also found that differences according to cognitive function that existed before the pandemic were no longer present by June/July 2020, and there were no statistically significant differences in depression or anxiety among cognitive groups in November/December 2020. Wealth and education appeared to be stronger drivers for depression and anxiety, respectively, than cognitive impairment. For example, those with no impairment in the richest two-thirds scored 1.76 (1.69 to 1.82) for depression in June/July, compared to 2.01 (1.91 to 2.12) for those with no impairment in the poorest third and 2.03 (1.87 to 2.19) for those with impairment in the poorest third. Results may be limited by the small number of people with dementia and are generalizable only to people living in the community, not to those in institutional care settings.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>Our findings suggest a convergence in mental health across cognitive function groups during the pandemic. This suggests mental health services will need to meet an increased demand from older adults, especially those not living with cognitive impairment. Further, with little significant change among those with dementia, their existing need for support will remain; policymakers and care practitioners should ensure this group continues to have equitable access to mental health support.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>The growing population of adolescents and young people (AYP) aged 15 to 24 in sub-Saharan Africa face a high burden of HIV in many settings. Unintended pregnancies among adolescent girls in the region remain high. Nonetheless, the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) service needs of AYP have remained underserved. We conducted a cluster-randomised trial (CRT) to estimate the impact of community-based, peer-led SRH service provision on knowledge of HIV status and other SRH outcomes, including met need for contraceptives.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>Yathu Yathu was a cluster-randomised trial (CRT) conducted from 2019 to 2021 in 2 urban communities in Lusaka, Zambia. The communities were divided into 20 zones (approximately 2,350 AYP/zone) that were randomly allocated to the Yathu Yathu intervention or control arm. In each intervention zone, a community-based hub, staffed by peer support workers, was established to provide SRH services. In 2019, a census was conducted in all zones; all consenting AYP aged 15 to 24 were given a Yathu Yathu card, which allowed them to accrue points for accessing SRH services at the hub and health facility (intervention arm) or the health facility only (control arm). Points could be exchanged for rewards, thus acting as an incentive to use SRH services in both arms. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 2021 to estimate the impact of Yathu Yathu on the primary outcome: knowledge of HIV status (self-reporting living with HIV or HIV testing in the last 12 months) and secondary outcomes, including use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in the last 12 months, current use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and met need for contraceptive services. The sampling was stratified on sex and age group, and we analysed data at cluster-level using a two-stage process recommended for CRTs with &lt;15 clusters/arm. A total of 1,989 AYP consented to participate in the survey (50% male); consent was similar across arms (63% consent/arm). Across zones, knowledge of HIV status ranged from 63.6% to 81.2% in intervention zones and 35.4% to 63.0% in control zones. Adjusting for age, sex, and community, knowledge of HIV status was higher in the intervention arm compared to control (73.3% versus 48.4%, respectively, adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) 1.53 95% CI 1.36, 1.72; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). By age and sex, results were similar. There was no evidence for impact on any secondary outcomes, including current use of ART and met need for contraceptives. There were no adverse events reported in either arm. A key limitation of our trial is that approximately 35% of the AYP randomly selected for participation in the endline survey could not be reached.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>Delivering community-based, peer-led SRH services increased knowledge of HIV status among AYP, both males and females, compared with the control arm. Scaling up the highly effective Yathu Yathu strategy has the potential to make a substantial contribution to increasing access to HIV prevention and care services for young people. However, additional implementation research is needed to understand how to improve uptake of broader SRH services, beyond uptake of HIV testing.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>In low- and middle-income countries (L&amp;MICs), the biggest contributing factors to the global burden of disease in childhood are deaths due to respiratory illness and diarrhoea, both of which are closely related to use of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services by households. However, current estimates of the health impacts of WASH interventions use self-reported morbidity, which may fail to capture longer-term or more severe impacts. Reported mortality is thought to be less prone to bias than other reported measures. This study aimed to answer the question: What are the impacts of WASH interventions on reported childhood mortality in L&amp;MICs?</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, using a published protocol. Systematic searches of 11 academic databases and trial registries, plus organisational repositories, were undertaken to locate studies of WASH interventions, which were published in peer review journals or other sources (e.g., organisational reports and working papers). Intervention studies of WASH improvements implemented under endemic disease circumstances in L&amp;MICs were eligible, which reported findings at any time until March 2020. We used the participant flow data supplied in response to journal editors’ calls for greater transparency. Data were collected by two authors working independently.</p>\n",
       "<p>We included evidence from 24 randomized and 11 nonrandomized studies of WASH interventions from all global regions, incorporating 2,600 deaths. Effects of 48 WASH treatment arms were included in analysis. We critically appraised and synthesised evidence using meta-analysis to improve statistical power. We found WASH interventions are associated with a significant reduction of 17% in the odds of all-cause mortality in childhood (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.74, 0.92, evidence from 38 interventions), and a significant reduction in diarrhoea mortality of 45% (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.35, 0.84; 10 interventions).</p>\n",
       "<p>Further analysis by WASH technology indicated interventions providing improved water in quantity to households were most consistently associated with reductions in all-cause mortality. Community-wide sanitation was most consistently associated with reductions in diarrhoea mortality. Around one-half of the included studies were assessed as being at “moderate risk of bias” in attributing mortality in childhood to the WASH intervention, and no studies were found to be at “low risk of bias.” The review should be updated to incorporate additional published and unpublished participant flow data.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>The findings are congruent with theories of infectious disease transmission. Washing with water presents a barrier to respiratory illness and diarrhoea, which are the two biggest contributors to all-cause mortality in childhood in L&amp;MICs. Community-wide sanitation halts the spread of diarrhoea. We observed that evidence synthesis can provide new findings, going beyond the underlying data from trials to generate crucial insights for policy. Transparent reporting in trials creates opportunities for research synthesis to answer questions about mortality, which individual studies of interventions cannot be reliably designed to address.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Antihypertensives are effective at reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, but limited data exist quantifying their association with serious adverse events, particularly in older people with frailty. This study aimed to examine this association using nationally representative electronic health record data.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>This was a retrospective cohort study utilising linked data from 1,256 general practices across England held within the Clinical Practice Research Datalink between 1998 and 2018. Included patients were aged 40+ years, with a systolic blood pressure reading between 130 and 179 mm Hg, and not previously prescribed antihypertensive treatment. The main exposure was defined as a first prescription of antihypertensive treatment. The primary outcome was hospitalisation or death within 10 years from falls. Secondary outcomes were hypotension, syncope, fractures, acute kidney injury, electrolyte abnormalities, and primary care attendance with gout. The association between treatment and these serious adverse events was examined by Cox regression adjusted for propensity score. This propensity score was generated from a multivariable logistic regression model with patient characteristics, medical history and medication prescriptions as covariates, and new antihypertensive treatment as the outcome. Subgroup analyses were undertaken by age and frailty. Of 3,834,056 patients followed for a median of 7.1 years, 484,187 (12.6%) were prescribed new antihypertensive treatment in the 12 months before the index date (baseline). Antihypertensives were associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation or death from falls (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21 to 1.26), hypotension (aHR 1.32, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.35), syncope (aHR 1.20, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.22), acute kidney injury (aHR 1.44, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.47), electrolyte abnormalities (aHR 1.45, 95% CI 1.43 to 1.48), and primary care attendance with gout (aHR 1.35, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.37). The absolute risk of serious adverse events with treatment was very low, with 6 fall events per 10,000 patients treated per year. In older patients (80 to 89 years) and those with severe frailty, this absolute risk was increased, with 61 and 84 fall events per 10,000 patients treated per year (respectively). Findings were consistent in sensitivity analyses using different approaches to address confounding and taking into account the competing risk of death. A strength of this analysis is that it provides evidence regarding the association between antihypertensive treatment and serious adverse events, in a population of patients more representative than those enrolled in previous randomised controlled trials. Although treatment effect estimates fell within the 95% CIs of those from such trials, these analyses were observational in nature and so bias from unmeasured confounding cannot be ruled out.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>Antihypertensive treatment was associated with serious adverse events. Overall, the absolute risk of this harm was low, with the exception of older patients and those with moderate to severe frailty, where the risks were similar to the likelihood of benefit from treatment. In these populations, physicians may want to consider alternative approaches to management of blood pressure and refrain from prescribing new treatment.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Background</strong> Hand hygiene is an important measure to prevent disease transmission.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Objective</strong> To summarise current international guideline recommendations for hand hygiene in community settings and to assess to what extent they are consistent and evidence based.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Eligibility criteria</strong> We included international guidelines with one or more recommendations on hand hygiene in community settings—categorised as domestic, public or institutional—published by international organisations, in English or French, between 1 January 1990 and 15 November 2021.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Data sources</strong> To identify relevant guidelines, we searched the WHO Institutional Repository for Information Sharing Database, Google, websites of international organisations, and contacted expert organisations and individuals.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Charting methods</strong> Recommendations were mapped to four areas related to hand hygiene: (1) effective hand hygiene; (2) minimum requirements; (3) behaviour change and (4) government measures. Recommendations were assessed for consistency, concordance and whether supported by evidence.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> We identified 51 guidelines containing 923 recommendations published between 1999 and 2021 by multilateral agencies and international non-governmental organisations. Handwashing with soap is consistently recommended as the preferred method for hand hygiene across all community settings. Most guidelines specifically recommend handwashing with plain soap and running water for at least 20 s; single-use paper towels for hand drying; and alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) as a complement or alternative to handwashing. There are inconsistent and discordant recommendations for water quality for handwashing, affordable and effective alternatives to soap and ABHR, and the design of handwashing stations. There are gaps in recommendations on soap and water quantity, behaviour change approaches and government measures required for effective hand hygiene. Less than 10% of recommendations are supported by any cited evidence.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusion</strong> While current international guidelines consistently recommend handwashing with soap across community settings, there remain gaps in recommendations where clear evidence-based guidance might support more effective policy and investment.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objective</strong> Use of cannabis for medical reasons has increased in Canada since legalisation of recreational cannabis in 2018. The objective of this study was to examine the pattern of use and perceptions about cannabis for menopause in women aged 35 and over in Alberta, Canada.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> Cross-sectional, web-based survey.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Setting</strong> Online (location of participant residence in Alberta, Canada).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Participants</strong> Self-selected sample of women recruited through social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) between October and December 2020. Inclusion criteria included: identified as woman, ages 35 and over, living in Alberta, Canada.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Primary and secondary outcomes measures</strong> Self-reported data were collected on demographics, menopause status and symptoms, cannabis usage and how participants perceived cannabis. Descriptive statistics, comparative analysis and logistic regression explored relations in cannabis use and participant characteristics.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> Of 1761 responses collected, 1485 were included for analysis. Median age was 49 years; 35% were postmenopausal and 33% perimenopausal. Among analysed responses, 499 (34%) women reported currently using cannabis and 978 (66%) indicated ever using cannabis. Of the 499 current cannabis users, over 75% were using cannabis for medical purposes. Most common reasons for current use were sleep (65%), anxiety (45%) and muscle/joint achiness (33%). In current users, 74% indicated that cannabis was helpful for symptoms. Current cannabis users were more likely to report experiencing menopause symptoms compared with non-users. History of smoking and general health status were associated with current cannabis use.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> Some women are using cannabis for symptoms related to menopause. Further research is required to assess safety and efficacy of cannabis for managing menopause and develop clinical resources for women on cannabis and menopause.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objectives</strong> This review examined the factors influencing communication and engagement with ethnic and racial minority groups in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic. It aimed to answer two main questions: (1) what communication problems people from these communities typically faced during the pandemic? and (2) what strategies and recommendations were suggested to enhance communication and engagement for ethnic and racial minorities during the current COVID-19 pandemic and any similar events in the future?</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> Scoping review.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Data sources</strong> PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PsychINFO and CINAHL. Grey literature was searched within organisations’ websites and a Google search of key terms.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Eligibility criteria for selecting studies</strong> We included original research, case studies, reports (including government and charity reports), systematic and scoping articles and literature reviews in English, published from January 2020 to August 2022.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Data extraction and synthesis</strong> Two researchers independently assessed the literature for eligibility and extracted data from the included literature. The selected papers were analysed and summarised into themes relevant to the research questions. The final review included 38 studies combining published academic papers and grey literature.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> Key themes relating to communication and engagement issues included a lack of trust in authority, a lack of access to information and ineffective communication channels and a lack of timely and culturally responsive materials. To reduce the issues, the papers spoke about the key role of community organisations to provide local support and community leaders as trusted spokespersons. Lastly, key recommendations to reduce inequity and strengthen future pandemic responses focused on the need for collaborations and consultations, increasing the number of bilingual workers and supporting community-led communication efforts.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> The insights gained from the activities and experiences documented in this review during the COVID-19 pandemic should be incorporated into future decision-making and interventions to enhance communication and engagement strategies.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> This nationally representative longitudinal study recorded self-reported incident cataract surgery, and measured biological, clinical and socioeconomical characteristics at baseline and endline.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Setting</strong> In the first stage, 150 county-level units were randomly chosen with a probability-proportional-to-size sampling technique from a sampling frame containing all county-level units. The sample was stratified by region and within region by urban district or rural county and per capita gross domestic product. The final sample of 150 counties fell within 28 provinces of China.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Participants</strong> Urban and rural Chinese persons aged 45 years and older.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Primary and secondary outcome measures</strong> Incident cataract surgery (primary outcome) and the factors associated with incident cataract surgery (secondary outcome).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> Among 16 663 people enrolled in 2011, 13 705 (82.2%) attended follow-up in 2015. Among these, 167 (1.22%) reported incident cataract surgery. Those receiving surgery were significantly older (66.2±8.79 vs 58.3±9.18, p≤0.001) and more likely to report: illiteracy (44.9% vs 27.1%, p&lt;0.001), poor baseline distance vision (49.7% vs 20.0%, p≤0.001), poor baseline near vision (37.1% vs 21.8%, p≤0.001), baseline visual impairment (15.6% vs 5.5%, p≤0.001), diabetes (12.0% vs 7.42%, p≤0.05) and higher baseline depression scores (9.7 vs 8.4 on a scale of 0–30, p≤0.05). In linear regression models, older age, worse distance vision, hypertension or diabetes, illiteracy and lower depression score were significantly associated with undergoing surgery. Results were similar in models including only persons aged ≥60 years, except that urban residence was also associated with surgery. When only those aged ≥60 years with poor vision were included, results were again the same, except that higher household expenditure was also associated with surgery.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> In China, cataract surgical rates remain low; underserved groups such as rural dwellers are less likely to receive cataract surgery.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objectives</strong> We sought to compare the temporal trends in the incidence of death and rehospitalisation for congestive heart failure (CHF) following anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in a Medicare cohort of beneficiaries treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in 2005 (n=1479) with those treated in 2016 through quarter (Q) 2 of 2017 (n=22 432).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> This retrospective analysis examined outcomes using both descriptive and regression analysis to control for differences in patient clinical characteristics over time.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Primary outcome measures</strong> The primary outcomes are 1 year and 2 year rates of mortality and re-hospitalisation for CHF.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Results</strong> The 1 year mortality rate was numerically higher in the 2016 cohort at 10.3% (95% CI 9.9 to 10.7) versus 8.9% (CI 7.4 to 10.3; p=0.068). The 2 year mortality rate was significantly higher in the 2016 cohort at 14.5% (CI 13.9 to 15.1) versus 11.4% (CI 9.2 to 13.6; p&lt;0.01). The 1 year rehospitalisation for CHF was lower in the 2016 cohort at 10.6% (CI 10.0 to 11.2) versus 16.7% (CI 14.0 to 19.4; p&lt;0.001), but the 2 year rate was not significantly different at 19.3% (CI 17.7 to 20.9) versus 20.7% (CI 16.4 to 24.9; p=0.55). After adjustment for covariates with two models, the 1 year mortality increased by 2.3% (CI 0.8 to 3.7; p&lt;0.01) and 4.1% (CI 2.6 to 5.6; p&lt;0.001) in the 2016 cohort. The 2 year adjusted mortality also increased by 4.2% (CI 2.0 to 6.4; p&lt;0.001) and 6.5% (CI 4.2 to 8.7; p&lt;0.001) in the 2016 cohort. The risk adjusted trends for rehospitalisation for CHF were similar to the unadjusted findings.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> Despite prior improvements in STEMI outcomes in the reperfusion era related to the broad adoption of timely PCI, there is a persistent high mortality and CHF burden in Medicare beneficiaries with anterior STEMI. New strategies that address reperfusion injury and enhance myocardial salvage are needed.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objective</strong> A scoping review was undertaken to determine the extent to which existing studies have examined factors influencing healthcare providers’ use of clinical guidelines in low and middle-income country (LMIC) settings and determine which factors constrain or facilitate the use of clinical guidelines by healthcare providers.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> Scoping review.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Data sources</strong> The literature search was conducted using PubMed in January 2021.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Eligibility criteria</strong> We identified empirical studies, published between 2011–2021 in English, which included clinicians and/or nurses as healthcare providers, used a health facility as the study site, and were located in an LMIC.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Data extraction and synthesis</strong> Information extracted from the literature review was organised using themes and the findings synthesised using thematic analysis.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> The review identified five types of interacting factors that influence healthcare providers’ use of and compliance with clinical guidelines. The factors identified are organisational factors, factors relating to individual healthcare providers, attributes of the clinical guidelines, patient-related factors and institutional factors. Organisational factors can be further divided into the physical work environment, organisational culture and working conditions. The effective use of clinical guidelines in LMIC settings is greatly impacted by the contextualisation of clinical guidelines, end-user engagement and alignment of the implementation of clinical guidelines with the institutional arrangements in the broader health system.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusion</strong> The development and evaluation of concrete interventions is vital to facilitate the implementation of clinical guidelines and improve healthcare service quality. Further studies are necessary to examine the relative importance of the five identified factors on the effective use of clinical guidelines in different contexts.</p>\n",

All studies will be included regardless of methodology and text and opinion pieces will also be considered. Studies conducted in any geographical location or setting will be included in the review. Systematic searches of scientific databases such as OVID (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane), NCBI (PubMed), Scopus, PsycINFO, EBSCOhost (CINAHL), Web of Science, Google Scholar and ProQuest will be conducted. In addition, relevant organisational websites, dissertations, theses from university repositories and grey literature will be included. Further articles will be identified by searching references of relevant studies. Studies conducted in English in any year will be included.

It is typically classified as either spontaneous, defined as SCInf without any inciting event, or periprocedural, which typically occur in conjunction with vascular surgery with aortic manipulations. While periprocedural SCInf has recently been the subject of intensified research, especially focusing on the primary prevention of this complication, spontaneous SCInf remains less studied.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Methods and analysis</strong> Electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science and Embase, will be searched using the keywords “spinal cord”, “infarction”, “ischemia” and “spontaneous”. The search will be set to provide only English studies published from database inception. Editorials, letters and reviews will also be excluded. Reference lists of relevant records will also be searched. Identified studies will be screened for inclusion, by one reviewer in the first step and then three in the next step to decrease the risk of bias. The synthesis will address several topics of interest including epidemiology, presentation, diagnostics, treatment strategies, outcomes and predictors. The review aims to gather the body of evidence to summarise the current knowledge on SCInf. This will lead to a better understanding of the condition, its risk factors, diagnosis and management. Moreover, the review will also provide an understanding of the prognosis of patients with SCInf with respect to neurological function, quality of life and mortality. Finally, this overview of the literature will allow the identification of knowledge gaps to help guide future research efforts.</p>\n",

This realist review will follow the Realist and MEta-narrative Evidence Syntheses: Evolving Standards guidance and will be reported as set up by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols statement. The realist programme theory will be developed through a literature review using multiple database searches from 1 November 1999 to 31 June 2022, limited to the English language, and stakeholder consultation, which will be refined throughout the review process. The study findings will be reported by applying the context–mechanism–outcome configuration to gain a deeper understanding of context and underlying mechanisms that influence the implementation of health checks in the prevention and early detection of chronic diseases among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objectives</strong> To systematically synthesise the results of primary qualitative studies on how community-dwelling older adults experience shared decision-making processes, express preferences and actively participate in care.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> Systematic review of qualitative studies and qualitative meta-synthesis.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Methods</strong> We focused on studies about community-dwelling participants aged ≥65 undergoing a health-disease process circumscribed to a primary healthcare setting, and the central theme should focus on either shared decision-making, expressing preferences or patient participation. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus and PsycINFO (time publication frame 2012–2022). We excluded studies in those cases where the qualitative results were not analysed or unrelated to the phenomenon addressed, phenomena were not clear enough to be included or the setting did not occur in the community.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Results</strong> A total of 12 studies were included in this meta-synthesis. We appraised the quality of the selected studies through Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) Checklist. The metasummary comprised the frequency and intensity of qualitative patterns across the included studies. The meta-synthesis revealed four influential elements in their interaction: recognising personal qualities, facing professional characteristics, experiences of discrimination and a double-edged context.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> The phenomena studied were influenced by how older people approached their role in their binomial relationship with healthcare professionals. Those with a reinforced self-concept were better aware of health-disease-related situations regarding shared decision-making and the importance of being communicatively assertive. Professional characteristics were also crucial in how older people modulated their acting ability through their personality, communication skills and the approach healthcare professionals used towards older adults. Situations of discrimination generated through an imbalance of power inhibited the expression of preferences and hindered the active participation of older people. The context surrounding the participants influenced all these situations, key in tipping the balance between a therapeutic and a harmful side.</p>\n",

Acupuncture has shown potential in correcting hemiplegic gait patterns and improving motor function recovery after stroke. However, controversial findings and a lack of supportive evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture for post-stroke hemiplegia. The intelligent gait analysis system provides a new perspective for the study of hemiparetic gait. This systematic review aims to collect relevant studies and critically evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in alleviating gait disturbance of post-stroke hemiplegia based on quantified gait parameters.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Methods and analysis</strong> A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane stroke group trials register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, AMED, three Chinese databases (Chinese Biomedical Literatures database (CBM), National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wan fang Digital Periodicals), four trails registries (The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, The Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, and The Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry) will be conducted to identify randomised controlled trials of acupuncture for gait disturbance in post-stroke patients. No restrictions on language or publication status. The primary outcomes are gait temporospatial parameters (eg, step length, stride length, step width, step frequency (cadence), walking speed, etc), and gait kinematic parameters (eg, hip peak flex/extend angle, knee peak flex/extend angle, ankle peak dorsi/plantar-flexion angle, etc). We will assess bias using the approach recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. A meta-analysis will be conducted to synthesise the evidence for each outcome measure. The χ<sup>2</sup> test and I<sup>2</sup> statistic will be used for assessing heterogeneity between studies.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Introduction</strong> Medical adhesives are adhesives used in medical devices to establish and maintain contact with the body over a period of time (usually by application to the skin) and are widely used in most care settings. Application of medical adhesives to the skin can lead to skin stripping, mild or severe allergic reactions and skin irritation that may manifest as redness, itching or rash. Adhesive-related skin injury can lead to infection, delayed wound healing and an increased risk of scarring. These injuries can cause severe discomfort and pain, and can affect the patient’s quality of life. A systematic review summarising patient’s experiences on this topic will contribute to informing adhesive producers and policy makers, and guiding further development and improvement of available technologies.</p>\n",

In addition, manual searches will be performed, reviewing the reference lists of relevant reviews and articles included for quality assessment. Qualitative studies using various methods will be considered for inclusion. Screening of title, abstract and full text will be done by two reviewers. The methodological quality of studies under consideration will be critically assessed by two reviewers using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool for Qualitative Research.

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objective</strong> This study was designed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with occupational respiratory morbidity among hairdressers in Northwestern Ethiopia.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> A cross-sectional study was conducted from 6 July 2022 to 17 August 2022. The data were collected using a standardised American Thoracic Society questionnaire. The collected data were entered into EpiData V.4.6 and analysed using Stata V.14. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with occupational respiratory morbidity. The association was determined using an adjusted OR (AOR) with a 95% CI at a p value of &lt;0.05.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Setting</strong> The study was conducted in Gondar city, Northwestern Ethiopia.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Participants</strong> A total of 403 hairdressers participated in this study.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Outcome measures</strong> The primary outcome is the prevalence of occupational respiratory morbidity.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> The total response rate was 95.5%. The majority, 250 (62%) of the respondents were women. The mean age (±SD) of the respondents was 27 (±6.0) years. The overall prevalence of occupational respiratory morbidity during the past 12 months was found to be 134 (33.3%) (95% CI (28.7% to 38.1%)). Female hairdressers (18.6%) showed greater respiratory morbidity than male hairdressers (14.7%). Working experience 3–5 years (AOR: 3.05; 95% CI (1.76 to 5.30)) and working experience &gt;5 years (AOR: 6.22; 95% CI (2.73 to 14.16)), overweight (body mass index (BMI)) (AOR: 3.01; 95% CI (1.19 to 7.58)) and working near roadsides (AOR: 2.15; 95% CI (1.33 to 3.37)) were risk factors of occupational respiratory morbidity among hairdressers.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> This study concluded that one-third of hairdressers experienced occupational respiratory morbidity. Longer work experience, higher BMI and working near roadsides were identified as significant risk factors for respiratory morbidity in hairdressers. Dietary calorie restrictions for overweight individuals and the development and implementation of air pollution mitigation measures targeted at roadside workers are advised to curb the problem.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objectives</strong> Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming the leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. However, treatment of NAFLD is potentially influenced by psychological conditions. Using the simplified version of the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA-SV) scale, this study aimed to evaluate the stage of psychological change as a prerequisite to refining implementation strategies for psychological change.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> A multicentre cross-sectional survey.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Setting</strong> Ninety hospitals in China.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Participants</strong> 5181 patients with NAFLD were included in this study.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Outcome measures</strong> All patients completed the URICA-SV questionnaire and were assigned to one of the three stages of change (precontemplation, contemplation or action) according to their readiness scores. A stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent factors associated with the stage of psychological change.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> A total of 4832 (93.3%) patients were included in the precontemplation stage and only 349 (6.7%) considered making a change or preparing to make one. There were significant differences in gender (Cohen’s d=0.039, p=0.005), age (Cohen’s d=−0.327, p&lt;0.001), waist circumference (Cohen’s d=0.143, p=0.003), alanine transaminase (Cohen’s d=0.347, p=0.001), triglyceride (Cohen’s d=0.351, p=0.002), body mass index (BMI; Cohen’s d=0.056, p&lt;0.001), proportion of hyperlipidaemia (Cohen’s d=0.068, p&lt;0.001) and cardiovascular disease (Cohen’s d=0.032, p=0.029), therapeutic regimen (Cohen’s d=0.136, p&lt;0.001), and Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire-Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease overall score (Cohen’s d=−0.420, p&lt;0.001) between patients with NAFLD in the precontemplation stage and those in the contemplation/action stage. Logistic regression identified BMI (HR 0.659, 95% CI 0.469 to 0.928, p=0.017), cardiovascular disease (HR 2.161, 95% CI 1.089 to 4.287, p=0.027) and triglyceride (HR 0.751, 95% CI 0.591 to 0.955, p=0.020) as independent factors predicting psychological change.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> The results demonstrated that very few patients with NAFLD presented psychological condition in the stage of action. Psychological condition was found to be significantly related to BMI, cardiovascular disease and triglyceride factors. Integrated diversity considerations for evaluating psychological change are necessary.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objectives</strong> To assess the effects of interventions authorised by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for prevention of COVID-19 progression to severe disease in outpatients.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Setting</strong> Outpatient treatment.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Participants</strong> Participants with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus irrespective of age, sex and comorbidities.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Interventions</strong> Drug interventions authorised by EMA or FDA.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Primary outcome measures</strong> Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and serious adverse events.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> We included 17 clinical trials randomising 16 257 participants to 8 different interventions authorised by EMA or FDA. 15/17 of the included trials (88.2%) were assessed at high risk of bias. Only molnupiravir and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir seemed to improve both our primary outcomes. Meta-analyses showed that molnupiravir reduced the risk of death (relative risk (RR) 0.11, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.64; p=0.0145, 2 trials; very low certainty of evidence) and serious adverse events (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.84; p=0.0018, 5 trials; very low certainty of evidence). Fisher’s exact test showed that ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir reduced the risk of death (p=0.0002, 1 trial; very low certainty of evidence) and serious adverse events (p<em>&lt;</em>0.0001, 1 trial; very low certainty of evidence) in 1 trial including 2246 patients, while another trial including 1140 patients reported 0 deaths in both groups.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> The certainty of the evidence was very low, but, from the results of this study, molnupiravir showed the most consistent benefit and ranked highest among the approved interventions for prevention of COVID-19 progression to severe disease in outpatients. The lack of certain evidence should be considered when treating patients with COVID-19 for prevention of disease progression.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objective</strong> To summarise the available evidence on the risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, compared with the risk among unvaccinated individuals in the absence of COVID-19 infection.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> Systematic review and meta-analysis.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Data sources</strong> Electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Web of Science and WHO Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease), preprint repositories (medRxiv and bioRxiv), reference lists and grey literature were searched from 1 December 2020 until 31 October 2022.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Study selection</strong> Epidemiological studies of individuals of any age who received at least one dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, reported a risk of myo/pericarditis and compared the risk of myo/pericarditis to individuals who did not receive any dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Data extraction and synthesis</strong> Two reviewers independently conducted screening and data extraction. The rate of myo/pericarditis among vaccinated and unvaccinated groups was recorded, and the rate ratios were calculated. Additionally, the total number of individuals, case ascertainment criteria, percentage of males and history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were extracted for each study. Meta-analysis was done using a random-effects model.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> Seven studies met the inclusion criteria, of which six were included in the quantitative synthesis. Our meta-analysis indicates that within 30-day follow-up period, vaccinated individuals were twice as likely to develop myo/pericarditis in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to unvaccinated individuals, with a rate ratio of 2.05 (95% CI 1.49–2.82).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusion</strong> Although the absolute number of observed myo/pericarditis cases remains quite low, a higher risk was detected in those who received mRNA COVID-19 vaccinations compared with unvaccinated individuals in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in preventing severe illnesses, hospitalisations and deaths, future research should focus on accurately determining the rates of myo/pericarditis linked to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, understanding the biological mechanisms behind these rare cardiac events and identifying those most at risk.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Setting</strong> Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Differences in screening rates were analysed using multivariable logistic regressions, controlling for age, residence, education and wealth. Inequalities in screening probability were estimated using marginal effects models.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Participants</strong> Women aged 25–49 years, reporting screening.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Outcome measures</strong> Self-reported screening rates, and their inequalities in percentage points, with differences of 20%+ defined as high inequality, 5%–20% as medium, 0%–5% as low.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Results</strong> The sample size of participants ranged from 5882 in Ethiopia to 9186 in Tanzania. The screening rates were low in the surveyed countries, ranging from 3.5% (95% CI 3.1% to 4.0%) in Rwanda to 17.1% (95% CI 15.8% to 18.5%) and 17.4% (95% CI 16.1% to 18.8%) in Zambia and Zimbabwe. Inequalities in screening rates were low based on covariates. Combining the inequalities led to significant inequalities in screening probabilities between women living in rural areas aged 25–34 years, with a primary education level, from the lowest wealth quintile, and women living in urban areas aged 35–49 years, with the highest education level, from the highest wealth quintile, ranging from 4.4% in Rwanda to 44.6% in Zimbabwe.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> Cervical precancer screening rates were inequitable and low. No country surveyed achieved one-third of the WHO’s target of screening 70% of eligible women by 2030. Combining inequalities led to high inequalities, preventing women who were younger, lived in rural areas, were uneducated, and from the lowest wealth quintile from screening. Governments should include and monitor equity in their cervical precancer screening programmes.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Introduction</strong> The key tools for mitigating the impact of COVID-19 and reducing its transmission include testing, quarantine and isolation, as well as telemonitoring. Primary healthcare (PHC) can be essential in increasing access to these tools. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to implement and expand an intervention consisting of COVID-19 testing, isolation, quarantine and telemonitoring (TQT) strategies and other prevention measures at PHC services in highly socioeconomically vulnerable neighbourhoods of Brazil.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Methods and analysis</strong> This study will implement and expand COVID-19 testing in PHC services in two large Brazilian capital cities: Salvador and Rio de Janeiro. Qualitative formative research was conducted to understand the testing context in the communities and at PCH services. The TQT strategy was structured in three subcomponents: (1) training and technical support for tailoring the work processes of health professional teams, (2) recruitment and demand creation strategies and (3) TQT. To evaluate this intervention, we will conduct an epidemiological study with two stages: (1) a cross-sectional sociobehavioural survey among individuals from these two communities covered by PHC services, presenting symptoms associated with COVID-19 or being a close contact of a patient with COVID-19, and (2) a cohort of those who tested positive, collecting clinical data.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Ethics and dissemination</strong> The WHO Ethics Research Committee (ERC) (#CERC.0128A and #CERC.0128B) and each city’s local ERC approved the study protocol (Salvador, ISC/UFBA: #53844121.4.1001.5030; and Rio de Janeiro, INI/Fiocruz: #53844121.4.3001.5240, ENSP/Fiocruz: #53844121.4.3001.5240 and SMS/RJ #53844121.4.3002.5279). Findings will be published in scientific journals and presented at meetings. In addition, informative flyers and online campaigns will be developed to communicate study findings to participants, members of communities and key stakeholders.</p>\n",

Twelve (29%) of these met 80% or more of the minimum requirements and were classified as fully functional. Twelve (29%) and 17 (41%) PHEOCs that met 60%–79% and below 60% the minimum requirements were classified as functional and partially functional, respectively.</p>\n",

One-third of the responding countries with a PHEOC have one fulfilling at least 80% of the minimum requirements to operate the critical emergency functions. There are still several African countries that either do not have a PHEOC or whose PHEOCs only partially meet these minimal requirements. This calls for significant collaboration across all stakeholders to establish functional PHEOCs in Africa.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objective</strong> The aim of this study was to assess the level of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and associated factors among hypertensive patients having follow-up at selected hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in 2022.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Setting</strong> A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted in public and tertiary hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 15 January 2022 to 30 July 2022.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Participants</strong> A total of 326 adult hypertensive patients who visited the chronic diseases clinic for follow-up were included in the study.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Primary and secondary outcome measures</strong> A high predicted 10-year CVD risk level was assessed using an interviewer-administered questionnaire and physical measurement (primary data) and reviews of medical data records (secondary data) by using a non-laboratory WHO risk prediction chart. Logistic regression with an adjusted OR (AOR) using a 95% CI was calculated for independent variables associated with 10-year CVD risk.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Results</strong> The prevalence of a high predicted 10-year CVD risk level was 28.2% (95% CI 10.34% to 33.2%) among the study participants. A higher CVD risk level was found to be associated with age (AOR 4.2 for age 64–74, 95% CI 1.67 to 10.66), being male (AOR 2.1, 95% CI 1.18, 3.67), unemployment (AOR 3.2, 95% CI 1.06 to 6.25) and stage 2 systolic blood pressure (AOR 11.32; 95% CI 3.43 to 37.46).</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Conclusion</strong> The study showed that the respondent’s age, gender, occupation and high systolic blood pressure were determinant factors for CVD risks. Therefore, routine screening for the presence of CVD risk factors and assessment of CVD risk are recommended for hypertensive patients for CVD risk reduction.</p>\n",

However, like little is known about whether these drugs are effective and safe when compared in controlled and non-controlled settings. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of second-generation antipsychotics in ASD in randomised controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Methods and analysis</strong> This systematic review will include RCT and prospective cohorts evaluating second-generation antipsychotics in people 5 years and older diagnosed with ASD. Searches will be conducted in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Epistemonikos, Lilacs, CINAHL, PsycINFO, trial registries and grey literature databases without restriction on publication status, year of publication and language. The primary outcomes will be symptoms of aggressive behaviour, quality of life for the individual or their careers, and discontinuation or dropouts/withdrawals of antipsychotics due to adverse events. The secondary outcomes are other not serious adverse events and adherence to pharmacotherapy. Selection, data extraction, and quality assessment will be performed by pairs of reviewers, independently. The Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) and Risk of Bias in Non-Randomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tools will be used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. If appropriate, a meta-analysis and network meta-analysis will be conducted to synthesise the results. The overall quality of the evidence for each outcome will be determined by the Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Introduction</strong> Evidence indicates that, compared with their non-disabled counterparts, disabled people are likely to face greater mental health challenges as well as significant inequalities in accessing appropriate therapeutic support. Currently, little is known about how disabled people perceive and experience counselling and psychotherapy, what barriers/facilitators to therapy delivery and/or therapy participation exist for disabled clients and whether clinicians sufficiently adapt their practice to meet the needs of this diverse but marginalised population. In this paper, we outline a proposal for undertaking a scoping review that aims to identify and synthesise current research relating to disabled individuals’ perceptions of accessibility and experiences of counselling and psychotherapy. The review aims to identify current gaps in the evidence base and inform how future research, practice and policy may develop and foster inclusive strategies and approaches which will support the psychological well-being of disabled clients accessing counselling and psychotherapy.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Methods and analysis</strong> The undertaking and reporting of the proposed scoping review will be guided by the framework outlined by Arksey and O’Malley and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Systematic searches of the PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, EBSCO and Cochrane Library electronic databases will be conducted. Reference lists of relevant studies will be reviewed to identify additional studies. Eligible studies will be limited to those published from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2022 and in the English language. Empirical studies involving disabled individuals receiving and/or who have received a form of therapeutic intervention will be included. Data will be extracted, collated and charted, and will be summarised quantitatively through descriptive numerical analysis and qualitatively through a narrative synthesis.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Ethics and dissemination</strong> The proposed scoping review of published research will not require ethical approval. Results will be disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-7\">The proposed review will be coproduced with a disabled researcher and academic, as well as involve consultation with four disabled people, all of whom have lived or personal experience of participating in and delivering counselling, psychotherapy or mental health services and/or of living with/caring for someone else using similar services. These collaborators were involved in shaping the design of this current protocol and their perspectives will be central to ensuring that the findings and potential recommendations emerging from the full scoping review resonate and reflect the lived experience of disabled people.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-8\">Non-English electronic databases will not be searched. This limitation may lead to language bias.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-9\">The review will not assess the quality of existing research on this topic as scoping reviews do not typically involve methodological appraisal of the included studies.</p>\n"

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Purpose</strong> The purpose of the Radiotherapy Dataset (RTDS) is to collect consistent and comparable data across all providers of National Health Service (NHS)-funded radiotherapy and to provide intelligence for service planning, commissioning, clinical practice and research.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Participants</strong> The RTDS is a mandated dataset requiring providers to collect and submit data monthly for patients treated in England. Data is available from 01 April 2009 to 2 months behind the calendar month.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\">The National Disease Registration Service (NDRS) started receiving data from 01 April 2016. Prior to this, the National Clinical Analysis and Specialised Applications Team (NATCANSAT) were responsible for the RTDS. NDRS holds a copy of the NATCANSAT data for English NHS providers.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\">The RTDS contains clinical information on the primary disease being treated, modality and intent of treatment, dose fractionation and hospital appointment details. Due to constraints in RTDS coding, linkage to the English National Cancer Registration dataset is beneficial.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Findings to date</strong> The RTDS has been linked to the English National Cancer Registration and Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy (SACT) datasets and to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) to provide a more complete picture of the patient cancer pathway. Findings include a study to compare outcomes for patients treated with radical radiotherapy, an investigation of factors influencing 30-day mortality, assessing sociodemographic variation in the use of treatment and a study to assess the service impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A range of other studies have been completed or are ongoing currently.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Future plans</strong> The RTDS can be used for a variety of functions including cancer epidemiological studies to investigate inequalities in treatment access; provide service planning intelligence; monitor clinical practice; and support clinical trial design and recruitment. Collection is to continue indefinitely, with regular updates to the data specification to enable capture of more detailed information on radiotherapy planning and delivery.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Introduction</strong> In the new revised National Institute for Health &amp; Care Excellence (NICE, TA566, 2019) guidelines for cochlear implantation (CI) have clearly stipulated that the hearing loss must be bilateral. Prior to this revision, children and young people (CYP) with asymmetrical thresholds have been considered for unilateral CI when one ear was in audiological criteria. Children with asymmetrical hearing loss represent an important cohort of potential CI candidates, who will continue to be prevented from benefiting from CI unless evidence is produced to support implantation and maximise subsequent benefit.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\">The aim of this study is to evaluate the ‘real-life’ hearing performance in a group of children who have received a unilateral CI and who have hearing thresholds in the contralateral ear that are outside the current UK NICE 2019 audiological criteria for CI. The contralateral ear will be aided using a conventional hearing aid (HA). The outcomes from this ‘bimodal’ group will be compared with a group of children who have received bilateral CI, and a group of children using bilateral HA, to extend the current knowledge about the different performance levels between bilateral CI, bilateral HA and bimodal hearing in CYP.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Methods and analysis</strong> Thirty CYP aged 6–17 years old, 10 bimodal users, 10 bilateral HA users and 10 bilateral cochlear implant users will be subjected to a test battery consisting of: (1) spatial release from masking, (2) complex pitch direction discrimination, (3) melodic identification, (4) perception of prosodic features in speech and (5) TEN test. Subjects will be tested in their optimal device modality. Standard demographic and hearing health information will be collected. In the absence of comparable published data to power the study, sample size was determined on pragmatic grounds. Tests are exploratory and for hypothesis generating purposes. Therefore, the standard criterion of p&lt;0.05 will be used.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Ethics and dissemination</strong> This has been approved by the Health Research Authority and NHS REC within the UK (22/EM/0104).

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Introduction</strong> Intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) is a common cause of stroke worldwide. However, whether the treatment options for symptomatic ICAS is stent placement or medical therapy alone is still controversial. At present, three multicentre randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been published, but their research designs are also slightly different and the conclusions are not completely consistent. Therefore, we plan to conduct a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials to ascertain safety and efficacy of stenting versus medical therapy alone for symptomatic patients with intracranial arterial stenosis.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Methods and analyses</strong> We will identify RCTs comparing stenting vs medical therapy alone in patients with symptomatic ICAS stenosis (70%–99%) through a systematic search, mainly including PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov. Individual-level patient data for a prespecified list of variables will be sought from authors of all eligible studies. The primary outcome was a composite of stroke or death within 30 days, or stroke in territory of qualifying artery beyond 30 days after randomisation. IPD meta-analysis will be conducted with a one-stage approach.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Ethics and dissemination</strong> Ethical approval and individual patient consent will not be required in most cases since this IPD meta-analysis will use pseudoanonymised data from RCTs. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and international conferences.</p>\n",

       "<p id=\"p-2\"><strong>Objectives</strong> There are few reports on regional differences in the supply/utilisation balance and provision of rehabilitation services. This study analysed those regional differences in Japan to help policymakers provide more uniform and efficient rehabilitation services and optimally allocate related resources.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-3\"><strong>Design</strong> An ecological study.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-4\"><strong>Setting</strong> 47 prefectures and 9 regions in Japan in 2017.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-5\"><strong>Primary and secondary outcome measures</strong> Primary measures were ‘supply/utilisation (S/U) ratio’, calculated by dividing rehabilitation supply converted to service units, by rehabilitation utilisation and ‘utilisation/expected utilisation (U/EU) ratio’, calculated by dividing utilisation by EU. The EU was defined as utilisation expected from the demography in each area. Data required to calculate these indicators were collected from open sources such as the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan Open Data Japan.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-6\"><strong>Results</strong> The S/U ratios were higher in Shikoku, Kyusyu, Tohoku and Hokuriku regions, and lower in Kanto and Tokai regions. The number of rehabilitation providers per population was higher mostly in the western part of Japan and lower mostly in the eastern part. The U/EU ratios were also higher mostly in the western part, and lower mostly in the eastern part such as Tohoku and Hokuriku regions. The same trend was seen for cerebrovascular disease and musculoskeletal disorder rehabilitation, which accounted for approximately 84% of rehabilitation services. For disuse syndrome rehabilitation, such a trend did not exist, and the U/EU ratio differed by prefectures.</p>\n",
       "<p id=\"p-7\"><strong>Conclusions</strong> The large surplus in rehabilitation supply in the western part was attributed to the greater number of providers, while the smaller surplus in Kanto and Tokai regions was due to the smaller amount of supply. The number of rehabilitation services used was lesser in the eastern part such as Tohoku and Hokuriku regions, indicating regional differences in the provision of rehabilitation services.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> is the most common pathogen causing neonatal infections, leading to high mortality worldwide. Along with increasing antimicrobial use in neonates, carbapenem-resistant <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> (CRKP) has emerged as a severe challenge for infection control and treatment. However, no comprehensive systematic review is available to describe the global epidemiology of neonatal CRKP infections. We therefore performed a systematic review of available data worldwide and combined a genome-based analysis to address the prevalence, clonal diversity, and carbapenem resistance genes of CRKP causing neonatal infections.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We performed a systematic review of studies reporting population-based neonatal infections caused by CRKP in combination with a genome-based analysis of all publicly available CRKP genomes with neonatal origins. We searched multiple databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane, bioRxiv, and medRxiv) to identify studies that have reported data of neonatal CRKP infections up to June 30, 2022. We included studies addressing the prevalence of CRKP infections and colonization in neonates but excluded studies lacking the numbers of neonates, the geographical location, or independent data on <em>Klebsiella</em> or CRKP isolates. We used narrative synthesis for pooling data with JMP statistical software. We identified 8,558 articles and excluding those that did not meet inclusion criteria. We included 128 studies, none of which were preprints, comprising 127,583 neonates in 30 countries including 21 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) for analysis. We found that bloodstream infection is the most common infection type in reported data. We estimated that the pooled global prevalence of CRKP infections in hospitalized neonates was 0.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2% to 0.3%). Based on 21 studies reporting patient outcomes, we found that the pooled mortality of neonatal CRKP infections was 22.9% (95% CI, 13.0% to 32.9%). A total of 535 neonatal CRKP genomes were identified from GenBank including Sequence Read Archive, of which 204 were not linked to any publications. We incorporated the 204 genomes with a literature review for understanding the species distribution, clonal diversity, and carbapenemase types. We identified 146 sequence types (STs) for neonatal CRKP strains and found that ST17, ST11, and ST15 were the 3 most common lineages. In particular, ST17 CRKP has been seen in neonates in 8 countries across 4 continents. The vast majority (75.3%) of the 1,592 neonatal CRKP strains available for analyzing carbapenemase have genes encoding metallo-β-lactamases and NDM (New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase) appeared to be the most common carbapenemase (64.3%). The main limitation of this study is the absence or scarcity of data from North America, South America, and Oceania.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>CRKP contributes to a considerable number of neonatal infections and leads to significant neonatal mortality. Neonatal CRKP strains are highly diverse, while ST17 is globally prevalent and merits early detection for treatment and prevention. The dominance of <em>bla</em><sub>NDM</sub> carbapenemase genes imposes challenges on therapeutic options in neonates and supports the continued inhibitor-related drug discovery.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Reducing antibiotic treatment duration is a key component of hospital antibiotic stewardship interventions. However, its effectiveness in reducing antimicrobial resistance is uncertain and a clear theoretical rationale for the approach is lacking. In this study, we sought to gain a mechanistic understanding of the relation between antibiotic treatment duration and the prevalence of colonisation with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospitalised patients.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We constructed 3 stochastic mechanistic models that considered both between- and within-host dynamics of susceptible and resistant gram-negative bacteria, to identify circumstances under which shortening antibiotic duration would lead to reduced resistance carriage. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis of antibiotic treatment duration trials, which monitored resistant gram-negative bacteria carriage as an outcome. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for randomised controlled trials published from 1 January 2000 to 4 October 2022, which allocated participants to varying durations of systemic antibiotic treatments. Quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials. The meta-analysis was performed using logistic regression. Duration of antibiotic treatment and time from administration of antibiotics to surveillance culture were included as independent variables. Both the mathematical modelling and meta-analysis suggested modest reductions in resistance carriage could be achieved by reducing antibiotic treatment duration. The models showed that shortening duration is most effective at reducing resistance carriage in high compared to low transmission settings. For treated individuals, shortening duration is most effective when resistant bacteria grow rapidly under antibiotic selection pressure and decline rapidly when stopping treatment. Importantly, under circumstances whereby administered antibiotics can suppress colonising bacteria, shortening antibiotic treatment may increase the carriage of a particular resistance phenotype. We identified 206 randomised trials, which investigated antibiotic duration. Of these, 5 reported resistant gram-negative bacteria carriage as an outcome and were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis determined that a single additional antibiotic treatment day is associated with a 7% absolute increase in risk of resistance carriage (80% credible interval 3% to 11%). Interpretation of these estimates is limited by the low number of antibiotic duration trials that monitored carriage of resistant gram-negative bacteria, as an outcome, contributing to a large credible interval.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>In this study, we found both theoretical and empirical evidence that reducing antibiotic treatment duration can reduce resistance carriage, though the mechanistic models also highlighted circumstances under which reducing treatment duration can, perversely, increase resistance. Future antibiotic duration trials should monitor antibiotic-resistant bacteria colonisation as an outcome to better inform antibiotic stewardship policies.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Single-centre studies suggest that successive Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related “lockdown” restrictions in England may have led to significant changes in the characteristics of major trauma patients. There is also evidence from other countries that diversion of intensive care capacity and other healthcare resources to treating patients with COVID-19 may have impacted on outcomes for major trauma patients. We aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number, characteristics, care pathways, and outcomes of major trauma patients presenting to hospitals in England.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We completed an observational cohort study and interrupted time series analysis including all patients eligible for inclusion in England in the national clinical audit for major trauma presenting between 1 January 2017 and 31 of August 2021 (354,202 patients). Demographic characteristics (age, sex, physiology, and injury severity) and clinical pathways of major trauma patients in the first lockdown (17,510 patients) and second lockdown (38,262 patients) were compared to pre-COVID-19 periods in 2018 to 2019 (comparator period 1: 22,243 patients; comparator period 2: 18,099 patients). Discontinuities in trends for weekly estimated excess survival rate were estimated when lockdown measures were introduced using segmented linear regression.</p>\n",
       "<p>The first lockdown had a larger associated reduction in numbers of major trauma patients (−4,733 (21%)) compared to the pre-COVID period than the second lockdown (−2,754 (6.7%)). The largest reductions observed were in numbers of people injured in road traffic collisions excepting cyclists where numbers increased. During the second lockdown, there were increases in the numbers of people injured aged 65 and over (665 (3%)) and 85 and over (828 (9.3%)).</p>\n",
       "<p>In the second week of March 2020, there was a reduction in level of major trauma excess survival rate (−1.71%; 95% CI: −2.76% to −0.66%) associated with the first lockdown. This was followed by a weekly trend of improving survival until the lifting of restrictions in July 2020 (0.25; 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.35). Limitations include eligibility criteria for inclusion to the audit and COVID status of patients not being recorded.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>This national evaluation of the impact of COVID on major trauma presentations to English hospitals has observed important public health findings: The large reduction in overall numbers injured has been primarily driven by reductions in road traffic collisions, while numbers of older people injured at home increased over the second lockdown. Future research is needed to better understand the initial reduction in likelihood of survival after major trauma observed with the implementation of the first lockdown.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Migraine carries risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. The risk of premature MI (i.e., among young adults) and stroke differs between men and women; previous studies indicate that migraine is mainly associated with an increased risk of stroke among young women. The aim of this study was to examine impact of migraine on the risk of premature (age ≤60 years) MI and ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke among men and women.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>Using Danish medical registries, we conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study (1996 to 2018). Redeemed prescriptions for migraine-specific medication were used to identify women with migraine (<em>n =</em> 179,680) and men with migraine (<em>n</em> = 40,757). These individuals were matched on sex, index year, and birth year 1:5 with a random sample of the general population who did not use migraine-specific medication. All individuals were required to be between 18 and 60 years old. Median age was 41.5 years for women and 40.3 years for men.</p>\n",
       "<p>The main outcome measures to assess impact of migraine were absolute risk differences (RDs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of premature MI, ischemic, and hemorrhagic stroke, comparing individuals with migraine to migraine-free individuals of the same sex. HRs were adjusted for age, index year, and comorbidities. The RD of premature MI for those with migraine versus no migraine was 0.3% (95% CI [0.2%, 0.4%]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) for women and 0.3% (95% CI [−0.1%, 0.6%]; <em>p</em> = 0.061) for men. The adjusted HR was 1.22 (95% CI [1.14, 1.31]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) for women and 1.07 (95% CI [0.97, 1.17]; <em>p</em> = 0.164) for men. The RD of premature ischemic stroke for migraine versus no migraine was 0.3% (95% CI [0.2%, 0.4%]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) for women and 0.5% (95% CI [0.1%, 0.8%]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) for men. The adjusted HR was 1.21 (95% CI [1.13, 1.30]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) for women and 1.23 (95% CI [1.10, 1.38]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) for men. The RD of premature hemorrhagic stroke for migraine versus no migraine was 0.1% (95% CI [0.0%, 0.2%]; <em>p</em> = 0.011) for women and −0.1% (95% CI [−0.3%, 0.0%]; <em>p</em> = 0.176) for men. The adjusted HR was 1.13 (95% CI [1.02, 1.24]; <em>p</em> = 0.014) for women and 0.85 (95% CI [0.69, 1.05]; <em>p</em> = 0.131) for men.</p>\n",
       "<p>The main limitation of this study was the risk of misclassification of migraine, which could lead to underestimation of the impact of migraine on each outcome.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Hospital-associated infections (HAIs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality around the world. Many HAIs are caused by drug-resistant bacterial pathogens, but there are major gaps in our understanding of the number of hospital-associated drug-resistant infections (HARIs) worldwide. As such, we estimated trends in prevalence of HARIs caused by high priority pathogens (<em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Acinetobacter</em> spp., <em>Klebsiella</em> spp., <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Enterobacter</em> spp., and <em>Pseudomonas</em> spp.) in 195 countries.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>Resistance prevalence estimates were extracted from 474-point prevalence surveys (PPS) from 99 countries published between 2010 and 2020 coupled with country-level estimates of hospitalization rates and length of stay. Prevalence estimates were transformed in yearly incidence of HARIs per year by country and income group. We estimate the global number of HARIs per year to be 136 million (95% credible interval (CI) 26 to 246 million) per year, with the highest burden in China (52 million, 95% CI 10 to 95 million), Pakistan (10 million, 95% CI 2 to 18 million), and India (9 million, 95% CI 3 to 15 million). Among income groups, middle-income countries bore the highest burden of HARIs per year (119 million, 95% CI 23 to 215 million). Our analysis was constrained by the limited number of PPS for HARIs, lack of community-associated data on antibiotic-resistant infections, and our population level analysis.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>In this study, we observe, in the absence of systematic surveillance systems for HARIs, a baseline overview of their rates. Our yearly estimates highlight the global threat of HARIs and may help define strategies to tackle resistance in hospital settings.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Alcohol and diabetes are known risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, it is unclear whether the association between alcohol consumption and HCC risk differs by fasting serum glucose level and diabetes. We investigated the dose–response relationship between alcohol consumption and the risk of HCC according to glycemic status.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>This population-based observational cohort study included patients who underwent general health checkups in 2009 using the Korean National Health Insurance Service Database. The primary outcome was HCC incidence, and Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to estimate the relationship between alcohol consumption and HCC risk according to glycemic status. A total of 34,321 patients newly diagnosed with HCC were observed in the median follow-up period of 8.3 years. In the multivariable model, we adjusted for age, sex, smoking, regular exercise, income, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and body mass index. Mild-to-moderate alcohol consumption increased the risk of HCC in all glycemic statuses (normoglycemia: hazard ratio [HR], 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.10; prediabetes: HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.24; and diabetes: HR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.93 to 2.11) compared to normoglycemic nondrinking. Heavy alcohol consumption also increased the risk of HCC in all glycemic statuses (normoglycemia: HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.32 to 1.46; prediabetes: HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.58 to 1.77; and diabetes: HR, 3.29; 95% CI, 3.11 to 3.49) compared to normoglycemic nondrinking. Since alcohol consumption information in this study was based on a self-administered questionnaire, there may be a possibility of underestimation. Although we excluded patients with a history of viral hepatitis using diagnosis codes, we could not obtain information on hepatitis B or hepatitis C serum markers.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>Both mild-to-moderate and heavy alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk of HCC in all glycemic statuses. The increased risk of HCC according to alcohol consumption was the highest in the diabetes group, suggesting that more intensive alcohol abstinence is required for patients with diabetes.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Same-day HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation is being widely implemented. However, the optimal timing of ART among patients with tuberculosis (TB) symptoms is unknown. We hypothesized that same-day treatment (TB treatment for those diagnosed with TB; ART for those not diagnosed with TB) would be superior to standard care in this population.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We conducted an open-label trial among adults with TB symptoms at initial HIV diagnosis at GHESKIO in Haiti; participants were recruited and randomized on the same day. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to same-day treatment (same-day TB testing with same-day TB treatment if TB diagnosed; same-day ART if TB not diagnosed) versus standard care (initiating TB treatment within 7 days and delaying ART to day 7 if TB not diagnosed). In both groups, ART was initiated 2 weeks after TB treatment. The primary outcome was retention in care with 48-week HIV-1 RNA &lt;200 copies/mL, with intention to treat (ITT) analysis. From November 6, 2017 to January 16, 2020, 500 participants were randomized (250/group); the final study visit occurred on March 1, 2021. Baseline TB was diagnosed in 40 (16.0%) in the standard and 48 (19.2%) in the same-day group; all initiated TB treatment. In the standard group, 245 (98.0%) initiated ART at median of 9 days; 6 (2.4%) died, 15 (6.0%) missed the 48-week visit, and 229 (91.6%) attended the 48-week visit. Among all who were randomized, 220 (88.0%) received 48-week HIV-1 RNA testing; 168 had &lt;200 copies/mL (among randomized: 67.2%; among tested: 76.4%). In the same-day group, 249 (99.6%) initiated ART at median of 0 days; 9 (3.6%) died, 23 (9.2%) missed the 48-week visit, and 218 (87.2%) attended the 48-week visit. Among all who were randomized, 211 (84.4%) received 48-week HIV-1 RNA; 152 had &lt;200 copies/mL (among randomized: 60.8%; among tested: 72.0%). There was no difference between groups in the primary outcome (60.8% versus 67.2%; risk difference: −0.06; 95% CI [−0.15, 0.02]; <em>p</em> = 0.14). Two new grade 3 or 4 events were reported per group; none were judged to be related to the intervention. The main limitation of this study is that it was conducted at a single urban clinic, and the generalizability to other settings is uncertain.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>In patients with TB symptoms at HIV diagnosis, we found that same-day treatment was not associated with superior retention and viral suppression. In this study, a short delay in ART initiation did not appear to compromise outcomes.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>There is limited data on antibiotic treatment in hospitalized neonates in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We aimed to describe patterns of antibiotic use, pathogens, and clinical outcomes, and to develop a severity score predicting mortality in neonatal sepsis to inform future clinical trial design.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>Hospitalized infants &lt;60 days with clinical sepsis were enrolled during 2018 to 2020 by 19 sites in 11 countries (mainly Asia and Africa). Prospective daily observational data was collected on clinical signs, supportive care, antibiotic treatment, microbiology, and 28-day mortality. Two prediction models were developed for (1) 28-day mortality from baseline variables (baseline NeoSep Severity Score); and (2) daily risk of death on IV antibiotics from daily updated assessments (NeoSep Recovery Score). Multivariable Cox regression models included a randomly selected 85% of infants, with 15% for validation.</p>\n",
       "<p>A total of 3,204 infants were enrolled, with median birth weight of 2,500 g (IQR 1,400 to 3,000) and postnatal age of 5 days (IQR 1 to 15). 206 different empiric antibiotic combinations were started in 3,141 infants, which were structured into 5 groups based on the World Health Organization (WHO) AWaRe classification. Approximately 25.9% (<em>n</em> = 814) of infants started WHO first line regimens (Group 1—Access) and 13.8% (<em>n</em> = 432) started WHO second-line cephalosporins (cefotaxime/ceftriaxone) (Group 2—“Low” Watch). The largest group (34.0%, <em>n</em> = 1,068) started a regimen providing partial extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)/pseudomonal coverage (piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, or fluoroquinolone-based) (Group 3—“Medium” Watch), 18.0% (<em>n</em> = 566) started a carbapenem (Group 4—“High” Watch), and 1.8% (<em>n</em> = 57) a Reserve antibiotic (Group 5, largely colistin-based), and 728/2,880 (25.3%) of initial regimens in Groups 1 to 4 were escalated, mainly to carbapenems, usually for clinical deterioration (<em>n</em> = 480; 65.9%).</p>\n",
       "<p>A total of 564/3,195 infants (17.7%) were blood culture pathogen positive, of whom 62.9% (<em>n</em> = 355) had a gram-negative organism, predominantly <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> (<em>n</em> = 132) or <em>Acinetobacter</em> spp. (<em>n</em> = 72). Both were commonly resistant to WHO-recommended regimens and to carbapenems in 43 (32.6%) and 50 (71.4%) of cases, respectively. MRSA accounted for 33 (61.1%) of 54 <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> isolates.</p>\n",
       "<p>Overall, 350/3,204 infants died (11.3%; 95% CI 10.2% to 12.5%), 17.7% if blood cultures were positive for pathogens (95% CI 14.7% to 21.1%, <em>n</em> = 99/564). A baseline NeoSep Severity Score had a C-index of 0.76 (0.69 to 0.82) in the validation sample, with mortality of 1.6% (3/189; 95% CI: 0.5% to 4.6%), 11.0% (27/245; 7.7% to 15.6%), and 27.3% (12/44; 16.3% to 41.8%) in low (score 0 to 4), medium (5 to 8), and high (9 to 16) risk groups, respectively, with similar performance across subgroups. A related NeoSep Recovery Score had an area under the receiver operating curve for predicting death the next day between 0.8 and 0.9 over the first week. There was significant variation in outcomes between sites and external validation would strengthen score applicability.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n",
       "<p>Antibiotic regimens used in neonatal sepsis commonly diverge from WHO guidelines, and trials of novel empiric regimens are urgently needed in the context of increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The baseline NeoSep Severity Score identifies high mortality risk criteria for trial entry, while the NeoSep Recovery Score can help guide decisions on regimen change. NeoOBS data informed the NeoSep1 antibiotic trial (ISRCTN48721236), which aims to identify novel first- and second-line empiric antibiotic regimens for neonatal sepsis.</p>\n",

       "<p>An increased risk of myocarditis or pericarditis after priming with mRNA Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines has been shown but information on the risk post-booster is limited. With the now high prevalence of prior Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we assessed the effect of prior infection on the vaccine risk and the risk from COVID-19 reinfection.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We conducted a self-controlled case series analysis of hospital admissions for myocarditis or pericarditis in England between 22 February 2021 and 6 February 2022 in the 50 million individuals eligible to receive the adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1-S) for priming or an mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) for priming or boosting. Myocarditis and pericarditis admissions were extracted from the Secondary Uses Service (SUS) database in England and vaccination histories from the National Immunisation Management System (NIMS); prior infections were obtained from the UK Health Security Agency’s Second-Generation Surveillance Systems. The relative incidence (RI) of admission within 0 to 6 and 7 to 14 days of vaccination compared with periods outside these risk windows stratified by age, dose, and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection for individuals aged 12 to 101 years was estimated. The RI within 27 days of an infection was assessed in the same model. There were 2,284 admissions for myocarditis and 1,651 for pericarditis in the study period. Elevated RIs were only observed in 16- to 39-year-olds 0 to 6 days postvaccination, mainly in males for myocarditis. Both mRNA vaccines showed elevated RIs after first, second, and third doses with the highest RIs after a second dose 5.34 (95% confidence interval (CI) [3.81, 7.48]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) for BNT162b2 and 56.48 (95% CI [33.95, 93.97]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) for mRNA-1273 compared with 4.38 (95% CI [2.59, 7.38]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) and 7.88 (95% CI [4.02, 15.44]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001), respectively, after a third dose. For ChAdOx1-S, an elevated RI was only observed after a first dose, RI 5.23 (95% CI [2.48, 11.01]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). An elevated risk of admission for pericarditis was only observed 0 to 6 days after a second dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine in 16 to 39 year olds, RI 4.84 (95% CI [1.62, 14.01]; <em>p</em> = 0.004). RIs were lower in those with a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection than in those without, 2.47 (95% CI [1.32,4.63]; <em>p</em> = 0.005) versus 4.45 (95% [3.12, 6.34]; <em>p</em> = 0.001) after a second BNT162b2 dose, and 19.07 (95% CI [8.62, 42.19]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) versus 37.2 (95% CI [22.18, 62.38]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) for mRNA-1273 (myocarditis and pericarditis outcomes combined). RIs 1 to 27 days postinfection were elevated in all ages and were marginally lower for breakthrough infections, 2.33 (95% CI [1.96, 2.76]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) compared with 3.32 (95% CI [2.54, 4.33]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) in vaccine-naïve individuals respectively.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>We observed an increased risk of myocarditis within the first week after priming and booster doses of mRNA vaccines, predominantly in males under 40 years with the highest risks after a second dose. The risk difference between the second and the third doses was particularly marked for the mRNA-1273 vaccine that contains half the amount of mRNA when used for boosting than priming. The lower risk in those with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, and lack of an enhanced effect post-booster, does not suggest a spike-directed immune mechanism. Research to understand the mechanism of vaccine-associated myocarditis and to document the risk with bivalent mRNA vaccines is warranted.</p>\n",

       "<p>Antibiotic resistance is a global public health issue, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where antibiotics required to treat resistant infections are not affordable. LMICs also bear a disproportionately high burden of bacterial diseases, particularly among children, and resistance jeopardizes progress made in these areas. Although outpatient antibiotic use is a major driver of antibiotic resistance, data on inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in LMICs are scarce at the community level, where the majority of prescribing occurs. Here, we aimed to characterize inappropriate antibiotic prescribing among young outpatient children and to identify its determinants in 3 LMICs.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We used data from a prospective, community-based mother-and-child cohort (BIRDY, 2012 to 2018) conducted across urban and rural sites in Madagascar, Senegal, and Cambodia. Children were included at birth and followed-up for 3 to 24 months. Data from all outpatient consultations and antibiotics prescriptions were recorded. We defined inappropriate prescriptions as antibiotics prescribed for a health event determined not to require antibiotic therapy (antibiotic duration, dosage, and formulation were not considered). Antibiotic appropriateness was determined a posteriori using a classification algorithm developed according to international clinical guidelines. We used mixed logistic analyses to investigate risk factors for antibiotic prescription during consultations in which children were determined not to require antibiotics. Among the 2,719 children included in this analysis, there were 11,762 outpatient consultations over the follow-up period, of which 3,448 resulted in antibiotic prescription. Overall, 76.5% of consultations resulting in antibiotic prescription were determined not to require antibiotics, ranging from 71.5% in Madagascar to 83.3% in Cambodia. Among the 10,416 consultations (88.6%) determined not to require antibiotic therapy, 25.3% (<em>n</em> = 2,639) nonetheless resulted in antibiotic prescription. This proportion was much lower in Madagascar (15.6%) than in Cambodia (57.0%) or Senegal (57.2%) (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). Among the consultations determined not to require antibiotics, in both Cambodia and Madagascar the diagnoses accounting for the greatest absolute share of inappropriate prescribing were rhinopharyngitis (59.0% of associated consultations in Cambodia, 7.9% in Madagascar) and gastroenteritis without evidence of blood in the stool (61.6% and 24.6%, respectively). In Senegal, uncomplicated bronchiolitis accounted for the greatest number of inappropriate prescriptions (84.4% of associated consultations). Across all inappropriate prescriptions, the most frequently prescribed antibiotic was amoxicillin in Cambodia and Madagascar (42.1% and 29.2%, respectively) and cefixime in Senegal (31.2%). Covariates associated with an increased risk of inappropriate prescription include patient age greater than 3 months (adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) ranged across countries from 1.91 [1.63, 2.25] to 5.25 [3.85, 7.15], <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) and living in rural as opposed to urban settings (aOR ranged across countries from 1.83 [1.57, 2.14] to 4.40 [2.34, 8.28], <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). Diagnosis with a higher severity score was also associated with an increased risk of inappropriate prescription (aOR = 2.00 [1.75, 2.30] for moderately severe, 3.10 [2.47, 3.91] for most severe, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001), as was consultation during the rainy season (aOR = 1.32 [1.19, 1.47], <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). The main limitation of our study is the lack of bacteriological documentation, which may have resulted in some diagnosis misclassification and possible overestimation of inappropriate antibiotic prescription.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n",
       "<p>In this study, we observed extensive inappropriate antibiotic prescribing among pediatric outpatients in Madagascar, Senegal, and Cambodia. Despite great intercountry heterogeneity in prescribing practices, we identified common risk factors for inappropriate prescription. This underscores the importance of implementing local programs to optimize antibiotic prescribing at the community level in LMICs.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>People with comorbidities are underrepresented in clinical trials. Empirical estimates of treatment effect modification by comorbidity are lacking, leading to uncertainty in treatment recommendations. We aimed to produce estimates of treatment effect modification by comorbidity using individual participant data (IPD).</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We obtained IPD for 120 industry-sponsored phase 3/4 trials across 22 index conditions (<em>n</em> = 128,331). Trials had to be registered between 1990 and 2017 and have recruited ≥300 people. Included trials were multicentre and international. For each index condition, we analysed the outcome most frequently reported in the included trials. We performed a two-stage IPD meta-analysis to estimate modification of treatment effect by comorbidity. First, for each trial, we modelled the interaction between comorbidity and treatment arm adjusted for age and sex. Second, for each treatment within each index condition, we meta-analysed the comorbidity–treatment interaction terms from each trial. We estimated the effect of comorbidity measured in 3 ways: (i) the number of comorbidities (in addition to the index condition); (ii) presence or absence of the 6 commonest comorbid diseases for each index condition; and (iii) using continuous markers of underlying conditions (e.g., estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)). Treatment effects were modelled on the usual scale for the type of outcome (absolute scale for numerical outcomes, relative scale for binary outcomes). Mean age in the trials ranged from 37.1 (allergic rhinitis trials) to 73.0 (dementia trials) and percentage of male participants range from 4.4% (osteoporosis trials) to 100% (benign prostatic hypertrophy trials). The percentage of participants with 3 or more comorbidities ranged from 2.3% (allergic rhinitis trials) to 57% (systemic lupus erythematosus trials). We found no evidence of modification of treatment efficacy by comorbidity, for any of the 3 measures of comorbidity. This was the case for 20 conditions for which the outcome variable was continuous (e.g., change in glycosylated haemoglobin in diabetes) and for 3 conditions in which the outcomes were discrete events (e.g., number of headaches in migraine). Although all were null, estimates of treatment effect modification were more precise in some cases (e.g., sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors for type 2 diabetes—interaction term for comorbidity count 0.004, 95% CI −0.01 to 0.02) while for others credible intervals were wide (e.g., corticosteroids for asthma—interaction term −0.22, 95% CI −1.07 to 0.54). The main limitation is that these trials were not designed or powered to assess variation in treatment effect by comorbidity, and relatively few trial participants had &gt;3 comorbidities.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>Assessments of treatment effect modification rarely consider comorbidity. Our findings demonstrate that for trials included in this analysis, there was no empirical evidence of treatment effect modification by comorbidity. The standard assumption used in evidence syntheses is that efficacy is constant across subgroups, although this is often criticised. Our findings suggest that for modest levels of comorbidities, this assumption is reasonable. Thus, trial efficacy findings can be combined with data on natural history and competing risks to assess the likely overall benefit of treatments in the context of comorbidity.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Circulation of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRB) in healthcare facilities is a major public health problem. These settings have been greatly impacted by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, notably due to surges in COVID-19 caseloads and the implementation of infection control measures. We sought to evaluate how such collateral impacts of COVID-19 impacted the nosocomial spread of MRB in an early pandemic context.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We developed a mathematical model in which Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and MRB cocirculate among patients and staff in a theoretical hospital population. Responses to COVID-19 were captured mechanistically via a range of parameters that reflect impacts of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on factors relevant for pathogen transmission. COVID-19 responses include both “policy responses” willingly enacted to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission (e.g., universal masking, patient lockdown, and reinforced hand hygiene) and “caseload responses” unwillingly resulting from surges in COVID-19 caseloads (e.g., abandonment of antibiotic stewardship, disorganization of infection control programmes, and extended length of stay for COVID-19 patients). We conducted 2 main sets of model simulations, in which we quantified impacts of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on MRB colonization incidence and antibiotic resistance rates (the share of colonization due to antibiotic-resistant versus antibiotic-sensitive strains).</p>\n",
       "<p>The first set of simulations represents diverse MRB and nosocomial environments, accounting for high levels of heterogeneity across bacterial parameters (e.g., rates of transmission, antibiotic sensitivity, and colonization prevalence among newly admitted patients) and hospital parameters (e.g., rates of interindividual contact, antibiotic exposure, and patient admission/discharge). On average, COVID-19 control policies coincided with MRB prevention, including 28.2% [95% uncertainty interval: 2.5%, 60.2%] fewer incident cases of patient MRB colonization. Conversely, surges in COVID-19 caseloads favoured MRB transmission, resulting in a 13.8% [−3.5%, 77.0%] increase in colonization incidence and a 10.4% [0.2%, 46.9%] increase in antibiotic resistance rates in the absence of concomitant COVID-19 control policies. When COVID-19 policy responses and caseload responses were combined, MRB colonization incidence decreased by 24.2% [−7.8%, 59.3%], while resistance rates increased by 2.9% [−5.4%, 23.2%]. Impacts of COVID-19 responses varied across patients and staff and their respective routes of pathogen acquisition.</p>\n",
       "<p>The second set of simulations was tailored to specific hospital wards and nosocomial bacteria (methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing <em>Escherichia coli</em>). Consequences of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks were found to be highly context specific, with impacts depending on the specific ward and bacteria evaluated. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks significantly impacted patient MRB colonization only in settings with high underlying risk of bacterial transmission. Yet across settings and species, antibiotic resistance burden was reduced in facilities with timelier implementation of effective COVID-19 control policies.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>Our model suggests that surges in nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission generate selection for the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Timely implementation of efficient COVID-19 control measures thus has 2-fold benefits, preventing the transmission of both SARS-CoV-2 and MRB, and highlighting antibiotic resistance control as a collateral benefit of pandemic preparedness.</p>\n",

       "<p>Despite possible benefits for growth, milk is costly to include in foods for undernourished children. Furthermore, the relative effects of different milk components, milk protein (MP), and whey permeate (WP) are unclear. We aimed to assess the effects of MP and WP in lipid-based nutrient supplement (LNS), and of LNS itself, on linear growth and body composition among stunted children.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We performed a randomized, double-blind, 2 × 2 factorial trial among 12 to 59 months old stunted children in Uganda. Children were randomized to 4 formulations of LNS with MP or soy protein isolate and WP or maltodextrin (100 g/day for 12 weeks) or no supplementation. Investigators and outcome assessors were blinded; however, participants were only blinded to the ingredients in LNS. Data were analyzed based on intention-to-treat (ITT) using linear mixed-effects models adjusted for age, sex, season, and site. Primary outcomes were change in height and knee-heel length, and secondary outcomes included body composition by bioimpedance analysis (ISRCTN13093195).</p>\n",
       "<p>Between February and September 2020, we enrolled 750 children with a median age of 30 (interquartile range 23 to 41) months, with mean (± standard deviation) height-for-age z-score (HAZ) −3.02 ± 0.74 and 12.7% (95) were breastfed. The 750 children were randomized to LNS (<em>n</em> = 600) with or without MP (<em>n</em> = 299 versus <em>n</em> = 301) and WP (<em>n</em> = 301 versus <em>n</em> = 299), or no supplementation (<em>n</em> = 150); 736 (98.1%), evenly distributed between groups, completed 12-week follow-up. Eleven serious adverse events occurred in 10 (1.3%) children, mainly hospitalization with malaria and anemia, all deemed unrelated to the intervention.</p>\n",
       "<p>Unsupplemented children had 0.06 (95% confidence interval, CI [0.02, 0.10]; <em>p</em> = 0.015) decline in HAZ, accompanied by 0.29 (95% CI [0.20, 0.39]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) kg/m<sup>2</sup> increase in fat mass index (FMI), but 0.06 (95% CI [−0.002; 0.12]; <em>p</em> = 0.057) kg/m<sup>2</sup> decline in fat-free mass index (FFMI).</p>\n",
       "<p>There were no interactions between MP and WP. The main effects of MP were 0.03 (95% CI [−0.10, 0.16]; <em>p</em> = 0.662) cm in height and 0.2 (95% CI [−0.3, 0.7]; <em>p</em> = 0.389) mm in knee-heel length. The main effects of WP were −0.08 (95% CI [−0.21, 0.05]; <em>p</em> = 220) cm and −0.2 (95% CI [−0.7; 0.3]; <em>p</em> = 403) mm, respectively. Interactions were found between WP and breastfeeding with respect to linear growth (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.02), due to positive effects among breastfed and negative effects among non-breastfed children.</p>\n",
       "<p>Overall, LNS resulted in 0.56 (95% CI [0.42, 0.70]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) cm height increase, corresponding to 0.17 (95% CI [0.13, 0.21]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) HAZ increase, and 0.21 (95% CI [0.14, 0.28]; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) kg weight increase, of which 76.5% (95% CI [61.9; 91.1]) was fat-free mass. Using height-adjusted indicators, LNS increased FFMI (0.07 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI [0.0001; 0.13]; <em>p</em> = 0.049), but not FMI (0.01 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI [−0.10, 0.12]; <em>p</em> = 0.800). Main limitations were lack of blinding of caregivers and short study duration.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>Adding dairy to LNS has no additional effects on linear growth or body composition in stunted children aged 12 to 59 months. However, supplementation with LNS, irrespective of milk, supports linear catch-up growth and accretion of fat-free mass, but not fat mass. If left untreated, children already on a stunting trajectory gain fat at the expense of fat-free mass, thus nutrition programs to treat such children should be considered.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Despite significant global progress in reducing neonatal mortality, bacterial sepsis remains a major cause of neonatal deaths. <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> (<em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em>) is the leading pathogen globally underlying cases of neonatal sepsis and is frequently resistant to antibiotic treatment regimens recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), including first-line therapy with ampicillin and gentamicin, second-line therapy with amikacin and ceftazidime, and meropenem. Maternal vaccination to prevent neonatal infection could reduce the burden of <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> neonatal sepsis in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), but the potential impact of vaccination remains poorly quantified. We estimated the potential impact of such vaccination on cases and deaths of <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> neonatal sepsis and project the global effects of routine immunization of pregnant women with the <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> vaccine as antimicrobial resistance (AMR) increases.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We developed a Bayesian mixture-modeling framework to estimate the effects of a hypothetical <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> maternal vaccine with 70% efficacy administered with coverage equivalent to that of the maternal tetanus vaccine on neonatal sepsis infections and mortality. To parameterize our model, we used data from 3 global studies of neonatal sepsis and/or mortality—with 2,330 neonates who died with sepsis surveilled from 2016 to 2020 undertaken in 18 mainly LMICs across all WHO regions (Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Uganda, Brazil, Italy, Greece, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Thailand, China, and Vietnam). Within these studies, 26.95% of fatal neonatal sepsis cases were culture-positive for <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em>. We analyzed 9,070 <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> genomes from human isolates gathered globally from 2001 to 2020 to quantify the temporal rate of acquisition of AMR genes in <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> isolates to predict the future number of drug-resistant cases and deaths that could be averted by vaccination.</p>\n",
       "<p>Resistance rates to carbapenems are increasing most rapidly and 22.43% [95th percentile Bayesian credible interval (CrI): 5.24 to 41.42] of neonatal sepsis deaths are caused by meropenem-resistant <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em>. Globally, we estimate that maternal vaccination could avert 80,258 [CrI: 18,084 to 189,040] neonatal deaths and 399,015 [CrI: 334,523 to 485,442] neonatal sepsis cases yearly worldwide, accounting for more than 3.40% [CrI: 0.75 to 8.01] of all neonatal deaths. The largest relative benefits are in Africa (Sierra Leone, Mali, Niger) and South-East Asia (Bangladesh) where vaccination could avert over 6% of all neonatal deaths. Nevertheless, our modeling only considers country-level trends in <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> neonatal sepsis deaths and is unable to consider within-country variability in bacterial prevalence that may impact the projected burden of sepsis.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>A <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> maternal vaccine could have widespread, sustained global benefits as AMR in <em>K</em>. <em>pneumoniae</em> continues to increase.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends systematic symptom screening for tuberculosis (TB). However, TB prevalence surveys suggest that this strategy does not identify millions of TB patients, globally. Undiagnosed or delayed diagnosis of TB contribute to TB transmission and exacerbate morbidity and mortality. We conducted a cluster-randomized trial of large urban and rural primary healthcare clinics in 3 provinces of South Africa to evaluate whether a novel intervention of targeted universal testing for TB (TUTT) in high-risk groups diagnosed more patients with TB per month compared to current standard of care (SoC) symptom-directed TB testing.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>Sixty-two clinics were randomized; with initiation of the intervention clinics over 6 months from March 2019. The study was prematurely stopped in March 2020 due to clinics restricting access to patients, and then a week later due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) national lockdown; by then, we had accrued a similar number of TB diagnoses to that of the power estimates and permanently stopped the trial. In intervention clinics, attendees living with HIV, those self-reporting a recent close contact with TB, or a prior episode of TB were all offered a sputum test for TB, irrespective of whether they reported symptoms of TB. We analyzed data abstracted from the national public sector laboratory database using Poisson regression models and compared the mean number of TB patients diagnosed per clinic per month between the study arms. Intervention clinics diagnosed 6,777 patients with TB, 20.7 patients with TB per clinic month (95% CI 16.7, 24.8) versus 6,750, 18.8 patients with TB per clinic month (95% CI 15.3, 22.2) in control clinics during study months. A direct comparison, adjusting for province and clinic TB case volume strata, did not show a significant difference in the number of TB cases between the 2 arms, incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.14 (95% CI 0.94, 1.38, <em>p</em> = 0.46). However, prespecified difference-in-differences analyses showed that while the rate of TB diagnoses in control clinics decreased over time, intervention clinics had a 17% relative increase in TB patients diagnosed per month compared to the prior year, interaction IRR 1.17 (95% CI 1.14, 1.19, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). Trial limitations were the premature stop due to COVID-19 lockdowns and the absence of between-arm comparisons of initiation and outcomes of TB treatment in those diagnosed with TB.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>Our trial suggests that the implementation of TUTT in these 3 groups at extreme risk of TB identified more TB patients than SoC and could assist in reducing undiagnosed TB patients in settings of high TB prevalence.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Growing evidence suggests an important contribution of airborne transmission to the overall spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in particular via smaller particles called aerosols. However, the contribution of school children to SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to assess transmission of airborne respiratory infections and the association with infection control measures in schools using a multiple-measurement approach.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We collected epidemiological (cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)), environmental (CO<sub>2</sub>, aerosol and particle concentrations), and molecular data (bioaerosol and saliva samples) over 7 weeks from January to March 2022 (Omicron wave) in 2 secondary schools (<em>n</em> = 90, average 18 students/classroom) in Switzerland. We analyzed changes in environmental and molecular characteristics between different study conditions (no intervention, mask wearing, air cleaners). Analyses of environmental changes were adjusted for different ventilation, the number of students in class, school and weekday effects. We modeled disease transmission using a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model, adjusting for absent students and community transmission.</p>\n",
       "<p>Molecular analysis of saliva (21/262 positive) and airborne samples (10/130) detected SARS-CoV-2 throughout the study (weekly average viral concentration 0.6 copies/L) and occasionally other respiratory viruses. Overall daily average CO<sub>2</sub> levels were 1,064 <em>±</em> 232 ppm (<em>±</em> standard deviation). Daily average aerosol number concentrations without interventions were 177 <em>±</em> 109 1/cm<sup>3</sup> and decreased by 69% (95% CrI 42% to 86%) with mask mandates and 39% (95% CrI 4% to 69%) with air cleaners. Compared to no intervention, the transmission risk was lower with mask mandates (adjusted odds ratio 0.19, 95% CrI 0.09 to 0.38) and comparable with air cleaners (1.00, 95% CrI 0.15 to 6.51).</p>\n",
       "<p>Study limitations include possible confounding by period as the number of susceptible students declined over time. Furthermore, airborne detection of pathogens document exposure but not necessarily transmission.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>Molecular detection of airborne and human SARS-CoV-2 indicated sustained transmission in schools. Mask mandates were associated with greater reductions in aerosol concentrations than air cleaners and with lower transmission. Our multiple-measurement approach could be used to continuously monitor transmission risk of respiratory infections and the effectiveness of infection control measures in schools and other congregate settings.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>The Eastern European country of Georgia initiated a nationwide hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination program in 2015 to address a high burden of infection. Screening for HCV infection through antibody testing was integrated into multiple existing programs, including the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP). We sought to compare the hepatitis C care cascade among patients with and without tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis in Georgia between 2015 and 2019 and to identify factors associated with loss to follow-up (LTFU) in hepatitis C care among patients with TB.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>Using national ID numbers, we merged databases of the HCV elimination program, NTP, and national death registry from January 1, 2015 to September 30, 2020. The study population included 11,985 adults (aged ≥18 years) diagnosed with active TB from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2019, and 1,849,820 adults tested for HCV antibodies between January 1, 2015 and September 30, 2020, who were not diagnosed with TB during that time. We estimated the proportion of patients with and without TB who were LTFU at each step of the HCV care cascade and explored temporal changes. Among 11,985 patients with active TB, 9,065 (76%) patients without prior hepatitis C treatment were tested for HCV antibodies, of which 1,665 (18%) had a positive result; LTFU from hepatitis C care was common, with 316 of 1,557 (20%) patients with a positive antibody test not undergoing viremia testing and 443 of 1,025 (43%) patients with viremia not starting treatment for hepatitis C. Overall, among persons with confirmed viremic HCV infection, due to LTFU at various stages of the care cascade only 28% of patients with TB had a documented cure from HCV infection, compared to 55% among patients without TB. LTFU after positive antibody testing substantially decreased in the last 3 years, from 32% among patients diagnosed with TB in 2017 to 12% among those diagnosed in 2019. After a positive HCV antibody test, patients without TB had viremia testing sooner than patients with TB (hazards ratio [HR] = 1.46, 95% confidence intervals [CI] [1.39, 1.54], <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). After a positive viremia test, patients without TB started hepatitis C treatment sooner than patients with TB (HR = 2.05, 95% CI [1.87, 2.25], <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). In the risk factor analysis adjusted for age, sex, and case definition (new versus previously treated), multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB was associated with an increased risk of LTFU after a positive HCV antibody test (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.41, 95% CI [1.12, 1.76], <em>p</em> = 0.003). The main limitation of this study was that due to the reliance on existing electronic databases, we were unable to account for the impact of all confounding factors in some of the analyses.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>LTFU from hepatitis C care after a positive antibody or viremia test was high and more common among patients with TB than in those without TB. Better integration of TB and hepatitis C care systems can potentially reduce LTFU and improve patient outcomes both in Georgia and other countries that are initiating or scaling up their nationwide hepatitis C control efforts and striving to provide personalized TB treatment.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Self-reported adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been modestly inversely associated with incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in cohort studies. There is uncertainty about the validity and magnitude of this association due to subjective reporting of diet. The association has not been evaluated using an objectively measured biomarker of the Mediterranean diet.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We derived a biomarker score based on 5 circulating carotenoids and 24 fatty acids that discriminated between the Mediterranean or habitual diet arms of a parallel design, 6-month partial-feeding randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted between 2013 and 2014, the MedLey trial (128 participants out of 166 randomised). We applied this biomarker score in an observational study, the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-InterAct case-cohort study, to assess the association of the score with T2D incidence over an average of 9.7 years of follow-up since the baseline (1991 to 1998). We included 22,202 participants, of whom 9,453 were T2D cases, with relevant biomarkers from an original case-cohort of 27,779 participants sampled from a cohort of 340,234 people. As a secondary measure of the Mediterranean diet, we used a score estimated from dietary-self report. Within the trial, the biomarker score discriminated well between the 2 arms; the cross-validated C-statistic was 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 0.94). The score was inversely associated with incident T2D in EPIC-InterAct: the hazard ratio (HR) per standard deviation of the score was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.65 to 0.77) following adjustment for sociodemographic, lifestyle and medical factors, and adiposity. In comparison, the HR per standard deviation of the self-reported Mediterranean diet was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.86 to 0.95). Assuming the score was causally associated with T2D, higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet in Western European adults by 10 percentiles of the score was estimated to reduce the incidence of T2D by 11% (95% CI: 7% to 14%). The study limitations included potential measurement error in nutritional biomarkers, unclear specificity of the biomarker score to the Mediterranean diet, and possible residual confounding.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>These findings suggest that objectively assessed adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with lower risk of T2D and that even modestly higher adherence may have the potential to reduce the population burden of T2D meaningfully.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Home working has increased since the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic’s onset with concerns that it may have adverse health implications. We assessed the association between home working and social and mental wellbeing among the employed population aged 16 to 66 through harmonised analyses of 7 UK longitudinal studies.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We estimated associations between home working and measures of psychological distress, low life satisfaction, poor self-rated health, low social contact, and loneliness across 3 different stages of the pandemic (T1 = April to June 2020 –first lockdown, T2 = July to October 2020 –eased restrictions, T3 = November 2020 to March 2021 –second lockdown) using modified Poisson regression and meta-analyses to pool results across studies. We successively adjusted the model for sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex), job characteristics (e.g., sector of activity, pre-pandemic home working propensities), and pre-pandemic health. Among respectively 10,367, 11,585, and 12,179 participants at T1, T2, and T3, we found higher rates of home working at T1 and T3 compared with T2, reflecting lockdown periods. Home working was not associated with psychological distress at T1 (RR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.79 to 1.08) or T2 (RR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.88 to 1.11), but a detrimental association was found with psychological distress at T3 (RR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.30). Study limitations include the fact that pre-pandemic home working propensities were derived from external sources, no information was collected on home working dosage and possible reverse association between change in wellbeing and home working likelihood.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>No clear evidence of an association between home working and mental wellbeing was found, apart from greater risk of psychological distress during the second lockdown, but differences across subgroups (e.g., by sex or level of education) may exist. Longer term shifts to home working might not have adverse impacts on population wellbeing in the absence of pandemic restrictions but further monitoring of health inequalities is required.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>While the United Kingdom National Health Service aimed to reduce social inequalities in the provision of joint replacement, it is unclear whether these gaps have reduced. We describe secular trends in the provision of primary hip and knee replacement surgery between social deprivation groups.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We used the National Joint Registry to identify all hip and knee replacements performed for osteoarthritis from 2007 to 2017 in England. The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2015 was used to identify the relative level of deprivation of the patient living area. Multilevel negative binomial regression models were used to model the differences in rates of joint replacement. Choropleth maps of hip and knee replacement provision were produced to identify the geographical variation in provision by Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs).</p>\n",
       "<p>A total of 675,342 primary hip and 834,146 primary knee replacements were studied. The mean age was 70 years old (standard deviation: 9) with 60% and 56% of women undergoing hip and knee replacements, respectively. The overall rate of hip replacement increased from 27 to 36 per 10,000 person-years and knee replacement from 33 to 46. Inequalities of provision between the most (reference) and least affluent areas have remained constant for both joints (hip: rate ratio (RR) = 0.58, 95% confidence interval [0.56, 0.60] in 2007, RR = 0.59 [0.58, 0.61] in 2017; knee: RR = 0.82 [0.80, 0.85] in 2007, RR = 0.81 [0.80, 0.83] in 2017). For hip replacement, CCGs with the highest concentration of deprived areas had lower overall provision rates, and CCGs with very few deprived areas had higher provision rates. There was no clear pattern of provision inequalities between CCGs and deprivation concentration for knee replacement.</p>\n",
       "<p>Study limitations include the lack of publicly available information to explore these inequalities beyond age, sex, and geographical area. Information on clinical need for surgery or patient willingness to access care were unavailable.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>In this study, we found that there were inequalities, which remained constant over time, especially in the provision of hip replacement, by degree of social deprivation. Providers of healthcare need to take action to reduce this unwarranted variation in provision of surgery.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>There remains uncertainty about the impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on mental health. This umbrella review provides a comprehensive overview of the association between the pandemic and common mental disorders. We qualitatively summarized evidence from reviews with meta-analyses of individual study-data in the general population, healthcare workers, and specific at-risk populations.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>A systematic search was carried out in 5 databases for peer-reviewed systematic reviews with meta-analyses of prevalence of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms during the pandemic published between December 31, 2019 until August 12, 2022. We identified 123 reviews of which 7 provided standardized mean differences (SMDs) either from longitudinal pre- to during pandemic study-data or from cross-sectional study-data compared to matched pre-pandemic data. Methodological quality rated with the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews checklist scores (AMSTAR 2) instrument was generally low to moderate. Small but significant increases of depression, anxiety, and/or general mental health symptoms were reported in the general population, in people with preexisting physical health conditions, and in children (3 reviews; SMDs ranged from 0.11 to 0.28). Mental health and depression symptoms significantly increased during periods of social restrictions (1 review; SMDs of 0.41 and 0.83, respectively) but anxiety symptoms did not (SMD: 0.26). Increases of depression symptoms were generally larger and longer-lasting during the pandemic (3 reviews; SMDs depression ranged from 0.16 to 0.23) than those of anxiety (2 reviews: SMDs 0.12 and 0.18). Females showed a significantly larger increase in anxiety symptoms than males (1 review: SMD 0.15). In healthcare workers, people with preexisting mental disorders, any patient group, children and adolescents, and in students, no significant differences from pre- to during pandemic were found (2 reviews; SMD’s ranging from −0.16 to 0.48). In 116 reviews pooled cross-sectional prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms ranged from 9% to 48% across populations. Although heterogeneity between studies was high and largely unexplained, assessment tools and cut-offs used, age, sex or gender, and COVID-19 exposure factors were found to be moderators in some reviews. The major limitations are the inability to quantify and explain the high heterogeneity across reviews included and the shortage of within-person data from multiple longitudinal studies.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>A small but consistent deterioration of mental health and particularly depression during early pandemic and during social restrictions has been found in the general population and in people with chronic somatic disorders. Also, associations between mental health and the pandemic were stronger in females and younger age groups than in others. Explanatory individual-level, COVID-19 exposure, and time-course factors were scarce and showed inconsistencies across reviews. For policy and research, repeated assessments of mental health in population panels including vulnerable individuals are recommended to respond to current and future health crises.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Why was this study done?</h3>\n",
       "<p>The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been one of the greatest global public health challenges of the last century and has impacted multiple aspects of health and public life.</p>\n",
       "<p>An adverse association between the pandemic and global mental health was expected and many research projects have been rapidly developed to assess this.</p>\n",
       "<p>There is uncertainty about the degree and extent of the associations between the pandemic and its associated measures and mental health.</p>\n",
       "<h3>What do these findings mean?</h3>\n",
       "<p>This umbrella review could help clinicians, researchers, and policy makers to better understand the current evidence on the association between the COVID-19 pandemic and mental health, particularly in specific vulnerable subpopulations.</p>\n",
       "<p>The interpretability of the included systematic reviews was limited by the great variation in prevalence rates and associations between studies and because of the scarcity of longitudinal data.</p>\n",
       "<p>Policy makers and researchers should address common pitfalls of research designs prior to implementation of systematic mental health assessments in future population panels.</p>\n",
       "<h3>What did the researchers do and find?</h3>\n",
       "<p>We synthesized evidence from 123 systematic reviews of individual studies on symptoms of common mental disorders, including depression, anxiety, and PTSD, in general and specific populations and in healthcare workers. Seven reviews compared differences in mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic or during implementation of public health and social measures to pre-pandemic periods or periods with minimal restrictions. Another 116 reviews provided combined data on during pandemic prevalence rates of mental health outcomes.</p>\n",
       "<p>Mental health and particularly mood of the general population slightly deteriorated in the first half year of the pandemic, and symptom increases were associated with periods of public health measures and social restrictions. Also, people with preexisting physical health conditions, females, and young people showed pandemic-associated increases in symptoms.</p>\n",
       "<p>Variation in pandemic-associated mental health prevalence rates between individual studies was large and often unexplained. In several reviews, methodological, individual-level, and COVID-19 exposure factors did explain some of the variation but in others this was not the case. Quality of the systematic reviews was poor to moderate.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is associated with a suboptimal intrauterine environment, which may adversely impact fetal neurodevelopment. However, analysing neurodevelopmental outcomes by observed birthweight fails to differentiate between true FGR and constitutionally small infants and cannot account for iatrogenic intervention. This study aimed to determine the relationship between antenatal FGR and mid-childhood (age 5 to 7 years) educational outcomes.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>The Pregnancy Outcome Prediction Study (2008–2012) was a prospective birth cohort conducted in a single maternity hospital in Cambridge, United Kingdom. Clinicians were blinded to the antenatal diagnosis of FGR. FGR was defined as estimated fetal weight (EFW) &lt;10th percentile at approximately 36 weeks of gestation, plus one or more indicators of placental dysfunction, including ultrasonic markers and maternal serum levels of placental biomarkers. A total of 2,754 children delivered at term were divided into 4 groups: FGR, appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) with markers of placental dysfunction, healthy small-for-gestational age (SGA), and healthy AGA (referent). Educational outcomes (assessed at 5 to 7 years using UK national standards) were assessed with respect to FGR status using regression models adjusted for relevant covariates, including maternal, pregnancy, and socioeconomic factors.</p>\n",
       "<p>Compared to healthy AGA (<em>N =</em> 1,429), children with FGR (<em>N</em> = 250) were at higher risk of “below national standard” educational performance at 6 years (18% versus 11%; aOR 1.68; 95% CI 1.12 to 2.48, <em>p</em> = 0.01). By age 7, children with FGR were more likely to perform below standard in reading (21% versus 15%; aOR 1.46; 95% CI 0.99 to 2.13, <em>p</em> = 0.05), writing (28% versus 23%; aOR 1.46; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.07, <em>p</em> = 0.04), and mathematics (24% versus 16%; aOR 1.49; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.15, <em>p</em> = 0.03). This was consistent whether FGR was defined by ultrasound or biochemical markers. The educational attainment of healthy SGA children (<em>N =</em> 126) was comparable to healthy AGA, although this comparison may be underpowered. Our study design relied on linkage of routinely collected educational data according to nationally standardised metrics; this design allowed a high percentage of eligible participants to be included in the analysis (75%) but excludes those children educated outside of government-funded schools in the UK. Our focus on pragmatic and validated measures of educational attainment does not exclude more subtle effects of the intrauterine environment on specific aspects of neurodevelopment.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>Compared to children with normal fetal growth and no markers of placental dysfunction, FGR is associated with poorer educational attainment in mid-childhood.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Some studies have identified declines in mental health during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in different age groups, including older people. As anxiety and depression are common neuropsychiatric symptoms among people with cognitive impairment, the mental health experiences of older people during the pandemic should take cognitive function into consideration, along with assessments made prior to the pandemic. This study addresses evidence gaps to test whether changes in depression and anxiety among older people through the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with cognitive impairment. It also investigates whether associations varied according to key sources of sociodemographic inequality.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>Using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) collected from 2018/2019 to November/December 2020, we estimated changes in depression and anxiety for people aged 50+ in England across 3 cognitive function groups: no impairment, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. Conditional growth curve models were estimated for continuous measures over 3 time points (<em>N =</em> 5,286), with mixed-effects logistic regression used for binary measures. All models adjusted for demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, and cohabiting partnership), socioeconomics (education, wealth, and employment status), geography (urban/rural and English region), and health (self-rated and the presence of multimorbidity).</p>\n",
       "<p>We found that depression (measured with CES-D score) worsened from 2018/2019 to November/December 2020 for people with mild cognitive impairment (1.39 (95% CI: 1.29 to 1.49) to 2.16 (2.02 to 2.30)) or no impairment (1.17 (95%CI: 1.12 to 1.22) to 2.03 (1.96 to 2.10)). Anxiety, using a single-item rating of 0 to 10 also worsened among those with mild cognitive impairment (2.48 (2.30 to 2.66) to 3.14 (2.95 to 3.33)) or no impairment (2.20 (2.11 to 2.28) to 2.85 (2.77 to 2.95)). No statistically significant increases were found for those with dementia. Using a clinical cutoff for likely depression (CES-D ≥4), we found statistically significant increases in the probability of depression between 2018/2019 and November/December 2020 for those with no impairment (0.110 (0.099 to 0.120) to 0.206 (0.191 to 0.222)) and mild impairment (0.139 (0.120 to 0.159) to 0.234 (0.204 to 0.263)).</p>\n",
       "<p>We also found that differences according to cognitive function that existed before the pandemic were no longer present by June/July 2020, and there were no statistically significant differences in depression or anxiety among cognitive groups in November/December 2020. Wealth and education appeared to be stronger drivers for depression and anxiety, respectively, than cognitive impairment. For example, those with no impairment in the richest two-thirds scored 1.76 (1.69 to 1.82) for depression in June/July, compared to 2.01 (1.91 to 2.12) for those with no impairment in the poorest third and 2.03 (1.87 to 2.19) for those with impairment in the poorest third. Results may be limited by the small number of people with dementia and are generalizable only to people living in the community, not to those in institutional care settings.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>Our findings suggest a convergence in mental health across cognitive function groups during the pandemic. This suggests mental health services will need to meet an increased demand from older adults, especially those not living with cognitive impairment. Further, with little significant change among those with dementia, their existing need for support will remain; policymakers and care practitioners should ensure this group continues to have equitable access to mental health support.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>The growing population of adolescents and young people (AYP) aged 15 to 24 in sub-Saharan Africa face a high burden of HIV in many settings. Unintended pregnancies among adolescent girls in the region remain high. Nonetheless, the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) service needs of AYP have remained underserved. We conducted a cluster-randomised trial (CRT) to estimate the impact of community-based, peer-led SRH service provision on knowledge of HIV status and other SRH outcomes, including met need for contraceptives.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>Yathu Yathu was a cluster-randomised trial (CRT) conducted from 2019 to 2021 in 2 urban communities in Lusaka, Zambia. The communities were divided into 20 zones (approximately 2,350 AYP/zone) that were randomly allocated to the Yathu Yathu intervention or control arm. In each intervention zone, a community-based hub, staffed by peer support workers, was established to provide SRH services. In 2019, a census was conducted in all zones; all consenting AYP aged 15 to 24 were given a Yathu Yathu card, which allowed them to accrue points for accessing SRH services at the hub and health facility (intervention arm) or the health facility only (control arm). Points could be exchanged for rewards, thus acting as an incentive to use SRH services in both arms. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 2021 to estimate the impact of Yathu Yathu on the primary outcome: knowledge of HIV status (self-reporting living with HIV or HIV testing in the last 12 months) and secondary outcomes, including use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in the last 12 months, current use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and met need for contraceptive services. The sampling was stratified on sex and age group, and we analysed data at cluster-level using a two-stage process recommended for CRTs with &lt;15 clusters/arm. A total of 1,989 AYP consented to participate in the survey (50% male); consent was similar across arms (63% consent/arm). Across zones, knowledge of HIV status ranged from 63.6% to 81.2% in intervention zones and 35.4% to 63.0% in control zones. Adjusting for age, sex, and community, knowledge of HIV status was higher in the intervention arm compared to control (73.3% versus 48.4%, respectively, adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) 1.53 95% CI 1.36, 1.72; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). By age and sex, results were similar. There was no evidence for impact on any secondary outcomes, including current use of ART and met need for contraceptives. There were no adverse events reported in either arm. A key limitation of our trial is that approximately 35% of the AYP randomly selected for participation in the endline survey could not be reached.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>Delivering community-based, peer-led SRH services increased knowledge of HIV status among AYP, both males and females, compared with the control arm. Scaling up the highly effective Yathu Yathu strategy has the potential to make a substantial contribution to increasing access to HIV prevention and care services for young people. However, additional implementation research is needed to understand how to improve uptake of broader SRH services, beyond uptake of HIV testing.</p>\n",

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>In low- and middle-income countries (L&amp;MICs), the biggest contributing factors to the global burden of disease in childhood are deaths due to respiratory illness and diarrhoea, both of which are closely related to use of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services by households. However, current estimates of the health impacts of WASH interventions use self-reported morbidity, which may fail to capture longer-term or more severe impacts. Reported mortality is thought to be less prone to bias than other reported measures. This study aimed to answer the question: What are the impacts of WASH interventions on reported childhood mortality in L&amp;MICs?</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, using a published protocol. Systematic searches of 11 academic databases and trial registries, plus organisational repositories, were undertaken to locate studies of WASH interventions, which were published in peer review journals or other sources (e.g., organisational reports and working papers). Intervention studies of WASH improvements implemented under endemic disease circumstances in L&amp;MICs were eligible, which reported findings at any time until March 2020. We used the participant flow data supplied in response to journal editors’ calls for greater transparency. Data were collected by two authors working independently.</p>\n",
       "<p>We included evidence from 24 randomized and 11 nonrandomized studies of WASH interventions from all global regions, incorporating 2,600 deaths. Effects of 48 WASH treatment arms were included in analysis. We critically appraised and synthesised evidence using meta-analysis to improve statistical power. We found WASH interventions are associated with a significant reduction of 17% in the odds of all-cause mortality in childhood (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.74, 0.92, evidence from 38 interventions), and a significant reduction in diarrhoea mortality of 45% (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.35, 0.84; 10 interventions).</p>\n",
       "<p>Further analysis by WASH technology indicated interventions providing improved water in quantity to households were most consistently associated with reductions in all-cause mortality. Community-wide sanitation was most consistently associated with reductions in diarrhoea mortality. Around one-half of the included studies were assessed as being at “moderate risk of bias” in attributing mortality in childhood to the WASH intervention, and no studies were found to be at “low risk of bias.” The review should be updated to incorporate additional published and unpublished participant flow data.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>The findings are congruent with theories of infectious disease transmission. Washing with water presents a barrier to respiratory illness and diarrhoea, which are the two biggest contributors to all-cause mortality in childhood in L&amp;MICs. Community-wide sanitation halts the spread of diarrhoea. We observed that evidence synthesis can provide new findings, going beyond the underlying data from trials to generate crucial insights for policy. Transparent reporting in trials creates opportunities for research synthesis to answer questions about mortality, which individual studies of interventions cannot be reliably designed to address.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Antihypertensives are effective at reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, but limited data exist quantifying their association with serious adverse events, particularly in older people with frailty. This study aimed to examine this association using nationally representative electronic health record data.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods and findings</h3>\n",
       "<p>This was a retrospective cohort study utilising linked data from 1,256 general practices across England held within the Clinical Practice Research Datalink between 1998 and 2018. Included patients were aged 40+ years, with a systolic blood pressure reading between 130 and 179 mm Hg, and not previously prescribed antihypertensive treatment. The main exposure was defined as a first prescription of antihypertensive treatment. The primary outcome was hospitalisation or death within 10 years from falls. Secondary outcomes were hypotension, syncope, fractures, acute kidney injury, electrolyte abnormalities, and primary care attendance with gout. The association between treatment and these serious adverse events was examined by Cox regression adjusted for propensity score. This propensity score was generated from a multivariable logistic regression model with patient characteristics, medical history and medication prescriptions as covariates, and new antihypertensive treatment as the outcome. Subgroup analyses were undertaken by age and frailty. Of 3,834,056 patients followed for a median of 7.1 years, 484,187 (12.6%) were prescribed new antihypertensive treatment in the 12 months before the index date (baseline). Antihypertensives were associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation or death from falls (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21 to 1.26), hypotension (aHR 1.32, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.35), syncope (aHR 1.20, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.22), acute kidney injury (aHR 1.44, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.47), electrolyte abnormalities (aHR 1.45, 95% CI 1.43 to 1.48), and primary care attendance with gout (aHR 1.35, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.37). The absolute risk of serious adverse events with treatment was very low, with 6 fall events per 10,000 patients treated per year. In older patients (80 to 89 years) and those with severe frailty, this absolute risk was increased, with 61 and 84 fall events per 10,000 patients treated per year (respectively). Findings were consistent in sensitivity analyses using different approaches to address confounding and taking into account the competing risk of death. A strength of this analysis is that it provides evidence regarding the association between antihypertensive treatment and serious adverse events, in a population of patients more representative than those enrolled in previous randomised controlled trials. Although treatment effect estimates fell within the 95% CIs of those from such trials, these analyses were observational in nature and so bias from unmeasured confounding cannot be ruled out.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>Antihypertensive treatment was associated with serious adverse events. Overall, the absolute risk of this harm was low, with the exception of older patients and those with moderate to severe frailty, where the risks were similar to the likelihood of benefit from treatment. In these populations, physicians may want to consider alternative approaches to management of blood pressure and refrain from prescribing new treatment.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n",
       "<p>Among individuals ≥ 65 years old, aortic stenosis is highly prevalent and the number of cases is expected to increase in the coming decades, due to the increased life expectancy. Nevertheless, the actual aortic stenosis burden is not well known in population settings and the impact of aortic stenosis on quality of life has not been studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate aortic stenosis impact on health-related quality of life in patients &gt; 65 years old.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods</h3>\n",
       "<p>An epidemiological case-control study was carried out to compare quality of life in patients ≥65 years old with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Demographical and clinical information was prospectively obtained and quality of life information was collected with the Short Form Health Survey_v2 (SF-12) questionnaire. The association between quality of life and aortic stenosis was determined using multiple logistic regression models.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Results</h3>\n",
       "<p>Patients with severe aortic stenosis self-perceived worse quality of life on all dimensions and summary components of the SF-12 questionnaire. In the final multiple logistic regression model a significant inverse association was observed between the dimensions ‘physical role’ and ‘social role’ (p = 0.002 and p = 0.005) and an association close to significance with ‘physical role’ (p = 0.052) of the SF-12 questionnaire.</p>\n",

       "<p>Sickleweed (<em>Falcaria vulgaris</em>) is the name of a species of annual, and perennial herbaceous plants of the genus <em>Falcaria</em>. Climate change could negatively influnces the performance of various plant species in plant kingdom. In this study, 15 different sickleweed populations from seven provinces of the country were collected based on an unbalanced nest design with 10 replications and the percentage of essential oil, types of chlorophyll, phenol, proline, protein, and carotenoids were measured on them. The results showed that there was a significant difference between populations at the level of one percent for the studied traits. The results of the mean comparison showed that populations Ard-Shaban and Qaz-Ilan in terms of the evaluated traits and especially the percentage of essential oil were at the upper of the studied samples and selected as suitable populations. In addition, populations Gilan-Deylaman and Kur-Gerger-e Sofla were also identified as superior populations in terms of studied traits by cluster analysis and principle component analysis (PCA). Since the high level of proline and biochemical and physiological traits in plants can play a role in plants’ tolerance to stresses, therefore, populations with high values of these traits can be used in stress tolerance breeding programs. Therefore, in this study, populations Gilan-Deylaman and Kur-Gerger-e Sofla can be suitable populations for this purpose. In addition, the essential oil of this plant is used in the treatment of diseases, and therefore populations Ard-Shaban and Qaz-Ilan, which showed a high percentage of essential oil, can be used in breeding programs to increase the performance of this trait.</p>\n",

       "<p>Patients with mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be treated with a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC). The use of the respiratory rate-oxygenation (ROX) index, calculated as the ratio of oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>)/fractional oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) to respiratory rate, in the first few hours after HFNC initiation can help identify patients who fail HFNC therapy later. However, few studies have documented the use of the ROX index during the period of HFNC therapy. Therefore, we aimed to demonstrate the diagnostic performance of the ROX index when calculated throughout the HFNC therapy period and to determine the best cut-off point for predicting HFNC failure. We conducted a retrospective study of patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS who commenced HFNC at the Faculty of Medicine Vajira Hospital, Navamindradhiraj University, Thailand, between April 1 and August 30, 2021. We calculated the ROX index every 4 h throughout the HFNC therapy period and defined HFNC failure as a subsequent endotracheal tube intubation. The performance of the ROX index was analyzed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We applied the ROX index ≤ 4.88 to predict HFNC failure and obtained a new ROX cut-off point using Youden’s method. In total, 212 patients with COVID-19 treated with HFNC were included in the study. Of these, 81 patients (38.2%) experienced HFNC failure. The ROX index ≤ 4.88 demonstrated a reasonable performance in predicting HFNC failure (AUC, 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72–0.83; p&lt;0.001). However, compared with the original cut-off point of ≤ 4.88, the new ROX index cut-off point of ≤ 5.84 delivered optimal performance (AUC, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.79–0.88; p&lt;0.001), with a significantly better discriminative ability (p = 0.007). In conclusion, a ROX index ≤ 5.84 was found to be optimal for predicting HFNC failure in patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS.</p>\n",

       "<p>In heterogeneous catalytic processes, immobilization of the functional material over a proper support is a vital solution for reusing and/or avoiding a secondary pollution problem. The study introduces a novel approach for immobilizing R25 NPs on the surface of silica granules using hydrothermal treatment followed by calcination process. Due to the privileged characteristics of the subcritical water, during the hydrothermal treatment process, the utilized R25 NPs were partially dissolved and precipitated on the surface of the silica granules. Calcination at high temperature (700°C) resulted in improving the attachment forces. The structure of the newly proposed composite was approved by 2D and 3D optical microscope images, XRD and EDX analyses. The functionalized silica granules were used in the form of a packed bed for continuous removal of methylene blue dye. The results indicated that the TiO<sub>2</sub>:sand ratio has a considerable effect on the shape of the dye removal breakthrough curve as the exhaustion point, corresponding to ~ 95% removal, was 12.3, 17.4 and 21.3 min for 1:20, 1:10 and 1:5 metal oxides ratio, respectively. Furthermore, the modified silica granules could be exploited as a photocatalyst for hydrogen generation from sewage wastewaters under direct sunlight with a good rate; 75×10<sup>−3</sup> mmol/s. Interestingly, after the ease separation of the used granules, the performance was not affected. Based on the obtained results, the 170°C is the optimum hydrothermal treatment temperature. Overall, the study opens a new avenue for immobilization of functional semiconductors on the surface of sand granules.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>Epidemics have historically been accompanied by stigma and discrimination. Disease-related stigma has often been shown to have severe consequences for physical, mental and social wellbeing and lead to barriers to diagnosis, treatment and prevention. The aims of this study were to investigate if a HIV-related stigma measure could be adapted and valid and reliable to measure COVID-19-related stigma, and also to investigate levels of self-reported stigma and related factors among people in Sweden with experience of COVID-19 and compare levels of COVID-19-related stigma versus HIV-related stigma among persons living with HIV who had experienced a COVID-19 event.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods</h3>\n",
       "<p>Cognitive interviews (n = 11) and cross-sectional surveys were made after the acute phase of the illness using a new 12-item COVID-19 Stigma Scale and the established 12-item HIV Stigma Scale in two cohorts (people who had experienced COVID-19 (n = 166/209, 79%) and people living with HIV who had experienced a COVID-19 event (n = 50/91, 55%). Psychometric analysis of the COVID-19 Stigma Scale was performed by calculating floor and ceiling effects, Cronbach’s α and exploratory factor analysis. Levels of COVID-19 stigma between groups were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Levels of COVID-19 and HIV stigma among people living with HIV with a COVID-19 event were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Results</h3>\n",
       "<p>The COVID-19 cohort consisted of 88 (53%) men and 78 (47%) women, mean age 51 (19–80); 143 (87%) living in a higher and 22 (13%) in a lower income area. The HIV + COVID-19 cohort consisted of 34 (68%) men and 16 (32%) women, mean age 51 (26–79); 20 (40%) living in a higher and 30 (60%) in a lower income area. The cognitive interviews showed that the stigma items were easy to understand. Factor analysis suggested a four-factor solution accounting for 77% of the total variance. There were no cross loadings, but two items loaded on factors differing from the original scale. All subscales had acceptable internal consistency, showed high floor and no ceiling effects. There was no statistically significant difference between COVID-19 stigma scores between the two cohorts or between genders. People living in lower income areas reported more negative self-image and concerns about public attitudes related to COVID-19 than people in higher income areas (median score 3 vs 3 and 4 vs 3 on a scale from 3–12, Z = -1.980, <em>p</em> = 0.048 and Z = -2.023, <em>p</em> = 0.024, respectively). People from the HIV + COVID-19 cohort reported more HIV than COVID-19 stigma.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n",
       "<p>The adapted 12-item COVID-19 Stigma Scale may be valid and reliable for measurement of COVID-19-related stigma. However, specific items may need to be rephrased or replaced to better correspond to the COVID-19 context. People who had experienced COVID-19 reported low levels of COVID-19-related stigma in general but people from lower income areas had higher levels of negative self-image and concerns about public attitudes related to COVID-19 than people from areas with higher income, which may call for targeted interventions. Although exhibiting more pronounced HIV stigma levels, people living with HIV who had experienced COVID-19 reported COVID-19-related stigma of the same low magnitude as their peers not living with HIV.</p>\n",

       "<p>Enterotoxigenic <em>Escherichia coli</em> (ETEC) is a diarrhoeal pathogen associated with high morbidity and mortality especially among young children in developing countries. At present, there is no vaccine for ETEC. One candidate vaccine antigen, EtpA, is a conserved secreted adhesin that binds to the tips of flagellae to bridge ETEC to host intestinal glycans. EtpA is exported through a Gram-negative, two-partner secretion system (TPSS, type Vb) comprised of the secreted EtpA passenger (TpsA) protein and EtpB (TpsB) transporter that is integrated into the outer bacterial membrane. TpsA proteins share a conserved, N-terminal TPS domain followed by an extensive C-terminal domain with divergent sequence repeats. Two soluble, N-terminal constructs of EtpA were prepared and analysed respectively including residues 67 to 447 (EtpA<sup>67-447</sup>) and 1 to 606 (EtpA<sup>1-606</sup>). The crystal structure of EtpA<sup>67-447</sup> solved at 1.76 Å resolution revealed a right-handed parallel β-helix with two extra-helical hairpins and an N-terminal β-strand cap. Analyses by circular dichroism spectroscopy confirmed the β-helical fold and indicated high resistance to chemical and thermal denaturation as well as rapid refolding. A theoretical AlphaFold model of full-length EtpA largely concurs with the crystal structure adding an extended β-helical C-terminal domain after an interdomain kink. We propose that robust folding of the TPS domain upon secretion provides a template to extend the N-terminal β-helix into the C-terminal domains of TpsA proteins.</p>\n",

       "<p>Despite the reduction of death from pneumonia over recent years, pneumonia has still been the leading infectious cause of death in under-five children for the last several decades. Unconsciousness is a critical condition in any child resulting from any illness. Once it occurs during a pneumonia episode, the outcome is perceived to be fatal. However, data on children under five with pneumonia having unconsciousness are scarce. We’ve retrospectively analyzed the data of under-five children admitted at the in-patient ward of Dhaka Hospital of icddr,b during 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2017 with World Health Organization classified pneumonia or severe pneumonia. Children presented with or without unconsciousness were considered as cases and controls respectively. Among a total of 3,876 children fulfilling the inclusion criteria, 325 and 3,551 were the cases and the controls respectively. A multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed older children (8 months vs. 7.9 months) (adjusted odds ratio, aOR 1.02, 95% CI: 1.004–1.04, p = 0.015), hypoxemia (aOR 3.22, 95% CI: 2.39–4.34, p&lt;0.001), severe sepsis (aOR 4.46, 95% CI: 3.28–6.06, p&lt;0.001), convulsion (aOR 8.90, 95% CI: 6.72–11.79, p&lt;0.001), and dehydration (aOR 2.08, 95% CI: 1.56–2.76, p&lt;0.001) were found to be independently associated with the cases. The cases more often had a fatal outcome than the controls (23% vs. 3%, OR 9.56, 95% CI: 6.95–13.19, p&lt;0.001). If the simple predicting factors of unconsciousness in children under five hospitalized for pneumonia with different severity can be initially identified and adequately treated with prompt response, pneumonia-related deaths can be reduced more effectively, especially in resource-limited settings.</p>\n",

       "<p>Childhood trauma and adverse childhood experiences have a strong relationship with health disparities across the lifespan. Despite experiencing approximately doubled rates of trauma, Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are poorly characterized in deaf populations. We sought to characterize deaf-specific demographic factors and their association with multiple experiences of ACEs before the age of 18 years old. An analytical cross-sectional approach was used to ascertain associations of deaf-specific demographic factors and experiences with ACEs. The complete dataset included 520 participants for a total response rate of 56%. After adjusting for confounding effects, less severe hearing loss of 16–55 dB (2+ OR: 5.2, 4+ OR: 4.7), having a cochlear implant (2+ OR: 2.1, 4+ OR: 2.6), and not attending at least one school with signing access (2+ OR: 2.4, 4+ OR: 3.7) were significantly and independently associated with reported experiences of multiple ACEs. We conclude that factors associated with childhood hearing loss and language experiences increase risk of experiencing ACEs. Given the strong relationship between ACEs and poor social outcomes, early intervention clinical practice and health policies should consider interventions to support healthy home environments for deaf children.</p>\n",

       "<p>The waters off Sanriku (located on the northeastern coast of Honshu Island, Japan) provide the southernmost habitats of northern fur seals (<em>Callorhinus ursinus</em>) during winter and spring in the western North Pacific. The southward flowing cold Oyashio current and northward-flowing warm Kuroshio extension mix there, making the area highly productive. Northern fur seals migrate into these waters from the breeding rookeries for feeding, and the locations of the southern margins of their habitats vary yearly. The key questions for understanding the seasonal migration patterns are “why” and “how” the species utilize these waters as the southernmost habitat. We estimated the density and abundance of northern fur seals using standard line-transect theory combined with habitat modeling. The spatial patterns of animal density were analyzed using generalized additive models with seven static and dynamic environmental covariates, and those covariates were selected based on Akaike’s information criterion (AIC). The lowest AIC model included depth, sea surface temperature, slope, and gradient in sea surface temperature. This model estimated well the spatial patterns of the density of the species, in which fur seals were widely distributed in the study areas, but less frequently encountered between the isobaths 100 m and 200 m. These spatially separated habitats suggest that the shelf break and offshore front play an important role in creating the feeding grounds of fur seals. On the other hand, sea surface temperature positively correlated with fur seals’ density up to 14°C. This may indicate that further warm waters work as a temperature barrier, and fur seals concentrate on the edge of suitable temperature ranges.</p>\n",

       "<p>Fatty acids (FA) in follicular fluid (FF) are present in an esterified form [triglycerides, cholesterol esters and phospholipids] or as non-esterified FA, which partly originate from blood. However, a comprehensive comparison of blood vs. FF FA in various lipid classes is missing. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of the FA composition in each lipid class of serum and FF, and to investigate their mutual correlations. A total of 74 patients undergoing assisted reproductive technology treatment were involved in the study. Both in serum as well as FF, saturated FA and mono-unsaturated FA were predominant in non-esterified FA and triglycerides fractions while poly-unsaturated FA were mainly present in phospholipids and cholesterol esters fractions, although phospholipids also contained high proportions of saturated FA. Irrespective of the lipid class, the FA proportions differed between serum and FF (<em>P</em> &lt; 0.05). Despite these differences, most of the FA in triglycerides, phospholipids and cholesterol esters of FF were well correlated with their proportions in serum. Nevertheless, only weak to moderate associations (r &lt; 0.60) were observed for the majority of the FA in the non-esterified FA fraction. Differences in FA product/precursor-ratios were found between serum and FF, such as higher C20:4n-6 to C18:2n-6 and C20:5n-3 to C18:3n-3 in FF. FA metabolism (e.g. desaturation and elongation) takes place in cells of the intrafollicular micro-environment. Moreover, good correlations between esterified FA in serum and FF suggest esterified FA in blood could be representative of esterified FA in FF.</p>\n",

       "<p>Elucidating the adaptations that promote flight in animals can aid the understanding of evolution and species divergence, and/or provide inspiration for aerospace engineering and the design of better aerial vehicles. The famed long-distance migration of monarch butterflies in North America still holds many questions and opportunities for inspiration. For example, there is little research on whether the monarch’s primary wing colors themselves (black, orange, or white) have any aerodynamic or migration function. Dark colors on wings of other animals have recently been shown to aid flight by enhancing solar absorption, which reduces drag forces. However, too much black surface could be problematic for monarchs, which are exposed to increasing amounts of solar energy along their flightpath. This paper describes the results of two related investigations that attempt to elucidate the importance of wing color to the monarch migration. By measuring the color proportions of nearly 400 monarch wings collected at different stages of their journey, we found, surprisingly, that successful migrants tended to have less black on their wings (about 3% less), but also more white pigment (about 3% more); monarchs have a band of light-colored marginal wing spots. Second, image analysis of museum specimens revealed migratory monarchs had significantly larger white spots, proportional to the wing area, than most non-migratory, New World Danaid butterflies, which argues spot size has evolved along with migratory behavior. Combined, these findings strongly suggest that the long-distance migration itself selects for larger white spots every fall, so that only those individuals with large spots will survive to pass on their genes. Further experimental work is needed to elucidate how the spots aid the migration, but it is possible that they enhance aerodynamic efficiency; other work by the authors demonstrates how alternating white and black pigment on wings can reduce drag.

       "<p>Past research has stressed the role of age and generation in climate change discourse, worries, and willingness to act. Therefore, the present paper aimed to examine the role of chronological age (as an arbitrary factor, which represents ageism) in lay people’s climate change-related attitudes, feelings, and behavioral intentions. Two experiments in different countries, Australia and Israel, were conducted for this purpose. The first study examined the impact of the age of the speaker, who provides information about the climate crisis and the second examined the impact of the age of the group being blamed for the situation. Outcome variables included perceived responsibility and motivation for the current climate situation in study 1 and perceived climate change-related attitudes, feelings, and behavioral intentions in study 2. In study 1 (<em>n</em> = 250, Australia), the age of the speaker, a climate activist, varied randomly to test the hypothesis that a younger activist would be more influential and increase motivation and responsibility to act compared to an older activist. In study 2 (<em>n</em> = 179, Israel), the age (young vs. old) of the group identified as being responsible for the climate crisis varied randomly, to test the hypothesis that people would be more willing to identify older people as being responsible for the current climate situation, and this would impact climate change-related attitudes, feelings, and behavioral intentions. Both studies resulted in null effects. Additionally, there was no interaction between the age of the respondent and the age of the source of the message or the age group being blamed by the message. The present study has failed to show that strategies that emphasize intergenerational conflict and ageism impact people’s attitudes, feelings, and behavioral intentions towards the current climate situation. This possibly can serve as an instigator for strategies that emphasize intergenerational solidarity, rather than conflict, as a guiding principle in future campaigns that advocate climate change adaptation and mitigation measures.</p>\n",

       "<p><em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> is a ubiquitous zoonotic parasite that can infect warm-blooded vertebrates, including humans. Felids, the definitive hosts, drive <em>T</em>. <em>gondii</em> infections by shedding the environmentally resistant stage of the parasite (oocysts) in their feces. Few studies characterize the role of climate and anthropogenic factors in oocyst shedding among free-ranging felids, which are responsible for the majority of environmental contamination. We determined how climate and anthropogenic factors influence oocyst shedding in free-ranging domestic cats and wild felids using generalized linear mixed models. <em>T</em>. <em>gondii</em> oocyst shedding data from 47 studies were systematically reviewed and compiled for domestic cats and six wild felid species, encompassing 256 positives out of 9,635 total fecal samples. Shedding prevalence in domestic cats and wild felids was positively associated with human population density at the sampling location. Larger mean diurnal temperature range was associated with more shedding among domestic cats and warmer temperature in the driest quarter was associated with lower oocyst shedding in wild felids. Increasing human population density and temperature fluctuation can exacerbate environmental contamination with the protozoan parasite <em>T</em>. <em>gondii</em>. Management of free-ranging domestic cats could lower the burden of environmental oocysts due to their large population sizes and affinity with human settlements.</p>\n",

       "<p>During the COVID-19 crisis, the apparel industry faced many challenges. Aggressive cost-cutting strategies became a top priority, and in turn, these influenced stressors and adversely affected business sustainability. This study examines the impact of aggressive strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic on business sustainability in the apparel industry of Sri Lanka. Further, it investigates whether the relationship between aggressive cost-cutting strategies and business sustainability was mediated by employee stress, considering aggressive cost reduction strategies and workplace environmental changes. This was a cross-sectional study with data collected from 384 employees in the apparel industry in Sri Lanka. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was applied to analyze the direct and indirect effects of aggressive cost reduction strategies and workplace environmental changes on sustainability with mediating effects of stress. Aggressive cost reduction strategies (Beta = 1.317, p = 0.000) and environmental changes (Beta = 0.251, p = 0.000) led to an increase in employee stress but did not affect business sustainability. Thus, employee stress (Beta = -0.028, p = 0.594) was not a mediator in the relationship between aggressive cost-cutting strategies and business sustainability; business sustainability was not a dependent variable. The findings proved that managing workplace stress, particularly improving stressful working environments and aggressive cost reduction strategies, can enhance employee satisfaction. Thus, managing employee stress could be beneficial for policymakers to focus on the area(s) required to retain competent employees. Moreover, aggressive strategies are unsuitable to apply during crisis to enhance business sustainability. The findings provide additional knowledge to the existing literature, enabling employees and employers to predict causes of stress and serve as a significant knowledge base for further studies.</p>\n",

       "<p>Lactic acid bacteria are commonly in the fermentation industry and pose potential positive effects on health. In this study, a new lactic acid bacterium was isolated from fermented vegetable extracts in Myoko, Niigata, Japan. This bacterium is fructophilic, acidophilic, and hard to grow on agar medium. The isolate is Gram-stain-positive, non-spore-forming, non-motile, rod-shaped, and catalase-negative. Growth occurred at pH 3.5–5.5, with optimal growth at pH 4.5–5.0. The cells formed colonies on a solid MRS medium with 20% (w/v) sucrose and 0.8% (w/v) gellan gum under anaerobic conditions. The bacterium was able to grow on up to 50% (w/v) sucrose but not on <span class=\"small-caps\">d</span>-glucose. Moreover, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the strain was most closely related to <em>Apilactobacillus ozensis</em> (93.1% sequence similarity). The values of average nucleotide identity, digital DNA-DNA hybridization, average amino acid sequence identity, and amino acid identity of conserved genes were calculated between the isolated strain (type strain is WR16-4<sup>T</sup> = NBRC 115064<sup>T</sup> = DSM 112857<sup>T</sup>) and its phylogenetically closest type strains. The average nucleotide identity values (73.36–78.28%) and DNA-DNA hybridization values (16.3–32.9%) were significantly lower than the threshold values for species boundaries. The average amino acid sequence identity values (53.96–60.88%) were significantly below the threshold boundary of genus demarcation (68%). The amino acid identity of conserved genes values compared to strain WR16-4<sup>T</sup> were the genera <em>Apilactobacillus</em>, <em>Nicoliella spurrieriana</em> SGEP1_A5<sup>T</sup>, <em>Acetilactobacillus jinshanensis</em> HSLZ-75<sup>T</sup>, and <em>Fructilactobacillus</em> were 62.51–63.79%, 62.87%, 62.03%, and 58.00–61.04%, respectively. The 16S rRNA gene and core genome phylogenetic trees suggested that this novel strain was most closely related to the type strain of <em>A</em>. <em>jinshanensis</em> HSLZ-75<sup>T</sup>. Based on the physiological, morphological, and phenotypical characteristics of strain WR16-4<sup>T</sup>, we propose its classification as a novel genus, <em>Philodulcilactobacillus myokoensis</em> gen. nov., sp. nov.</p>\n",

       "<p>This study focuses on the load balancing of the transactions in the blockchain. The problem is how to assign these transactions to the blocks. The objective is to guarantee a load balancing of the workload in the time of blocks. The proposed problem is an NP-hard one. To face the hardness of the studied problem, the challenge is to develop algorithms that solve the problem approximately. Finding an approximate solution is a real challenge. In this paper, nine algorithms are proposed. These algorithms are based on the dispatching-rules method, randomization approach, clustering algorithms, and iterative method. The proposed algorithms return approximate solutions in a remarkable time. In addition, in this paper, a novel architecture composed of blocks is proposed. This architecture adds the component “Balancer”. This component is responsible to call the best-proposed algorithm and solve the scheduling problem in a polynomial time. In addition, the proposed work helps users to solve the problem of big data concurrency. These algorithms are coded and compared. The performance of these algorithms is tested over three classes of instances. These classes are generated based on uniform distribution. The total number of instances tested is 1350. The average gap, execution time, and the percentage of the best-reached value are used as metrics to measure the performance of the proposed algorithms. Experimental results show the performance of these algorithms and a comparison between them is discussed. The experimental results show that the best algorithm is best-mi-transactions iterative multi-choice with 93.9% in an average running time of 0.003 s.</p>\n",

       "<p>Here we report on Neanderthal engravings on a cave wall at La Roche-Cotard (LRC) in central France, made more than 57±3 thousand years ago. Following human occupation, the cave was completely sealed by cold-period sediments, which prevented access until its discovery in the 19<sup>th</sup> century and first excavation in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. The timing of the closure of the cave is based on 50 optically stimulated luminescence ages derived from sediment collected inside and from around the cave. The anthropogenic origin of the spatially-structured, non-figurative marks found within the cave is confirmed using taphonomic, traceological and experimental evidence. Cave closure occurred significantly before the regional arrival of <em>H</em>. <em>sapiens</em>, and all artefacts from within the cave are typical Mousterian lithics; in Western Europe these are uniquely attributed to <em>H</em>. <em>neanderthalensis</em>. We conclude that the LRC engravings are unambiguous examples of Neanderthal abstract design.</p>\n",

However, for males, a significant change in scores appeared between two age bands of 14 to 15–16 (p&lt;0.003), ES (d = .45, 95% CI [.82–.07]), and 17–18 to 20+ (p&lt;0.001), ES (d = .6, 95% CI [.1.08–.1]).</p>\n",
       "<p>The change in psychological mindedness scores differed, and females did not have consistently higher scores than males. Females’ scores were only significantly higher for ages 14 (p&lt;0.01), ES (d = .43, 95% CI [.82–.04]), and 15–16 (p&lt;0.01), ES (d = .5, 95% CI [.87–.11]). As with the development of mentalizing abilities, female scores in psychological mindedness remained stable from 14 to 18 years of age, with a significant change between age bands 17–18 and 20+ (p&lt;0.01), ES (d = 1.2, 95% CI [1.7–.67]). Contrastingly, for males significant change occurred between 15–16, 17–18 (p&lt;0.01), ES (d = .65, 95% CI [1.1–.18]) and 20+ (p&lt;0.01), ES (d = .84, 95% CI [1.5–.2]).</p>\n",
       "<p>A significant positive association was found between mentalizing and psychological mindedness and the personality traits of Agreeableness, Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness (p&lt;0.0001).

       "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n",
       "<p>The aim of this study was to design a new canine posture estimation system specifically for working dogs. The system was composed of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) that are commercially available, and a supervised learning algorithm which was developed for different behaviours. Three IMUs, each containing a 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, were attached to the dogs’ chest, back, and neck. To build and test the model, data were collected during a video-recorded behaviour test where the trainee assistance dogs performed static postures (standing, sitting, lying down) and dynamic activities (walking, body shake). Advanced feature extraction techniques were employed for the first time in this field, including statistical, temporal, and spectral methods. The most important features for posture prediction were chosen using Select K Best with ANOVA F-value. The individual contributions of each IMU, sensor, and feature type were analysed using Select K Best scores and Random Forest feature importance. Results showed that the back and chest IMUs were more important than the neck IMU, and the accelerometers were more important than the gyroscopes. The addition of IMUs to the chest and back of dog harnesses is recommended to improve performance. Additionally, statistical and temporal feature domains were more important than spectral feature domains. Three novel cascade arrangements of Random Forest and Isolation Forest were fitted to the dataset. The best classifier achieved an f1-macro of 0.83 and an f1-weighted of 0.90 for the prediction of the five postures, demonstrating a better performance than previous studies. These results were attributed to the data collection methodology (number of subjects and observations, multiple IMUs, use of common working dog breeds) and novel machine learning techniques (advanced feature extraction, feature selection and modelling arrangements) employed. The dataset and code used are publicly available on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.17632/mpph6bmn7g.1\">Mendeley Data</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/mmarcato/dog_posture\">GitHub</a>, respectively.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Background</h3>\n",
       "<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, concern has been raised about suicide risk among healthcare workers (HCWs). We investigated the incidence risk and prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behaviour (STB), and their relationship with occupational risk factors, among National Health Service HCWs in England between April 2020 and August 2021.</p>\n",
       "<h3>Methods</h3>\n",
       "<p>In this longitudinal study, we analysed online survey data completed by 22,501 HCWs from 17 NHS Trusts at baseline (Time 1) and six months (Time 2). The primary outcome measures were suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and non-suicidal self-injury. We used logistic regression to investigate the relationship between these outcomes and demographic characteristics and occupational factors. Results were stratified by occupational role (clinical/non-clinical).</p>\n",
       "<h3>Results</h3>\n",
       "<p>Time 1 and Time 2 surveys were completed by 12,514 and 7,160 HCWs, respectively. At baseline, 10.8% (95% CI = 10.1%, 11.6%) of participants reported having experienced suicidal thoughts in the previous two months, whilst 2.1% (95% CI = 1.8%, 2.5%) of participants reported having attempted suicide over the same period. Among HCWs who had not experienced suicidal thoughts at baseline (and who completed the Time 2 survey), 11.3% (95%CI = 10.4%, 12.3%) reported such thoughts six months later. Six months after baseline, 3.9% (95% CI = 3.4%, 4.4%) of HCWs reported attempting suicide for the first time. Exposure to potentially morally injurious events, lack of confidence about raising safety concerns and these concerns being addressed, feeling unsupported by managers, and providing a reduced standard of care were all associated with increased suicidal ideation among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. At six months, among clinicians, a lack of confidence about safety concerns being addressed, independently predicted suicidal ideation.</p>\n",

       "<p>There is widespread debate on whether to anonymize author identities in peer review. The key argument for anonymization is to mitigate bias, whereas arguments against anonymization posit various uses of author identities in the review process. The Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS) 2023 conference adopted a middle ground by initially anonymizing the author identities from reviewers, revealing them after the reviewer had submitted their initial reviews, and allowing the reviewer to change their review subsequently. We present an analysis of the reviews pertaining to the identification and use of author identities. Our key findings are: (I) A majority of reviewers self-report not knowing and being unable to guess the authors’ identities for the papers they were reviewing. (II) After the initial submission of reviews, 7.1% of reviews changed their overall merit score and 3.8% changed their self-reported reviewer expertise. (III) There is a very weak and statistically insignificant correlation of the rank of authors’ affiliations with the change in overall merit; there is a weak but statistically significant correlation with respect to change in reviewer expertise. We also conducted an anonymous survey to obtain opinions from reviewers and authors. The main findings from the 200 survey responses are: (i) A vast majority of participants favor anonymizing author identities in some form. (ii) The “middle-ground” initiative of ITCS 2023 was appreciated. (iii) Detecting conflicts of interest is a challenge that needs to be addressed if author identities are anonymized. Overall, these findings support anonymization of author identities in some form (e.g., as was done in ITCS 2023), as long as there is a robust and efficient way to check conflicts of interest.</p>\n",

       "<p>Using nationally representative data from the Health and Retirement Study (n = 5,823), we examined the association between experiencing parental/caregiver death or separation before age 16 and four indicators of immune function in late-life: C-reactive Protein (CRP), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble Tumor Necrosis Factor (sTNFR), and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) response to cytomegalovirus (CMV). We also examined racial/ethnic differences.</p>\n",

       "<p>Individuals that identified as racial/ethnic minorities were more likely to experience parental/caregiver loss and parental separation in early life compared to Non-Hispanic Whites, and had poorer immune function in late-life. We found consistent associations between experiencing parental/caregiver loss and separation and poor immune function measured by CMV IgG levels and IL-6 across all racial/ethnic subgroups. For example, among Non-Hispanic Blacks, those that experienced parental/caregiver death before age 16 had a 26% increase in CMV IgG antibodies in late-life (β = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.17, 1.34) compared to a 3% increase in CMV antibodies among Non-Hispanic Whites (β = 1.03; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.07) controlling for age, gender, and parental education.</p>\n",

       "<p><em>Candida auris</em>, the youngest <em>Candida</em> species, is known to cause candidiasis and candidemia in humans and has been related to several hospital outbreaks. Moreover, <em>Candida auris</em> infections are largely resistant to the antifungal drugs currently in clinical use, necessitating the development of novel medications and approaches to treat such infections. Following up on our previous studies that demonstrated eugenol tosylate congeners (ETCs) to have antifungal activity, several ETCs (C1-C6) were synthesized to find a lead molecule with the requisite antifungal activity against <em>C</em>. <em>auris</em>. Preliminary tests, including broth microdilution and the MUSE cell viability assay, identified C5 as the most active derivative, with a MIC value of 0.98 g/mL against all strains tested. Cell count and viability assays further validated the fungicidal activity of C5. Apoptotic indicators, such as phosphatidylserine externalization, DNA fragmentation, mitochondrial depolarization, decreased cytochrome c and oxidase activity and cell death confirmed that C5 caused apoptosis in <em>C</em>. <em>auris</em> isolates. The low cytotoxicity of C5 further confirmed the safety of using this derivative in future studies. To support the conclusions drawn in this investigation, additional <em>in vivo</em> experiments demonstrating the antifungal activity of this lead compound in animal models will be needed.</p>\n",

       "<p>This study seeks to understand how micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) can be innovative while developing their reputation. In doing so, this study focuses on companies classified as promoters of Colombia’s “orange economy,” which relates to the country’s cultural and creative diversity. Firms with a non-technological emphasis also require knowledge, innovation, and reputation to perform better. In this regard, the study is based on the work of Hormiga and Garcia-Almeida (2016) who proposed the relationship between accumulated knowledge and innovation as background of reputation. In this paper, the purpose is to understand the internal reputation-building process carried out by MSMEs and the variables that intervene. Therefore, this research accounts for how MSMEs can build their reputation through innovation and accumulated knowledge. For this, a survey was conducted in 320 orange economy MSMEs located in Bogotá, Colombia, and the relationship of these variables was statistically tested through a quantitative analysis of multivariate data. Innovation was found to not impact the performance of companies, but this can be associated to factors that were not considered in this research. However, it is proposed to refine the original model by considering the manager’s perspective. It is recommended that entrepreneurs invest resources in accumulating internal (tacit) knowledge to improve skills that enhance reputation.</p>\n",

       "<p>Rural residents account for the bulk of poverty in developing countries. This paper evaluates the impact of Indonesia’s <em>Dana Desa</em> program (Village Fund Program or VFP) on rural poverty and female labour force participation. The VFP, introduced in 2014, was an ambitious national-level village governance program which transferred administrative responsibility and financial resources to Indonesia’s 79,000 plus rural villages, providing them with the autonomy to invest in rural infrastructure, human capital, and job creation programs. Using nationally representative data from before and after the program, we show that the implementation of the VFP was associated with an improvement in rural household’s consumption expenditure among households, particularly among agricultural households. Female labour force participation in rural areas increased by about 10 percentage points and there is also evidence of a sectoral shift away from agricultural employment towards jobs in the service sector. This improvement in labour force participation is associated with poverty reduction among rural households.</p>\n",

       "<p>Aiming at the shortcomings of the traditional level set model which only has good robustness to the weak boundary and strong noise of the original target image, this paper proposes an improved algorithm based on the no-weight initialization level set model, introducing bilateral filters and using implicit surface level sets to extract and segment the original target image object more accurately, clearly and intuitively in the evolution process. The experimental simulation results show that, compared with the traditional non-reinitialized level set model segmentation method, the improved method can more accurately extract the edge contours of the target image object, and has better edge contour extraction effect, and the original target noise reduction effect of the improved model is better than that of the model before the improvement. The original target image object edge contour takes less time to extract than the conventional non-reinitialized level set model before the improvement.</p>\n",

       "<p>Risk perception research, targeting the general public, necessitates the study of the multi-faceted aspects of perceived risk through a holistic approach. This study aimed to investigate the association between the two dimensions of risk perception of COVID-19, i.e., risk as a feeling and analysis, trust in the current government, political ideologies, and socio-demographic factors in South Korea. This study used a year-long repeated cross-sectional design, in which a national sample (n = 23,018) participated in 23 consecutive telephone surveys from February 2020 to February 2021. Most factors differed in the magnitude and direction of their relationships with the two dimensions of risk perception. However, trust in the current government, alone, delineated an association in the same direction for both dimensions, i.e., those with a lower level of trust exhibited higher levels of cognitive and affective risk perception. Although these results did not change significantly during the one-year observation period, they are related to the political interpretation of risk. This study revealed that affective and cognitive risk perceptions addressed different dimensions of risk perception. These findings could help governments and health authorities better understand the nature and mechanisms of public risk perception when implementing countermeasures and policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and other public health emergencies.</p>\n",

       "<h3>Study design</h3>\n",
       "<p>CSF was obtained at initial surgical intervention. One aliquot was stored in skim milk-tryptone-glucose-glycerol (STGG) medium and the second was unprocessed; both were then stored at –70°C. Bacterial growth for CSF samples stored in STGG were subsequently characterized using aerobic and anaerobic culture on blood agar and MALDI-TOF sequencing. All unprocessed CSF samples underwent 16S quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) sequencing, and a subset underwent standard clinical microbiological culture. CSF with culture growth (either after storage in STGG or standard clinical) were further analyzed using whole-genome amplification sequencing (WGAS).</p>\n",
       "<h3>Results</h3>\n",
       "<p>11/66 (17%) samples stored in STGG and 1/36 (3%) that underwent standard clinical microbiological culture demonstrated bacterial growth. Of the organisms present, 8 were common skin flora and 4 were potential pathogens; only 1 was also qPCR positive. WGAS findings and STGG culture findings were concordant for only 1 sample, identifying <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis</em>. No significant difference in time to second surgical intervention was observed between the STGG culture-positive and negative groups.</p>\n",

       "<p>Using high sensitivity methods, we detected the presence of bacteria in a subset of CSF samples at the time of first surgery. Therefore, the true presence of bacteria in CSF of children with hydrocephalus cannot be ruled out, though our findings may suggest these bacteria are contaminants or false positives of the detection methods. Regardless of origin, the detection of microbiota in the CSF of these children may not have any clinical significance.</p>\n",

       "<p>This study investigates the role of source credibility on minority participant recruitment, particularly African American and Black Caribbean patients. A total of nine focus groups (N = 48 participants) were conducted with both patient groups and clinical research coordinators (CRCs). Using the elaboration likelihood model as a guiding framework for analysis, this study found that the credibility of research coordinators (or other professionals who recruit for research studies and clinical trials) was instrumental in shaping attitudes of prospective participants. The perspectives of patients and CRCs aligned closely, with few exceptions. For both groups, professionalism and professional displays (clothing, institutional artifacts) enhanced perceived expertise, a core component of credibility. Trustworthiness, another important component of credibility, was fostered through homophily between recruiter and patient, expressions of goodwill and assuaging anxiety about CRCs’ financial motivations for recruitment. Additionally, CRCs believed that credibility was supported when CRCs could emphasize transparency and truthfulness in communication. The importance of these findings for the development of empirically-based training programs to improve communication practices in recruitment contexts is discussed.</p>\n",

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Background: </span>Self-medication counseling in community pharmacies plays a crucial role in health care. Counseling advice should therefore be evidence-based. Web-based information and databases are commonly used as electronic information sources. EVInews is a self-medication–related information tool consisting of a database and monthly published newsletters for pharmacists. Little is known about the quality of pharmacists’ electronic information sources for evidence-based self-medication counseling.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>Our aim was to investigate the quality of community pharmacists’ web-based search results for self-medication–related content in comparison with the EVInews database, based on an adjusted quality score for pharmacists.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>After receiving ethics approval, we performed a quantitative web-based survey with a search task as a prospective randomized, controlled, and unblinded trial. For the search task, participants were instructed to search for evidence-based information to verify 6 health-related statements from 2 typical self-medication indications. Pharmacists across Germany were invited via email to participate. After providing written informed consent, they were automatically, randomly assigned to use either web-based information sources of their choice without the EVInews database (web group) or exclusively the EVInews database (EVInews group). The quality of the information sources that were used for the search task was then assessed by 2 evaluators using a quality score ranging from 100% (180 points, all predefined criteria fulfilled) to 0% (0 points, none of the predefined criteria fulfilled).

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Background: </span>To ensure the timely diagnosis of emerging infectious diseases, high-tech molecular biotechnology is often used to detect pathogens and has gradually become the gold standard for virological testing. However, beginners and students are often unable to practice their skills due to the higher costs associated with high-level virological testing, the increasing complexity of the equipment, and the limited number of specimens from patients. Therefore, a new training program is necessary to increase training and reduce the risk of test failure.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>The aim of the study is to (1) develop and implement a virtual reality (VR) software for simulated and interactive high-level virological testing that can be applied in clinical practice and skills building or training settings and (2) evaluate the VR simulation’s effectiveness on reaction, learning, and behavior of the students (trainees).<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>Viral nucleic acid tests on a BD MAX instrument were selected for our VR project because it is a high-tech automatic detection system. There was cooperation between teachers of medical technology and biomedical engineering. Medical technology teachers were responsible for designing the lesson plan, and the biomedical engineering personnel developed the VR software. We designed a novel VR teaching software to simulate cognitive learning via various procedure scenarios and interactive models. The VR software contains 2D VR “cognitive test and learning” lessons and 3D VR “practical skills training” lessons. We evaluated students’ learning effectiveness pre- and posttraining and then recorded their behavior patterns when answering questions, performing repeated exercises, and engaging in clinical practice.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>The results showed that the use of the VR software met participants’ needs and enhanced their interest in learning. The average posttraining scores of participants exposed to 2D and 3D VR training were significantly higher than participants who were exposed solely to traditional demonstration teaching (<i>P</i>&lt;.001). Behavioral assessments of students pre- and posttraining showed that students exposed to VR-based training to acquire relevant knowledge of advanced virological testing exhibited significantly improved knowledge of specific items posttraining (<i>P</i>&lt;.01). A higher participant score led to fewer attempts when responding to each item in a matching task. Thus, VR can enhance students’ understanding of difficult topics.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>The VR program designed for this study can reduce the costs associated with virological testing training, thus, increasing their accessibility for students and beginners. It can also reduce the risk of viral infections particularly during disease outbreaks (eg, the COVID-19 pandemic) and also enhance students’ learning motivation to strengthen their practical skills.<br></p>\n",

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Background: </span>Testicular sperm extraction (TESE) is an essential therapeutic tool for the management of male infertility. However, it is an invasive procedure with a success rate up to 50%. To date, no model based on clinical and laboratory parameters is sufficiently powerful to accurately predict the success of sperm retrieval in TESE.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>The aim of this study is to compare a wide range of predictive models under similar conditions for TESE outcomes in patients with nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) to identify the correct mathematical approach to apply, most appropriate study size, and relevance of the input biomarkers.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>We analyzed 201 patients who underwent TESE at Tenon Hospital (Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Sorbonne University, Paris), distributed in a retrospective training cohort of 175 patients (January 2012 to April 2021) and a prospective testing cohort (May 2021 to December 2021) of 26 patients. Preoperative data (according to the French standard exploration of male infertility, 16 variables) including urogenital history, hormonal data, genetic data, and TESE outcomes (representing the target variable) were collected. A TESE was considered positive if we obtained sufficient spermatozoa for intracytoplasmic sperm injection. After preprocessing the raw data, 8 machine learning (ML) models were trained and optimized on the retrospective training cohort data set: The hyperparameter tuning was performed by random search. Finally, the prospective testing cohort data set was used for the model evaluation. The metrics used to evaluate and compare the models were the following: sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), and accuracy. The importance of each variable in the model was assessed using the permutation feature importance technique, and the optimal number of patients to include in the study was assessed using the learning curve.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>The ensemble models, based on decision trees, showed the best performance, especially the random forest model, which yielded the following results: AUC=0.90, sensitivity=100%, and specificity=69.2%. Furthermore, a study size of 120 patients seemed sufficient to properly exploit the preoperative data in the modeling process, since increasing the number of patients beyond 120 during model training did not bring any performance improvement. Furthermore, inhibin B and a history of varicoceles exhibited the highest predictive capacity.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>An ML algorithm based on an appropriate approach can predict successful sperm retrieval in men with NOA undergoing TESE, with promising performance. However, although this study is consistent with the first step of this process, a subsequent formal prospective multicentric validation study should be undertaken before any clinical applications. As future work, we consider the use of recent and clinically relevant data sets (including seminal plasma biomarkers, especially noncoding RNAs, as markers of residual spermatogenesis in NOA patients) to improve our results even more.<br></p>\n",

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of a novel theoretically driven internet-based intervention for first-year college students who identify as women (RealConsent) in reducing their risk of exposure to SV and alcohol misuse as well as increasing alcohol protective and bystander behaviors.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>This randomized controlled trial involved first-year college students who identified as women (n=881) attending 1 of 3 universities in the southeastern United States. Participants aged 18 to 20 years were randomized to RealConsent (444/881, 50.4%) or to an attention-matched placebo control (437/881, 49.6%). RealConsent is fully automated and consists of four 45-minute modules that incorporate entertainment-education media and proven behavior change techniques. The primary outcome was exposure to SV; the secondary outcomes were alcohol protective behaviors, dating risk behaviors, alcohol misuse, and bystander behavior. Study outcomes were assessed at baseline and 6-month follow-up.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>Among participants with some exposure to SV, those in the RealConsent group experienced less exposure to SV than the placebo group (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.33-0.69; <i>P</i>=.002). Furthermore, participants in the RealConsent group engaged in more alcohol protective behaviors (adjusted odds ratio 1.17, 95% CI 0.12-2.22; <i>P</i>=.03) and were less likely to binge drink (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.67-0.97; <i>P</i>=.003). Finally, participants in the RealConsent group who had 100% dosage were more likely to engage in bystander behavior than those with &lt;100% dosage plus placebo group (adjusted odds ratio 1.72, 95% CI 1.17-2.55; <i>P</i>=.006).<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>A comprehensive exposure to SV, alcohol use, and bystander educational program was successful in decreasing the occurrence of exposure to SV among those most at risk and in increasing alcohol protective behaviors. Because of its web-based and mobile technologies, RealConsent can be easily disseminated and holds potential for reducing campus SV.<br></p>\n",

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Background: </span>Taxonomies and models are useful tools for defining eHealth content and intervention features, enabling comparison and analysis of research across studies and disciplines. The Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy version 1 (BCTTv1) was developed to decrease ambiguity in defining specific characteristics inherent in health interventions, but it was developed outside the context of digital technology. In contrast, the Persuasive System Design Model (PSDM) was developed to define and evaluate the persuasive content in software solutions but did not have a specific focus on health. Both the BCTTv1 and PSDM have been used to define eHealth interventions in the literature, with some researchers combining or reducing the taxonomies to simplify their application. It is unclear how well the taxonomies accurately define eHealth and whether they should be used alone or in combination.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>This scoping review explored how the BCTTv1 and PSDM capture the content and intervention features of parent-focused eHealth as part of a program of studies investigating the use of technology to support parents with therapy home programs for children with special health care needs. It explored the active ingredients and persuasive technology features commonly found in parent-focused eHealth interventions for children with special health care needs and how the descriptions overlap and interact with respect to the BCTTv1 and PSDM taxonomies.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>A scoping review was used to clarify concepts in the literature related to these taxonomies. Keywords related to parent-focused eHealth were defined and used to systematically search several electronic databases for parent-focused eHealth publications. Publications referencing the same intervention were combined to provide comprehensive intervention details. The data set was coded using codebooks developed from the taxonomies in NVivo (version 12; QSR International) and qualitatively analyzed using matrix queries.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>The systematic search found 23 parent-focused eHealth interventions described in 42 articles from various countries; delivered to parents with children aged 1 to 18 years; and covering medical, behavioral, and developmental issues. The predominant active ingredients and intervention features in parent-focused eHealth were concerned with teaching parents behavioral skills, encouraging them to practice and monitor the new skills, and tracking the outcomes of performing the new skills. No category had a complete set of active ingredients or intervention features coded. The two taxonomies conceptually captured different constructs even when their labels appeared to overlap in meaning. In addition, coding by category missed important active ingredients and intervention features.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>The taxonomies were found to code different constructs related to behavior change and persuasive technology, discouraging the merging or reduction of the taxonomies. This scoping review highlighted the benefit of using both taxonomies in their entirety to capture active ingredients and intervention features important for comparing and analyzing eHealth across different studies and disciplines.<br></p>\n",

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Background: </span>Although social media has the potential to spread misinformation, it can also be a valuable tool for elucidating the social factors that contribute to the onset of negative beliefs. As a result, data mining has become a widely used technique in infodemiology and infoveillance research to combat misinformation effects. On the other hand, there is a lack of studies that specifically aim to investigate misinformation about fluoride on Twitter. Web-based individual concerns on the side effects of fluoridated oral care products and tap water stimulate the emergence and propagation of convictions that boost antifluoridation activism. In this sense, a previous content analysis–driven study demonstrated that the term <i>fluoride-free</i> was frequently associated with antifluoridation interests.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>This study aimed to analyze “fluoride-free” tweets regarding their topics and frequency of publication over time.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>A total of 21,169 tweets published in English between May 2016 and May 2022 that included the keyword “fluoride-free” were retrieved by the Twitter application programming interface. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling was applied to identify the salient terms and topics. The similarity between topics was calculated through an intertopic distance map. Moreover, an investigator manually assessed a sample of tweets depicting each of the most representative word groups that determined specific issues. Lastly, additional data visualization was performed regarding the total count of each topic of fluoride-free record and its relevance over time, using Elastic Stack software.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>We identified 3 issues by applying the LDA topic modeling: “healthy lifestyle” (topic 1), “consumption of natural/organic oral care products” (topic 2), and “recommendations for using fluoride-free products/measures” (topic 3). Topic 1 was related to users’ concerns about leading a healthier lifestyle and the potential impacts of fluoride consumption, including its hypothetical toxicity. Complementarily, topic 2 was associated with users’ personal interests and perceptions of consuming natural and organic fluoride-free oral care products, whereas topic 3 was linked to users’ recommendations for using fluoride-free products (eg, switching from fluoridated toothpaste to fluoride-free alternatives) and measures (eg, consuming unfluoridated bottled water instead of fluoridated tap water), comprising the propaganda of dental products. Additionally, the count of tweets on fluoride-free content decreased between 2016 and 2019 but increased again from 2020 onward.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>Public concerns toward a healthy lifestyle, including the adoption of natural and organic cosmetics, seem to be the main motivation of the recent increase of “fluoride-free” tweets, which can be boosted by the propagation of fluoride falsehoods on the web. Therefore, public health authorities, health professionals, and legislators should be aware of the spread of fluoride-free content on social media to create and implement strategies against their potential health damage for the population.<br></p>\n",

Little data are available for Germany, and no study has so far compared usage patterns with people’s awareness of SCs and the perception of usefulness.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>We explored the sociodemographic and individual characteristics that are associated with the awareness, usage, and perceived usefulness of SCs in the German population.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>We conducted a cross-sectional online survey among 1084 German residents in July 2022 regarding personal characteristics and people’s awareness and usage of SCs. Using random sampling from a commercial panel, we collected participant responses stratified by gender, state of residence, income, and age to reflect the German population. We analyzed the collected data exploratively.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>Of all respondents, 16.3% (177/1084) were aware of SCs and 6.5% (71/1084) had used them before. Those aware of SCs were younger (mean 38.8, SD 14.6 years, vs mean 48.3, SD 15.7 years), were more often female (107/177, 60.5%, vs 453/907, 49.9%), and had higher formal education levels (eg, 72/177, 40.7%, vs 238/907, 26.2%, with a university/college degree) than those unaware. The same observation applied to users compared to nonusers. It disappeared, however, when comparing users to nonusers who were aware of SCs. Among users, 40.8% (29/71) considered these tools useful. Those considering them useful reported higher self-efficacy (mean 4.21, SD 0.66, vs mean 3.63, SD 0.81, on a scale of 1-5) and a higher net household income (mean EUR 2591.63, SD EUR 1103.96 [mean US $2798.96, SD US $1192.28], vs mean EUR 1626.60, SD EUR 649.05 [mean US $1756.73, SD US $700.97]) than those who considered them not useful. More women considered SCs unhelpful (13/44, 29.5%) compared to men (4/26, 15.4%).<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>Concurring with studies from other countries, our findings show associations between sociodemographic characteristics and SC usage in a German sample: users were on average younger, of higher socioeconomic status, and more commonly female compared to nonusers. However, usage cannot be explained by sociodemographic differences alone. It rather seems that sociodemographics explain who is or is not aware of the technology, but those who are aware of SCs are equally likely to use them, independently of sociodemographic differences. Although in some groups (eg, people with anxiety disorder), more participants reported to know and use SCs, they tended to perceive them as less useful. In other groups (eg, male participants), fewer respondents were aware of SCs, but those who used them perceived them to be more useful. Thus, SCs should be designed to fit specific user needs, and strategies should be developed to help reach individuals who could benefit but are not aware of SCs yet.<br></p>\n",

       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Digital mental health services are becoming increasingly valuable for addressing the global public health burden of mental ill-health. There is significant demand for scalable and effective web-based mental health services. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve mental health through the deployment of chatbots. These chatbots can provide round-the-clock support and triage individuals who are reluctant to access traditional health care due to stigma. The aim of this viewpoint paper is to consider the feasibility of AI-powered platforms to support mental well-being. The Leora model is considered a model with the potential to provide mental health support. Leora is a conversational agent that uses AI to engage in conversations with users about their mental health and provide support for minimal-to-mild symptoms of anxiety and depression. The tool is designed to be accessible, personalized, and discreet, offering strategies for promoting well-being and acting as a web-based self-care coach. Across all AI-powered mental health services, there are several challenges in the ethical development and deployment of AI in mental health treatment, including trust and transparency, bias and health inequity, and the potential for negative consequences. To ensure the effective and ethical use of AI in mental health care, researchers must carefully consider these challenges and engage with key stakeholders to provide high-quality mental health support. Validation of the Leora platform through rigorous user testing will be the next step in ensuring the model is effective.</p>\n",

       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Mental health is a significant public health concern. Globally, it is estimated that 1 in every 8 people lives with a mental disorder [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></span>]. Mental health service use for depression was estimated to range from 33% in high-income countries to 8% in low- and middle-income countries [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></span>]. A significant gap exists between mental ill-health and access to clinical services. Further, global estimates have not yet captured the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some preliminary estimates suggest that an additional 76.2 million cases of anxiety disorders could be attributed to COVID-19 [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref3\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The outbreak of COVID-19 and subsequent stay-at-home requirements from governments across the world were the precursors to a significant increase in the demand for mental health services [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref4\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></span>]. Amid uncertainty in health and employment, individuals reported that mental ill-health was exacerbated [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref4\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></span>]. In response, the World Health Organization stated, “the scaling-up and reorganization of mental health services that is now needed on a global scale is an opportunity to build a mental health system that is fit for the future” [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref5\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Web-based mental health services are a key to improved service delivery that can be augmented to meet the needs of the changing times ahead [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref6\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></span>]. Telehealth appointments, whose reach was expanded during the pandemic, are an effective way digital health was deployed. Research suggests that the expansion of telehealth services was generally well-accepted [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref7\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></span>]. However, long wait times limit the accessibility of telehealth services. Moreover, the demand for clinically effective web-based mental health tools and services far exceeds the supply [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref8\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref9\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></span>]. COVID-19 required a significant rethinking and restructuring of what effective mental health care service delivery looks like. With this, evidence-based, efficacious, and easily scalable digital mental health services are increasingly needed.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Artificial-Intelligence-in-the-Context-of-Mental-Health-Treatment\" data-label=\"Artificial-Intelligence-in-the-Context-of-Mental-Health-Treatment\">Artificial Intelligence in the Context of Mental Health Treatment</h3>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of computer systems to display intelligent behavior by analyzing an environment and taking action with some degree of autonomy [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref10\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></span>]. In health care, AI is prominently used in the context of predicting, detecting, and treating illness. This is particularly useful when developing solutions for large-scale problems. Burgeoning examples of this can be found in clinical settings [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref11\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></span>] as well as in translational medical research [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref12\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref13\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></span>]. Another way AI is being used is in chatbots, where it has the potential to make an impact in the area of mental health [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref14\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref15\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></span>]. Chatbots are software that engages in dialog with individuals using natural language [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref16\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The advent of these mental health bots has the potential to be useful in several ways. For one, therapeutic chatbots can provide a platform for individuals to engage at any hour of the day in self-help. Ready access to digital therapies and tools is important given that distressed individuals may seek help outside business hours. Bots also have the potential to triage individuals who feel stigmatized by the current health care model and who otherwise would not be comfortable accessing treatment. Reluctance to access help due to the fear of being judged or labeled is a significant barrier for individuals to access mental health support [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref17\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></span>]. Men and some minority groups report stigma as being particularly prolific in this context [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref18\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref19\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Woebot [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref20\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></span>] and Wysa [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref21\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></span>] are 2 examples of AI chatbots in the field of mental health. Woebot uses cognitive behavioral therapy and was found to significantly reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in young adults [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref15\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></span>]. Wysa also reported a reduction in self-reported symptoms of depression and reported that 68% of the cohort found the app helpful and encouraging [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref14\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></span>]. These tools show potential for AI mental health chatbots; however, critiques have been made about the size of the sample in the validation studies and the lack of research on their long-term efficacy [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref22\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></span>]. Given the potential for AI-powered tools to address mental ill-health at scale, further research into the development and validity of this technology needs to be completed.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Challenges-of-AI-in-Mental-Health-Treatment\" data-label=\"Challenges-of-AI-in-Mental-Health-Treatment\">Challenges of AI in Mental Health Treatment</h3>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Providing mental health treatments necessitates ethical scrutiny, especially when incorporating AI into brief assessments and the support of users. The difficulty of designing ethically robust interventions with AI is that ethical design and review cannot remain a one-off, as the technology itself is continuously developing for both the user and clinical providers [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref23\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></span>]. Transparency in the development and limitations of AI are important considerations. For example, how an algorithm works to predict and learn is especially important to understand in the context of mental health, particularly regarding how it relates to patient safety and the potential provision of clinical advice. Further, confidentiality and anonymity are a particular concern for mental health tool users, given the stigma associated with mental ill-health [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref24\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref25\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></span>], as are data ownership and privacy rights, which are difficult but important elements to manage [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref26\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"The-Proposed-Model\" data-label=\"The-Proposed-Model\">The Proposed Model</h3>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">In consideration of the aforementioned challenges of AI development for mental health support, the AI platform Leora has incorporated a model of development that is transparent, ethical, and user-focused with regard to data privacy. An understanding that AI is currently best suited as a mental health support tool and early service entrance assistant for users has guided the development of Leora toward its focus as an AI mental health support program.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Leora is a conversational agent that leverages AI to engage in discussions with users about their mental health. Accessible via a web browser and mobile app, this digital toolkit has the capacity to assist individuals with mental ill-health by assessing, monitoring, and managing minimal-to-mild symptoms of anxiety and depression. Further, Leora provides evidence-based strategies to cope with distress and promote well-being. Leora is positioned as a web-based self-care coach and offers easily accessible, personalized, and discreet mental health support.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Leora’s-Roadmap-for-AI-Support\" data-label=\"Leora’s-Roadmap-for-AI-Support\">Leora’s Roadmap for AI Support</h3>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">An interaction with Leora is illustrated in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure1\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 1</a></span>. The first step is identifying the individual’s needs. This is an important component of patient-centered care and is associated with more promising patient outcomes [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref27\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref28\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></span>]. AI can gauge the appropriate clinical need via a standardized evaluation tool for anxiety and depression, which are the most common mental health concerns [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></span>]. It can do this by using natural language processing—an algorithm that allows a computer to understand language as it is spoken and written [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref29\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">An important ethical consideration in developing and implementing AI digital health solutions in the mental health field is that solutions and services must provide clinically appropriate recommendations [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref30\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></span>]. By integrating the standardized measures of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item scale (PHQ-9) into the platform, recommendations and referrals will be clinically valid in terms of criterion, construct, factorial, and procedural validity (see [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref31\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref32\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></span>] for GAD-7 validity testing and [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref33\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref34\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></span>] for PHQ-9 validity testing). Individuals with clinically significant scores on these measures will be directed to mental health services to book an in-person therapy session. Individuals with low or no indication of anxiety and depression symptoms will be directed to psychoeducation and mindfulness strategies, deemed efficacious for those needing to understand their mood and cognitive changes. This approach to care is standardized and is well-used by many web-based mental health services [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref35\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref36\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></span>]. Individuals with mild depression and anxiety scores will be directed to strategies to manage these factors based on mental health first aid techniques grounded in brief cognitive behavioral therapy [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref37\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref38\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></span>] and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, also known as mindfulness [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref39\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></span>].</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\"><span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure2\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 2</a></span> illustrates a flowchart of the evaluation of mental health support strategies that Leora would offer an individual. If strategies to reduce the impact of depression and anxiety were not considered helpful by the individual, the platform would refer the user to another strategy that may provide improved support. If the strategy is considered effective by the individual, posttechnique support and maintenance sessions may be offered.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Blending-AI-and-Humanistic-Therapy\" data-label=\"Blending-AI-and-Humanistic-Therapy\">Blending AI and Humanistic Therapy</h3>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The platform blends AI with authentic, human-first, psychological support known as humanistic therapy [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref40\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></span>]. The conversational agent can engage in meaningful conversations with the individual, conduct standardized assessments, and book therapy for those who need more support (see <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure3\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 3</a></span> for the interface examples).</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Patient safety is paramount throughout client engagement. Leora has developed “escalation pathways” into the design of triaging patients. A self-assessment that indicates an individual has clinically significant levels of anxiety and depression will be referred to appropriate services, such as a psychologist or a local mental health emergency contact (eg, a mental health crisis website or phone service). In the instance that the client meets the criteria for a referral process, the platform would assist the user to access an appointment with nonconfrontational wording, for example, “You might want to get support beyond what I can help you and that’s not a problem at all! I know a network of experienced mental health professionals. I can assist you in booking sessions with them.”</p>\n",

       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Accessibility, equity, clinical effectiveness, user acceptability, and satisfaction, as well as service efficiency, are components of ethical digital health solutions [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref41\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></span>] and can be evaluated by data drawn from Leora. As such, data collected from the cycle of support and evaluation of individual users can be assessed and integrated back into the model to improve the AI service. This iterative design process, characteristic of AI and machine learning models, gives Leora scope to improve by integrating the experiences of a variety of users. Independently, qualitative feedback and internal or external user experience testing are additional layers of evidence to cross-reference with the review data of client sessions with Leora.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Data-Safety-Encryption-and-Anonymity\" data-label=\"Data-Safety-Encryption-and-Anonymity\">Data Safety, Encryption, and Anonymity</h3>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Leora is stored on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud servers and is secured by virtual private cloud networking configurations. Data are protected from exposure to the public-facing internet through the strict configuration of security groups, subnet settings, and the use of identity access management. This establishes the highest degree of privacy for collected data and ensures that it cannot be leveraged for commercial use. Leora’s architecture is protected by the AWS Encryption Software Development Kit (Amazon Web Services, Inc), which uses envelope encryption. This form of multilayered encryption involves first generating a key for the data chunk at the application layer and then wrapping or encrypting this key again at the storage layer, creating a hierarchy of keys with access governance controlled by identity access management [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref42\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></span>]. To decrypt the encrypted message, the AWS Encryption Software Development Kit uses the wrapping key to decrypt at least one encrypted data key. It can then decrypt the ciphertext and return a plaintext message. Leora is compliant with the Australian Privacy Policy [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref43\" rel=\"footnote\">43</a></span>] and gives users of the platform the option of gaining access (through authorization and verification tokens) and deleting their data. While one of the functions of Leora is to build connectivity between users and therapists, it also puts the choice of what data is shared in the hands of users.</p>\n",

       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Appropriate acknowledgment of the scope of support in digital mental health solutions is a pillar of ethical development and patient care [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref30\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></span>]. It is critical for conversational agents to be transparent about the scope of their abilities. Leora is not designed to assist with mental health crises. Clear warnings and postings of this message appropriately indicate to users the scope of the platform. Abuse, self-harm, severe mental health conditions that may cause feelings of suicide, and any other medical emergencies are generally out of the scope of conversational agents. Leora cannot and will not offer medical or clinical advice to individuals, so if presented with a mental health crisis it will instead direct clients to emergency mental health services.</p>\n",
       "<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Discussion\" data-label=\"Discussion\">Discussion</h3>\n",
       "<h4>Principal Findings</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">As the use of AI-powered mental health chatbots becomes more widespread, ethical design and development must be considered. One pillar of the ethical integration of AI into mental health treatment is trust and transparency. Clinicians and patients may be hesitant to trust these platforms if they do not have a basic understanding of how the algorithms work to provide care [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref44\" rel=\"footnote\">44</a></span>]. To address this issue, it is imperative that the detailed development, testing, and deployment of AI chatbots be transparent to clinicians and consumers. This means clearly explaining the algorithms and processes that the chatbots use to generate responses, as well as the limitations of the technology and any and all risks to users. By providing this information, clinicians and patients may make more informed decisions about the advice provided by an AI chatbot and how to use it effectively.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Another important consideration for conversational agents is the potential for bias and health inequity. This is especially pertinent for groups with low health literacy levels, who may not be native speakers or people living with a disability. To ensure that chatbots are accessible, developers must design the technology to be user-friendly and easy to understand. This may involve providing clear and concise explanations of the chatbots’ responses as well as offering multiple ways for users to interact with the technology (eg, through text, voice, or other means).</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">McGreevey et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref30\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></span>] suggest that there are several research and developmental considerations in the development of effective and ethical AI conversational agents. Some of the key research and development challenges for researchers going forward include evaluating the effectiveness of different approaches or tones for conversational agents, such as empathetic and stoic tones, terse and engaging delivery, and gendered delivery of care. Understanding the reasons why some patients stop using conversational agents is also crucial for improving technology. Longitudinal evaluation of patient outcomes with conversational agents is also crucial. This can help researchers determine the effectiveness of the technology in delivering mental health care across demographics and differing client needs. By addressing these research and development questions, researchers can help ensure that AI-powered conversational agents are used effectively in the introductory phase of this technology and provide the greatest benefit to individuals in the long term.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Further research should also consider the changing needs of patients. Ratheesh and Alvarez-Jimenez [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref6\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></span>] note that with improvements in technology and an overall improved comfort with technology, it is possible for technology to change and adapt to the expectations and needs of its users. Given that research suggests that the relationship between the individual and clinician is one of the strongest correlates of successful treatment [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref45\" rel=\"footnote\">45</a></span>], further research is required to determine patient values and preferences for the role of AI-powered mental health support, such as in providing a pathway to developing successful therapeutic alliances.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Supporting innovation in the development of AI-powered conversational agents for mental health is essential to ensuring that patients have access to the most advanced and effective treatments available. However, it is also important to balance this goal with the need to protect patients. While the ethical development of AI is paramount, conservative approaches to the implementation of cutting-edge technology need to be balanced with supporting innovation with the potential to positively impact individuals on a large scale. One way to support innovation while still protecting patients is to carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of any new technology before it is introduced. This might involve conducting clinical trials to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the technology, as well as engaging with key stakeholders such as patients, health care providers, and ethics experts to ensure that any potential concerns are addressed. Ultimately, supporting innovation in the development of AI-powered conversational agents for mental health will require a careful balance between boundary-pushing and the need to protect patients.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Moving forward, it is imperative for AI-powered mental health support to test the clinical outcomes for specific mental health disorders. While previous research has tested usefulness, acceptability, and perception [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref46\" rel=\"footnote\">46</a></span>], clinical effectiveness and reduction in the symptomology of depression, distress, and stress need to be tested more rigorously. A recent meta-analysis concluded that while there was promise for conversational agents, the evidence for them was currently weak due to the limited number of clinical trials and the high estimated risk of bias in the current evidence base [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref47\" rel=\"footnote\">47</a></span>]. Future research should aim to rectify this problem using a combination of participant-centered action research and traditional randomized control trials of AI-powered chatbots with a comparative therapeutic approach (eg, human-led solution-focused counseling).</p>\n",
       "<h4>Conclusions</h4>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Digital mental health development is an important and necessary component of mental health service delivery. The Leora platform is a promising addition to self-led mental health help that leverages AI and humanistic therapy to support and triage individuals to appropriate mental health services. This is significant given the increasing demand and limited supply of mental health treatments worldwide. Notably, it meets the agreed pathways and development standards set by the Australian Government’s National Digital Mental Health Framework [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref48\" rel=\"footnote\">48</a></span>]. The integration of AI-powered chatbots into mental health service delivery is a logical innovation toward increasing equitable and free mental health service access globally. It necessitates certain ethical considerations to foster trust and transparency between client users and service providers. It is therefore essential in these early years of AI mental health support innovation that the development and deployment of AI chatbots are transparent to clinicians and consumers in order to rapidly and safely meet client demand and provide for best-practice use of the technology as an adjunct to existing clinical services. To do this, a layperson’s explanation of both the algorithms and processes that leverage chatbots’ data and the limitations of the technology will ensure a robust model of care. Ideally, this technology should aid clinicians and patients in making informed decisions about mental health treatment and services. Developers should remain vigilant against clinical and user experience bias. Moreover, equity should remain at the forefront of designing these tools to promote user acceptability, particularly for groups with low health literacy, nonnative speakers, or those living with a disability.</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">As AI for mental health support refines over the coming years, specifically for triaging clients in mental distress and conducting accurate psychometric testing, it has the potential to significantly benefit the strained traditional mental health system (ie, general practitioners, psychologists, and psychiatrists). By incorporating sophisticated yet clinician-monitored data sharing between AI systems like Leora and digital patient health records, this technology has the ability to provide the results of clinically validated longitudinal measures to these health care professionals, which in turn may expedite the treatment and recovery process of individuals with complex cases in a timely manner. The next step will be to test the Leora platform’s ability to deliver timely and effective mental health treatment.</p>\n",

       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Background: </span>Achieving the  target for eliminating tuberculosis (TB) in India by 2025, 5 years ahead of the global target, critically depends on strengthening the capacity of human resources as one of the key components of the health system. Due to the rapid updates of standards and protocols, the human resources for TB health care suffer from a lack of understanding of recent updates and acquiring necessary knowledge.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Objective: </span>Despite an increasing focus on the digital revolution in health care, there is no such platform available to deliver the key updates in national TB control programs with easy access. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore the development and evolution of a mobile health tool for capacity building of the Indian health system’s workforce to better manage patients with TB.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Methods: </span>This study involved two phases. The first phase was based on a qualitative investigation, including personal interviews to understand the basic requirements of staff working in the management of patients with TB, followed by participatory consultative meetings with stakeholders to validate and develop the content for the mobile health app. Qualitative information was collected from the Purbi Singhbhum and Ranchi districts of Jharkhand and Gandhinagar, and from the Surat districts of Gujarat State. In the second phase, a participatory design process was undertaken as part of the content creation and validation exercises.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Results: </span>The first phase collected information from 126 health care staff, with a mean age of 38.4 (SD 8.9) years and average work experience of 8.9 years. The assessment revealed that more than two-thirds of participants needed further training and lacked knowledge of the most current updates to TB program guidelines. The consultative process determined the need for a digital solution in easily accessible formats and ready reckoner content to deliver practical solutions to address operational issues for implementation of the program. Ultimately, the digital platform named Ni-kshay SETU (Support to End Tuberculosis) was developed to support the knowledge enhancement of health care workers.<br></p>\n",
       "<p><span class=\"abstract-sub-heading\">Conclusions: </span>The development of staff capacity is vital to the success or failure of any program or intervention. Having up-to-date information provides confidence to health care staff when interacting with patients in the community and aids in making quick judgments when handling case scenarios. Ni-kshay SETU represents a novel digital capacity-building platform for enhancing human resource skills in achieving the goal of TB elimination.<br></p>\n",

There is significant demand for scalable and effective web-based mental health services. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve mental health through the deployment of chatbots. These chatbots can provide round-the-clock support and triage individuals who are reluctant to access traditional health care due to stigma. The aim of this viewpoint paper is to consider the feasibility of AI-powered platforms to support mental well-being. The Leora model is considered a model with the potential to provide mental health support. Leora is a conversational agent that uses AI to engage in conversations with users about their mental health and provide support for minimal-to-mild symptoms of anxiety and depression. The tool is designed to be accessible, personalized, and discreet, offering strategies for promoting well-being and acting as a web-based self-care coach. Across all AI-powered mental health services, there are several challenges in the ethical development and deployment of AI in mental health treatment, including trust and transparency, bias and health inequity, and the potential for negative consequences. To ensure the effective and ethical use of AI in mental health care, researchers must carefully consider these challenges and engage with key stakeholders to provide high-quality mental health support. Validation of the Leora platform through rigorous user testing will be the next step in ensuring the model is effective.</p>\\n<h3 class=\"h3-main-heading\" id=\"Keywords\">Keywords</h3>\\n<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Digital-Mental-Health\" data-label=\"Digital-Mental-Health\">Digital Mental Health</h3>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Mental health is a significant public health concern. Globally, it is estimated that 1 in every 8 people lives with a mental disorder [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></span>]. Mental health service use for depression was estimated to range from 33% in high-income countries to 8% in low- and middle-income countries [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></span>]. A significant gap exists between mental ill-health and access to clinical services. Further, global estimates have not yet captured the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some preliminary estimates suggest that an additional 76.2 million cases of anxiety disorders could be attributed to COVID-19 [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref3\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></span>].</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The outbreak of COVID-19 and subsequent stay-at-home requirements from governments across the world were the precursors to a significant increase in the demand for mental health services [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref4\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></span>]. Amid uncertainty in health and employment, individuals reported that mental ill-health was exacerbated [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref4\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></span>]. In response, the World Health Organization stated, “the scaling-up and reorganization of mental health services that is now needed on a global scale is an opportunity to build a mental health system that is fit for the future” [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref5\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></span>].</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Web-based mental health services are a key to improved service delivery that can be augmented to meet the needs of the changing times ahead [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref6\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></span>]. Telehealth appointments, whose reach was expanded during the pandemic, are an effective way digital health was deployed. Research suggests that the expansion of telehealth services was generally well-accepted [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref7\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></span>]. However, long wait times limit the accessibility of telehealth services. Moreover, the demand for clinically effective web-based mental health tools and services far exceeds the supply [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref8\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref9\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></span>]. COVID-19 required a significant rethinking and restructuring of what effective mental health care service delivery looks like. With this, evidence-based, efficacious, and easily scalable digital mental health services are increasingly needed.</p>\\n<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Artificial-Intelligence-in-the-Context-of-Mental-Health-Treatment\" data-label=\"Artificial-Intelligence-in-the-Context-of-Mental-Health-Treatment\">Artificial Intelligence in the Context of Mental Health Treatment</h3>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of computer systems to display intelligent behavior by analyzing an environment and taking action with some degree of autonomy [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref10\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></span>]. In health care, AI is prominently used in the context of predicting, detecting, and treating illness. This is particularly useful when developing solutions for large-scale problems. Burgeoning examples of this can be found in clinical settings [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref11\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></span>] as well as in translational medical research [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref12\" rel=\"footnote\">12</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref13\" rel=\"footnote\">13</a></span>]. Another way AI is being used is in chatbots, where it has the potential to make an impact in the area of mental health [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref14\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref15\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></span>]. Chatbots are software that engages in dialog with individuals using natural language [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref16\" rel=\"footnote\">16</a></span>].</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The advent of these mental health bots has the potential to be useful in several ways. For one, therapeutic chatbots can provide a platform for individuals to engage at any hour of the day in self-help. Ready access to digital therapies and tools is important given that distressed individuals may seek help outside business hours. Bots also have the potential to triage individuals who feel stigmatized by the current health care model and who otherwise would not be comfortable accessing treatment. Reluctance to access help due to the fear of being judged or labeled is a significant barrier for individuals to access mental health support [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref17\" rel=\"footnote\">17</a></span>]. Men and some minority groups report stigma as being particularly prolific in this context [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref18\" rel=\"footnote\">18</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref19\" rel=\"footnote\">19</a></span>].</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Woebot [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref20\" rel=\"footnote\">20</a></span>] and Wysa [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref21\" rel=\"footnote\">21</a></span>] are 2 examples of AI chatbots in the field of mental health. Woebot uses cognitive behavioral therapy and was found to significantly reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in young adults [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref15\" rel=\"footnote\">15</a></span>]. Wysa also reported a reduction in self-reported symptoms of depression and reported that 68% of the cohort found the app helpful and encouraging [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref14\" rel=\"footnote\">14</a></span>]. These tools show potential for AI mental health chatbots; however, critiques have been made about the size of the sample in the validation studies and the lack of research on their long-term efficacy [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref22\" rel=\"footnote\">22</a></span>]. Given the potential for AI-powered tools to address mental ill-health at scale, further research into the development and validity of this technology needs to be completed.</p>\\n<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Challenges-of-AI-in-Mental-Health-Treatment\" data-label=\"Challenges-of-AI-in-Mental-Health-Treatment\">Challenges of AI in Mental Health Treatment</h3>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Providing mental health treatments necessitates ethical scrutiny, especially when incorporating AI into brief assessments and the support of users. The difficulty of designing ethically robust interventions with AI is that ethical design and review cannot remain a one-off, as the technology itself is continuously developing for both the user and clinical providers [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref23\" rel=\"footnote\">23</a></span>]. Transparency in the development and limitations of AI are important considerations. For example, how an algorithm works to predict and learn is especially important to understand in the context of mental health, particularly regarding how it relates to patient safety and the potential provision of clinical advice. Further, confidentiality and anonymity are a particular concern for mental health tool users, given the stigma associated with mental ill-health [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref24\" rel=\"footnote\">24</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref25\" rel=\"footnote\">25</a></span>], as are data ownership and privacy rights, which are difficult but important elements to manage [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref26\" rel=\"footnote\">26</a></span>].</p>\\n<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"The-Proposed-Model\" data-label=\"The-Proposed-Model\">The Proposed Model</h3>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">In consideration of the aforementioned challenges of AI development for mental health support, the AI platform Leora has incorporated a model of development that is transparent, ethical, and user-focused with regard to data privacy. An understanding that AI is currently best suited as a mental health support tool and early service entrance assistant for users has guided the development of Leora toward its focus as an AI mental health support program.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Leora is a conversational agent that leverages AI to engage in discussions with users about their mental health. Accessible via a web browser and mobile app, this digital toolkit has the capacity to assist individuals with mental ill-health by assessing, monitoring, and managing minimal-to-mild symptoms of anxiety and depression. Further, Leora provides evidence-based strategies to cope with distress and promote well-being. Leora is positioned as a web-based self-care coach and offers easily accessible, personalized, and discreet mental health support.</p>\\n<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Leora’s-Roadmap-for-AI-Support\" data-label=\"Leora’s-Roadmap-for-AI-Support\">Leora’s Roadmap for AI Support</h3>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">An interaction with Leora is illustrated in <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure1\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 1</a></span>. The first step is identifying the individual’s needs. This is an important component of patient-centered care and is associated with more promising patient outcomes [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref27\" rel=\"footnote\">27</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref28\" rel=\"footnote\">28</a></span>]. AI can gauge the appropriate clinical need via a standardized evaluation tool for anxiety and depression, which are the most common mental health concerns [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></span>]. It can do this by using natural language processing—an algorithm that allows a computer to understand language as it is spoken and written [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref29\" rel=\"footnote\">29</a></span>].</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">An important ethical consideration in developing and implementing AI digital health solutions in the mental health field is that solutions and services must provide clinically appropriate recommendations [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref30\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></span>]. By integrating the standardized measures of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item scale (PHQ-9) into the platform, recommendations and referrals will be clinically valid in terms of criterion, construct, factorial, and procedural validity (see [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref31\" rel=\"footnote\">31</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref32\" rel=\"footnote\">32</a></span>] for GAD-7 validity testing and [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref33\" rel=\"footnote\">33</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref34\" rel=\"footnote\">34</a></span>] for PHQ-9 validity testing). Individuals with clinically significant scores on these measures will be directed to mental health services to book an in-person therapy session. Individuals with low or no indication of anxiety and depression symptoms will be directed to psychoeducation and mindfulness strategies, deemed efficacious for those needing to understand their mood and cognitive changes. This approach to care is standardized and is well-used by many web-based mental health services [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref35\" rel=\"footnote\">35</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref36\" rel=\"footnote\">36</a></span>]. Individuals with mild depression and anxiety scores will be directed to strategies to manage these factors based on mental health first aid techniques grounded in brief cognitive behavioral therapy [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref37\" rel=\"footnote\">37</a></span>,<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref38\" rel=\"footnote\">38</a></span>] and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, also known as mindfulness [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref39\" rel=\"footnote\">39</a></span>].</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\"><span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure2\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 2</a></span> illustrates a flowchart of the evaluation of mental health support strategies that Leora would offer an individual. If strategies to reduce the impact of depression and anxiety were not considered helpful\\xa0by\\xa0the individual, the platform would refer the\\xa0user\\xa0to another strategy that may\\xa0provide improved support. If the strategy is considered effective by the individual, posttechnique support and maintenance sessions may be offered.</p>\\n<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Blending-AI-and-Humanistic-Therapy\" data-label=\"Blending-AI-and-Humanistic-Therapy\">Blending AI and Humanistic Therapy</h3>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">The platform blends AI with authentic, human-first, psychological support known as humanistic therapy [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref40\" rel=\"footnote\">40</a></span>]. The conversational agent can engage in meaningful conversations with the individual, conduct standardized assessments, and book therapy for those who need more support (see <span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#figure3\" rel=\"footnote\">Figure 3</a></span> for the interface examples).</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Patient safety is paramount throughout client engagement. Leora has developed “escalation pathways” into the design of triaging patients. A self-assessment that indicates an individual has clinically significant levels of anxiety and depression will be referred to appropriate services, such as a psychologist or a local mental health emergency contact (eg, a mental health crisis website or phone service). In the instance that the client meets the criteria for a referral process, the platform would assist the user to access an appointment with nonconfrontational wording, for example, “You might want to get support beyond what I can help you and that’s not a problem at all! I know a network of experienced mental health professionals. I can assist you in booking sessions with them.”</p>\\n<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Evaluating-the-Efficacy-of-Care\" data-label=\"Evaluating-the-Efficacy-of-Care\">Evaluating the Efficacy of Care</h3>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Accessibility, equity, clinical effectiveness, user acceptability, and satisfaction, as well as service efficiency, are components of ethical digital health solutions [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref41\" rel=\"footnote\">41</a></span>] and can be evaluated by data drawn from Leora. As such, data collected from the cycle of support and evaluation of individual users can be assessed and integrated back into the model to improve the AI service. This iterative design process, characteristic of AI and machine learning models, gives Leora scope to improve by integrating the experiences of a variety of users. Independently, qualitative feedback and internal or external user experience testing are additional layers of evidence to cross-reference with the review data of client sessions with Leora.</p>\\n<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Data-Safety-Encryption-and-Anonymity\" data-label=\"Data-Safety-Encryption-and-Anonymity\">Data Safety, Encryption, and Anonymity</h3>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Leora is stored on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud servers and is secured by virtual private cloud networking configurations. Data are protected from exposure to the public-facing internet through the strict configuration of security groups, subnet settings, and the use of identity access management. This establishes the highest degree of privacy for collected data and ensures that it cannot be leveraged for commercial use. Leora’s architecture is protected by the AWS Encryption Software Development Kit (Amazon Web Services, Inc), which uses envelope encryption. This form of multilayered encryption involves first generating a key for the data chunk at the application layer and then wrapping or encrypting this key again at the storage layer, creating a hierarchy of keys with access governance controlled by identity access management [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref42\" rel=\"footnote\">42</a></span>]. To decrypt the encrypted message, the AWS Encryption Software Development Kit uses the wrapping key to decrypt at least one encrypted data key. It can then decrypt the ciphertext and return a plaintext message. Leora is compliant with the Australian Privacy Policy [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref43\" rel=\"footnote\">43</a></span>] and gives users of the platform the option of gaining access (through authorization and verification tokens) and deleting their data. While one of the functions of Leora is to build connectivity between users and therapists, it also puts the choice of what data is shared in the hands of users.</p>\\n<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Transparency-of-Scope\" data-label=\"Transparency-of-Scope\">Transparency of Scope</h3>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Appropriate acknowledgment of the scope of support in digital mental health solutions is a pillar of ethical development and patient care [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref30\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></span>]. It is critical for conversational agents to be transparent about the scope of their abilities. Leora is not designed to assist with mental health crises. Clear warnings and postings of this message appropriately indicate to users the scope of the platform. Abuse, self-harm, severe mental health conditions that may cause feelings of suicide, and any other medical emergencies are generally out of the scope of conversational agents. Leora cannot and will not offer medical or clinical advice to individuals, so if presented with a mental health crisis it will instead direct clients to emergency mental health services.</p>\\n<h3 class=\"navigation-heading h3-main-heading\" id=\"Discussion\" data-label=\"Discussion\">Discussion</h3>\\n<h4>Principal Findings</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">As the use of AI-powered mental health chatbots becomes more widespread, ethical design and development must be considered. One pillar of the ethical integration of AI into mental health treatment is trust and transparency. Clinicians and patients may be hesitant to trust these platforms if they do not have a basic understanding of how the algorithms work to provide care [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref44\" rel=\"footnote\">44</a></span>]. To address this issue, it is imperative that the detailed development, testing, and deployment of AI chatbots be transparent to clinicians and consumers. This means clearly explaining the algorithms and processes that the chatbots use to generate responses, as well as the limitations of the technology and any and all risks to users. By providing this information, clinicians and patients may make more informed decisions about the advice provided by an AI chatbot and how to use it effectively.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Another important consideration for conversational agents is the potential for bias and health inequity. This is especially pertinent for groups with low health literacy levels, who may not be native speakers or people living with a disability. To ensure that chatbots are accessible, developers must design the technology to be user-friendly and easy to understand. This may involve providing clear and concise explanations of the chatbots’ responses as well as offering multiple ways for users to interact with the technology (eg, through text, voice, or other means).</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">McGreevey et al [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref30\" rel=\"footnote\">30</a></span>] suggest that there are several research and developmental considerations in the development of effective and ethical AI conversational agents. Some of the key research and development challenges for researchers going forward include evaluating the effectiveness of different approaches or tones for conversational agents, such as empathetic and stoic tones, terse and engaging delivery, and gendered delivery of care. Understanding the reasons why some patients stop using conversational agents is also crucial for improving technology. Longitudinal evaluation of patient outcomes with conversational agents is also crucial. This can help researchers determine the effectiveness of the technology in delivering mental health care across demographics and differing client needs. By addressing these research and development questions, researchers can help ensure that AI-powered conversational agents are used effectively in the introductory phase of this technology and provide the greatest benefit to individuals in the long term.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Further research should also consider the changing needs of patients. Ratheesh and Alvarez-Jimenez [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref6\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></span>] note that with improvements in technology and an overall improved comfort with technology, it is possible for technology to change and adapt to the expectations and needs of its users. Given that research suggests that the relationship between the individual and clinician is one of the strongest correlates of successful treatment [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref45\" rel=\"footnote\">45</a></span>], further research is required to determine patient values and preferences for the role of AI-powered mental health support, such as in providing a pathway to developing successful therapeutic alliances.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Supporting innovation in the development of AI-powered conversational agents for mental health is essential to ensuring that patients have access to the most advanced and effective treatments available. However, it is also important to balance this goal with the need to protect patients. While the ethical development of AI is paramount, conservative approaches to the implementation of cutting-edge technology need to be balanced with supporting innovation with the potential to positively impact individuals on a large scale. One way to support innovation while still protecting patients is to carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of any new technology before it is introduced. This might involve conducting clinical trials to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the technology, as well as engaging with key stakeholders such as patients, health care providers, and ethics experts to ensure that any potential concerns are addressed. Ultimately, supporting innovation in the development of AI-powered conversational agents for mental health will require a careful balance between boundary-pushing and the need to protect patients.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Moving forward, it is imperative for AI-powered mental health support to test the clinical outcomes for specific mental health disorders. While previous research has tested usefulness, acceptability, and perception [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref46\" rel=\"footnote\">46</a></span>], clinical effectiveness and reduction in the symptomology of depression, distress, and stress need to be tested more rigorously. A recent meta-analysis concluded that while there was promise for conversational agents, the evidence for them was currently weak due to the limited number of clinical trials and the high estimated risk of bias in the current evidence base [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref47\" rel=\"footnote\">47</a></span>]. Future research should aim to rectify this problem using a combination of participant-centered action research and traditional randomized control trials of AI-powered chatbots with a comparative therapeutic approach (eg, human-led solution-focused counseling).</p>\\n<h4>Conclusions</h4>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">Digital mental health development is an important and necessary component of mental health service delivery. The Leora platform is a promising addition to self-led mental health help that leverages AI and humanistic therapy to support and triage individuals to appropriate mental health services. This is significant given the increasing demand and limited supply of mental health treatments worldwide. Notably, it meets the agreed pathways and development standards set by the Australian Government’s National Digital Mental Health Framework [<span class=\"footers\"><a class=\"citation-link\" href=\"#ref48\" rel=\"footnote\">48</a></span>]. The integration of AI-powered chatbots into mental health service delivery is a logical innovation toward increasing equitable and free mental health service access globally. It necessitates certain ethical considerations to foster trust and transparency between client users and service providers. It is therefore essential in these early years of AI mental health support innovation that the development and deployment of AI chatbots are transparent to clinicians and consumers in order to rapidly and safely meet client demand and provide for best-practice use of the technology as an adjunct to existing clinical services. To do this, a layperson’s explanation of both the algorithms and processes that leverage chatbots’ data and the limitations of the technology will ensure a robust model of care. Ideally, this technology should aid clinicians and patients in making informed decisions about mental health treatment and services. Developers should remain vigilant against clinical and user experience bias. Moreover, equity should remain at the forefront of designing these tools to promote user acceptability, particularly for groups with low health literacy, nonnative speakers, or those living with a disability.</p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">As AI for mental health support refines over the coming years, specifically for triaging clients in mental distress and conducting accurate psychometric testing, it has the potential to significantly benefit the strained traditional mental health system (ie, general practitioners, psychologists, and psychiatrists). By incorporating sophisticated yet clinician-monitored data sharing between AI systems like Leora and digital patient health records, this technology has the ability to provide the results of clinically validated longitudinal measures to these health care professionals, which in turn may expedite the treatment and recovery process of individuals with complex cases in a timely manner. The next step will be to test the Leora platform’s ability to deliver timely and effective mental health treatment.</p>\\n<h4 class=\"h4-border-top\">Conflicts of Interest</h4>\\n<p></p>\\n<p class=\"abstract-paragraph\">AJC is on the advisory board of Leora to ensure the ethical and safe development of the Leora platform.
